The '''Academy of Natural Sciences of [[Drexel University]]''', formerly the '''Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia''', is the oldest [[natural science]] research institution and [[museum]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading [[naturalist]]s of the young American republic with an expressed mission of "the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences". For over two centuries of continuous operations, the Academy has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and [[systematics]] research, and amassed [[natural history]] collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also has a long tradition of public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.

==History==
During the first decades of the United States, [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] was the cultural capital and one of the country's commercial centers. Two of the city's institutions, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.

The increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the great variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness waiting to be discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals.

On 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGY7AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817+january+OR+february+OR+march+OR+april+OR+may+OR+june+OR+july+OR+august+OR+september+OR+october+OR+november+OR+december&amp;ots=ogxVDjRrOn&amp;sig=i_H8ZqJXsvMNdjc1ZGpf4WkXkXQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDjIC-0ejKAhVE5mMKHYiSCzQQ6AEIbjAQ&amp;q=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817+january+OR+february+OR+march+OR+april+OR+may+OR+june+OR+july+OR+august+OR+september+OR+october+OR+november+OR+december|title=The Annals of Philosophy|date=4 November 2017|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including [[William Bartram]], John Godman, [[Richard Harlan]], [[Angelo Heilprin]], [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]], [[William Maclure]], [[Titian Peale]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]], [[Thomas Say]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[John Edwards Holbrook]] of South Carolina, [[Thomas Nuttall]] and  [[Richard Owen]] of the United Kingdom, [[Georges Cuvier]] of France, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy's first decades.

Later during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Distinctions between who is a naturalist and who is a scientist varies and can be elusive. One can make the distinction that naturalists are amateurs interested in the natural sciences, whereas scientists are professionals. This distinction, however, is confounded by history and circumstance. Most of the participants in American science during the 19th century were not professionals, although some of their contributions are of the highest order.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[John James Audubon]], Charles S. Boyer, [[John Cassin]], [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Ezra Townsend Cresson]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[John Lawrence LeConte]], [[Joseph Leidy]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Leidy, the man who first studied ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', is considered the "father" of American paleontology and American [[Parasitology]] and was a leading teacher and authority on microscopy and comparative anatomy. He is widely regarded to have been the leading expert on the natural sciences during the 19th century. More about Leidy can be found on the Academy's [http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy online exhibit on Joseph Leidy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Morton, [[George Ord]], and James Rehn were also members. Corresponding members included such luminaries as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Asa Gray]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].

For much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James Böhlke, [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Henry Weed Fowler]], [[Ruth Patrick]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]], and [[Witmer Stone]].

In 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby [[Drexel University]] and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2011 |title=The Academy of Natural Sciences and Drexel University Announce a Historic Affiliation |url=http://www.ansp.org/about/academy-drexel-affiliation.php |publisher=Academy of Natural Science |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2011-05-19 |title=Academy of Natural Sciences to become Drexel subsidiary |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/05/19/academy-of-natural-sciences-to-become.html |first=Peter Van |last=Allen |work=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and research==
[[File:JVBA Mosasaur 6-09-2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 43 ft. (13 m) complete fossil specimen of Mosasaur species ''[[Tylosaurus]] proriger'' (with a human for scale) is on display.]]
[[Collection (museum)|Collections]] are the hallmark of museums and those at The Academy of Natural Sciences are among the more important of their kind. The size and scope of its collections have grown substantially since the early years. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, [[Biological illustration|illustrations]], photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections grew through a combination of means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Sometimes the Academy is also enlisted to house and care for collections originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.

But these collections are not maintained just to collect dust. They provide a library of [[biodiversity]]. Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in [[Alpha taxonomy|biological taxonomy]], the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species: in essence, the cataloging of Nature. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of [[systematics]], the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species.

Either way, the collections are invaluable. They provide the [[Biological type|type specimens]], the reference material that helps establish a species' identity. They also provide raw materials with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status. New questions and new technology illustrate the importance of these collections. [[Titian Peale]] (1799–1885) may not have been interested in the conservation biology of the butterflies he collected while [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]] (1862–1957) probably did not consider comparing the DNA of his snails. Yet, modern scientists have such options because these specimens are part of the collections.

===Biological systematics===
The most common science currently conducted in natural history museums is [[Systematics|biological systematics]]. It is also the science with which current natural history collections are most intimately associated.  The Academy's collections and systematics research are presented below.

====Botany====
[[Botany]]  is study of plants. "Plants," to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.
Collections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia [[Herbarium]] (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Constatine Rafinesque]], [[Thomas Meehan (botanist)|Thomas Meehan]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], and [[Frederick Traugott Pursh|Fredrick Pursh]]. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the [[Plant evolutionary developmental biology|development of flowers]] in  the [[Apocynaceae]] (milkweed or dogbane family). The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of [[vascular plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Johann]] and [[Georg Forster]] during the voyages of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]], and by [[Meriwether Lewis]] during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery)]].

====Diatoms====
The Academy's [[Diatoms|Diatom]] [[Herbarium]], the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the [[#Phycology|Phycology Section]] of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, [[Ruth Patrick]], and Charles Reimer.

====Entomology====
[[Entomology]] has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include [[Thomas Say]], regarded as the father of American entomology, and [[Titian Peale]], a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition]] (1834–1842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the remarkable Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Senior curator [[Dan Otte|Daniel Otte]], an expert on [[Orthoptera]] (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the [http://osf2.orthoptera.org/HomePage.aspx Orthoptera Species File]. Another curator, Jon Gelhaus, an expert on [[Crane fly|crane flies]], manages the [[#Mongolian_Aquatic_Insect_Survey|Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey]]..

====Ichthyology====
[[Ichthyology]] has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s personal collections in 1898. A few years later, [[Henry Weed Fowler]] began his remarkable tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. [[James Edwin Böhlke]], William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the notable scientist who followed Fowler. The current curator, John Lundberg, an expert in [[catfish]]es, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and [[Paleogeography|geographic history]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River Basin]]. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the [http://silurus.ansp.org/ All Catfish Species Inventory] (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and [http://catfishbone.ansp.org/ Catfish Bones] (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in [http://www.neodat.org/ Neodat II] (an online resource of [[Neotropics|Neotropic]] ichthyology collections).

====Malacology====
Two of the early members of the Academy, [[Thomas Say]] and [[Isaac Lea]], were [[Malacology|malacologists]] (see also [[Conchology|conchologists]]). [[R. Tucker Abbott]], [[Samuel Stehman Haldeman]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry A. Pilsbry]], and [[George W. Tryon, Jr.]] were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy's malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator [[Gary Rosenberg]], an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in moving museum collections and research data online. Research websites include the [http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/georef/ Malacology Georeferencing Project] an online database of [http://www.malacolog.org/Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca (Malacolog)]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080327102600/http://data.acnatsci.org/obis/ OBIS Indo-Pacific Mollusc] database.  Research associate and former curator Daniel L. Graf, an expert on [[Unionidae]] (freshwater mussels), maintains the [http://clade.acnatsci.org/mussel/ MUSSEL Project] web site.

====Ornithology====
Just about any ornithologist active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including [[John James Audubon]], [[William Bartram]], [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]], [[John Cassin]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], [[George Ord]], [[John Kirk Townsend]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] (the "father" of American [[ornithology]]), either operated out of or worked closely with The Academy of Natural Sciences. Later notable Academy ornithologists include [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], [[Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee]], Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and [[Witmer Stone]]. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The [[Delaware Valley Ornithological Club]] (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.

====Vertebrate paleontology====
[[Vertebrate Paleontology|Vertebrate paleontology]] in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the [[American Philosophical Society]] (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905164059/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/ Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection], had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. [[Richard Harlan]] was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of [[Georges Cuvier]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ Joseph Leidy], who described ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the "father" of American vertebrate paleontology. [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] during the infamous [[Bone Wars]]. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of [[Devonian]] [[tetrapod]]s. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional "fishapod" ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]'' from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, ''[[Hynerpeton]]'' and ''Densignathus'' from the [[Catskill Formation]] in Pennsylvania.

====Other collections====
The Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general [[invertebrate]] collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the [[invertebrate paleontology]] collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens.&lt;ref name="Academy of Natural Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammalogy|url=http://www.ansp.org/research/systematics-evolution/collections/mammalogy/|publisher=Department of Vertebrate Zoology|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of [[rotifer]]s on microslides. The [[herpetology]] collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The [[mammalogy]] collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 [[holotype]]s. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[John Edwards Holbrook]], [[Henry Charles Lea]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[Joseph Leidy]], Samuel G. Morton, and [[Thomas Say]].

===Patrick Center for Environmental Research===
Formerly the [[Limnology]] Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research concerns itself with [[applied ecology]]. Founded in 1947 by [[Ruth Patrick]], formerly of the [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ [[interdisciplinary]] teams of scientists to study [[freshwater]] systems and the first to regard [[biodiversity]] as a central criterion of [[water quality]].

Its 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in [[Environmental science|environmental research]], led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in [[United States environmental law|governmental regulation]] of [[water pollution]], the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private [[Environmental consulting|environmental consulting firms]].

{{as of|2013}}, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology,&lt;ref&gt;Autecology is the study the interaction of an individual organism or individual species with its physical, chemical and biological environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Particulars may include such measures as temperature preferences, pollution tolerance, light requirements, and ability to recover after disturbance.&lt;/ref&gt; [[environmental chemistry]] and [[Aquatic toxicology|toxicology]], [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]], long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and [[watershed management]]. Some of the work employs most of the center's expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|ecological effects of small dams]] or the ecological benefits of [[Riparian zone|riparian reforestation]].

Other studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling [[Core sample|sediment cores]] in [[tidal marsh]]es throughout the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] [[Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;The Sediment Core work in the Delaware Estuary is being conducted in collaboration with the [[University of Delaware]].&lt;/ref&gt; This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center's expertise in [[biogeochemistry]] and [[phycology]]. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]], [[water pollution]], salinity variations, and [[Global warming|climatic change]] by analyzing the core's sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Biogeochemistry====
The [[Biogeochemistry]] Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of [[Environmental chemistry|chemicals in aquatic systems]]. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of [[Trace metals|trace elements]] (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived [[dissolved organic matter]], and sedimentation and [[eutrophication]] in [[salt marsh]]es.

====Ecological Modeling====
The [[Ecosystem model|Ecological Modeling]] Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modeling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include [[Watershed management|watershed-scale]] modeling and [[risk assessment]]; nonlinear [[Population modeling|population models]] structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in [[Fluid dynamics|turbulent aquatic systems]]; and the ecology and control of [[Introduced species|exotic invasive]] plants in urban parks.

====Fisheries====
The Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, [[Wildlife management|conservation]], and [[Fisheries management|management]] of [[Lotic system ecology|lotic]] and [[estuarine fish]]es. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or [[American eel]]s) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management ([[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|dam releases]]) in the Upper [[Delaware River]] to native and [[Introduced species|introduced fish]] populations.

====Macroinvertebrates====
Benthic macroinvertebrates (primarily [[aquatic insect]]s, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.

====Phycology====
Because of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, [[algae]], particularly [[diatom]]s, make excellent [[Indicator species|indicators of water quality]]. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them ideal organisms for studying [[paleolimnology]] (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). Because of their expertise and their close working relationship with the Academy's [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], the [[Phycology]] Section of the Patrick Center is able to provide algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing [[water quality]] and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments ([[Core sample|sediment cores]]) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], will try to establish reference (pre-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) conditions  for lakes throughout the country.

In addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of [http://diatom.ansp.org online resources] for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the [[USGS]] National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.

===Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology===
For most of its history, biological [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]] were conducted using [[Comparative anatomy|comparative morphology]]. In recent decades, however, advances in [[molecular biology]] and computational technologies have opened [[Molecular systematics|new possibilities]] for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of [[cladistics]] and [[computational phylogenetics]]. These technologies also offer new opportunities for [[molecular ecology]] and [[conservation genetics]].

Academy scientists have been early adapters of [[molecular biology]] techniques. [[Allozymes]], [[DNA-DNA hybridization]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and [[serology]] were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs [[DNA sequencing]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s, and AFLP ([[amplified fragment length polymorphism]]). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.

===Asia Center===
The Asia Center is a new initiative to develop programs and partnerships for research and capacity building throughout Asia. Clyde Goulden is the director of the Asia Center. It is modeled on a series of successful programs conducted in Mongolia since 1995 under the auspices of the Academy's Institute for Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies (IMBES). The main activities of IMBES occur in the vicinity of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, but a separate program, the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey, extends to other parts of the country. More recently, the Asia Center has undertaken joint-projects with [[Nanjing University]], Nanjing Paleontological Museum and Zhejiang Ocean University in China and the Institute of the Biological Problems of the North in the Russian Far East.

====Hovsgol====
The Academy's work in [[Mongolia]] started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at [[Lake Khövsgöl|Lake Hovsgol]] (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, [[Lake Baikal]]. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake's [[biodiversity]], [[limnology]], and watershed.&lt;ref&gt;The findings of this research were published in

&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic development]] needed addressing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mongolia]], recently freed from Soviet domination, was experiencing severe economic disruption and increasing pressures through [[globalization]] to exploit its [[Natural resource management|natural resources]]. Mongolians, committed to preserving their natural heritage, needed assistance in developing their scientific and conservation infrastructure.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to [[Ecosystem ecology|ecosystem studies]] and [[capacity building]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Capacity building]] (the development of local expertise and infrastructure) is implemented in part through the inclusion of scientists and students from the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National University of Mongolia]] in research projects, conferences, and workshops. The Academy has also sponsored the training of Mongolian students in Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Hovsgol National Park, which includes the lake and its entire watershed, was created in 1992. Improvements took the form of improving park management, improving physical facilities, staff training and developing park-community relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term ecological monitoring of several [[Drainage basin|tributary watersheds]] began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the 
[http://www.lternet.edu/ International Long Term Ecological Research Network].&lt;ref&gt;Long-term ecological work at Hovsgol has been supported by the [[Global Environmental Facility]]from 2002-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to [[global warming|climate change]]. The region lies in a transitional zone between the [[Semiarid|semi-arid]] Eurasian [[Steppe]] (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian [[Taiga]] (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Substantial increases in annual mean temperatures and growing season length in this semiarid landscape have resulted in [[permafrost]] loss, drier soils, and reduced plant cover in the steppe. Shifts in the seasonal pattern in precipitation are disruptive to grassland plant reproduction and the incidence of extreme weather also appears to be increasing. Changes in the forests are less demonstrable, but increased [[Wildfire|fire frequency]] and pest insect outbreaks are suggestive.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, changes in livestock herding practices&lt;ref&gt;Traditional [[pastoralism]], or animal herding, has existed in Mongolia for millennia, but recent trends in livestock production and practices may be unsustainable. The herds are larger and cashmere goats, which can be particularly damaging to vegetation, are accounting for a greater percentage of the total. Moreover, much of the traditional herder expertise was lost during the Soviet era. Consequently, herders risk seriously [[overgrazing]] the steppe, which, because of [[global warming]], is increasingly vulnerable to [[desertification]].&lt;/ref&gt; raise concerns about [[overgrazing]] and [[desertification]]. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a ''Herder Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;An English version of the Herder Handbook can be [http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=2 downloaded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215023907/http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=2 |date=2008-02-15 }} from the Hovsgol Ecology website.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Current work at Hovsgol is funded by the [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819 National Science Foundation PIRE program], and is a partnership of the Academy's Asia Center, [http://mongolia.bio.upenn.edu/index.html The University of Pennsylvania], the [http://www.must.edu.mn/ Mongolian Academy of Sciences], the [http://must.edu.mn/ Mongolian University of Science and Technology], and the [http://web.num.edu.mn/eng/ National University of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Information on earlier applied work at Hovsgol can be found at [http://hovsgolecology.org hovsgolecology.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey====
The Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clade.ansp.org/entomology/mongolia/|title=Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey: Splash|website=clade.ansp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-year [[biodiversity]] survey, [[Water quality|environmental monitoring]] and [[capacity building]] project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy's [[#Entomology|Entomology Department]].  A total of 217 sites from the [[Selenge River]] Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.

The survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known [[aquatic insect]]s, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.

===Center for Environmental Policy===
The Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.

The center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.

The center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.

===Ewell Sale Stewart Library===
The Library and Archives were established at the Academy's founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include  illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including [[Conrad Gessner|Konrad Gessner's]] ''Historia animalium'', [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]'s ''Insects of Surinam'', [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Psittacidae or Parrots'', and a double elephant folio of [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421170703/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |archive-date=2008-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific publications===
The ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817.  By 1842, it had been superseded by the ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences''. The ''Proceedings'' have been published continuously since 1841. The ''Journal'' was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and [[monograph]]s. The last volume was issued in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;The volumes of the ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' published from 1817 to 1842 are referred to as the First Series. The Second Series was published from 1847 to 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series ''Notulae Naturae'' began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The ''Monographs'' series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The ''Special Publications'' series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.

===VIREO===
[http://vireo.ansp.org/ VIREO] (VIsual REsource for [[Ornithology]]) is the most comprehensive collection of bird [[Stock photography|images]] in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 140,000 photographs representing more than 7,000 species. The collection contains work by some of the world's most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.

==Exhibits and public programs==

===Public exhibits===
[[File:Mummy PANS.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mummy on display at the Academy]]
The Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world's first mounted dinosaur skeleton, ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.  In fact, the size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.

====Collections and the public====
As with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy's collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Wagner Free Institute of Science]] is an early example of an organized public display of natural history collections. Founded in 1855 to offer free lectures on the natural sciences, the Wagner appointed Joseph Leidy in 1885 to organize its growing collections. Leidy's design is still largely intact, and the Wagner is effectively a museum of a museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dioramas====
One expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the [[diorama]]. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife. By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, in turn, contributed to the growth of the [[Conservation movement|Conservation Movement]] in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[lion]], and [[plains zebra]] are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the [[Desert Bighorn Sheep|desert bighorn]], [[kiang]], [[Kodiak bear]], [[panda]], and [[passenger pigeon]], are threatened, [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Extinction|extinct]].

====Dinosaurs====
[[File:Hadro bones.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A display of casts of the 35 bones of the Hadrosaurus]]
Another icon of natural history museums is the [[dinosaur]] skeleton. The first of these, the ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' mount created by noted natural history artist [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], made its debut at the Academy in 1868. ''Hadrosaurus'' mounts also found their way into other public venues, including [[Princeton University]], the [[Royal Museum|Royal Scottish Museum]], the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], and the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 American Centennial Exposition]]. A special exhibit on the history of ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'' ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.
[[File:T-rex exhibit Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' fossil on display with other dinosaur specimens.]]
A skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', served as the centerpiece of the Academy's "Hall of Earth History" during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, "Discovering Dinosaurs." This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the "[[dinosaur renaissance]]." Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than lizards.

In 1979 another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured [[Jim Gary|Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs]] and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as "contemporary art" as exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Twentieth_Century_Dinosaurs_Return_to_Tallahassee_Museum_128476873.html?storySection=story|title=Twentieth Century Dinosaurs Return to Tallahassee Museum|first=Tallahassee Museum|last=Release|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other exhibits====
In 1979, the academy also opened "Outside-In", a hands-on children's nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its "The Big Dig." Other permanent exhibits include "Butterflies!", a live butterfly zoo, and  "Science at the Academy", which showcases current Academy research.

The museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include "Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other Riches", "Frogs: a Chorus of Colors", "The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Exhibition", and "The Scoop on Poop: The Science of What Animals Leave Behind."

===Public programs===

====Festivals====
Four weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy's Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.

====Programs for adults====
The Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.

====Programs for families and children====
Since its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Scouts]] can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.

"Wild Weekends", held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children's programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.

===Educational programs===

====Field Trips and Outreach====
[[Field Trip]]s to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). "Academy on the Go" is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.

====Women in Natural Sciences====
WINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, [[scientific literacy]] and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.

====Other programs====
Academy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. [[Science fair]] participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.

==Awards and research opportunities==

===Hayden Memorial Geological Award===
The [[Hayden Memorial Geological Award]] is given to prominent scientists working in geology or paleontology. It was established in 1888 in memory of [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], a distinguished American geologist and pioneering surveyor of the American West who had extensive ties to the Academy.

===Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art===
Established in 1980, the Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art is awarded to people whose artistic endeavors and life's work have contributed to our understanding and appreciation of living things.

'''Aerial archaeology''' is the study of archaeological remains by examining them from altitude.

==Details==
The advantages of gaining a good aerial view of the ground had been long appreciated by [[archaeologist]]s as a high viewpoint permits a better appreciation of fine details and their relationships within the wider site context. Early investigators attempted to gain birdseye views of sites using hot air balloons, scaffolds or cameras attached to kites. Following the invention of the [[aeroplane]] and the military importance placed on [[aerial photography]] during the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, archaeologists were able to more effectively use the technique  to discover and record archaeological sites.

Photographs may be taken either vertically, that is from directly overhead, or obliquely, meaning that they are taken at an angle. In order to provide a three-dimensional effect, an overlapping pair of vertical photographs, taken from slightly offset positions, can be viewed [[stereoscope|stereoscopically]].
[[Image:Nazca monkey.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aerial archeological photograph of the [[Nazca Lines|"Nazca monkey"]] in [[Peru]]]]

The advantages of aerial photographs to archaeologists are manifold.

Large sites could for the first time be viewed accurately, in their entirety and within their landscape. This aided the production of drawn plans and also inspired archaeologists to look beyond the discrete [[monument]] and to appreciate a site's role within its setting. Photos are taken vertically for the purposes of planning and [[spatial analysis]] and obliquely to emphasize certain features or give perspective. Through the process of [[photogrammetry]], vertical photos can be converted into scaled plans.

Archaeological features may also be more visible from the air than on the ground. In temperate Europe, aerial reconnaissance is one of the most important ways in which new archaeological sites are discovered. Tiny differences in ground conditions caused by buried features can be emphasised by a number of factors and then viewed from the air:

*Slight differences in ground levels will cast shadows when the sun is low and these can be seen best from an aeroplane. These are referred to as [[shadow mark]]s.
*Buried ditches will hold more water and buried walls will hold less water than undisturbed ground, this phenomenon, amongst others, causes crops to grow better or worse, taller or shorter, over each kind of ground and therefore define buried features which are apparent as tonal or colour differences. Such effects are called [[cropmark]]s.
*Frost can also appear in winter on ploughed fields where water has naturally accumulated along the lines of buried features. These are known as [[frostmark]]s.
*Slight differences in soil colour between natural deposits and archaeological ones can also often show in ploughed fields as [[soilmark]]s
*Differences in levels and buried features will also affect the way surface water behaves across a site and can produce a striking effect after heavy rain.
In cases like the [[Nazca lines]], the features are meaningless from the ground but easily visible from the air.

Pioneers of aerial archaeology include [[Roger Agache]] in Northern [[France]], [[Antoine Poidebard]] in [[Syria]], [[Lionel Rees|L W B Rees]] in Jordan [[O. G. S. Crawford]] in [[England]] and Sir [[Henry Wellcome]] in the Sudan, [[Giacomo Boni (archaeologist)|Giacomo Boni]] in Italy.

Following in the footsteps of [[Henry Wellcome]], [[kite aerial photography]] is now being used on archaeological sites outside the visible spectrum, from the near ultra-violet through to the near and thermal infra-red.

Aerial archaeology is used in the processes of research and investigation in [[aviation archaeology]].

'''Aquatic toxicology''' is the study of the effects of manufactured [[chemical]]s and other [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural materials and activities on [[:Category: aquatic organisms|aquatic organism]]s at various levels of organization, from [[subcellular]] through individual [[organism]]s to communities and [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of aquatic toxicology: Methods and applications |last1=Rand |first1=Gary M. |last2=Petrocelli |first2=Sam R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |publisher=Hemisphere Publishing |location=Washington |isbn=0-89116-382-4 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic toxicology is a multidisciplinary field which integrates [[toxicology]], [[aquatic ecology]] and [[aquatic chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Rand" /&gt;

This field of study includes [[freshwater]], [[marine water]] and [[sediment]] environments. Common tests include standardized acute and chronic toxicity tests lasting 24–96 hours (acute test) to 7 days or more (chronic tests). These tests measure endpoints such as survival, growth, reproduction, that are measured at each concentration in a gradient, along with a control test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/wet/upload/2007_08_06_methods_wet_finalwetv1.pdf "Final Report: Interlaboratory Variability Study of EPA Short-term Chronic and Acute Whole Effluent Toxicity Test Methods, Vol 1."] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Typically using selected organisms with ecologically relevant sensitivity to toxicants and a well-established literature background.  These organisms can be easily acquired or cultured in lab and are easy to handle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/wet/upload/2007_07_10_methods_wet_disk2_atx.pdf "Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms, Fifth Edition."] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While basic research in toxicology began in multiple countries in the 1800s, it was not until around the 1930s that the use of acute toxicity testing, especially on fish, was established. Over the next two decades, the effects of chemicals and wastes on non-human species became more of a public issue and the era of the ''pickle-jar bioassays'' began as efforts increased to standardize toxicity testing techniques.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; 
In the United States of America, the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1947 marked the first comprehensive legislation for the control of water pollution and was followed by the [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/history.cfm "Water Quality Standards History"] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Received 2012-06-06&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, public and governmental interests were renewed, in large part due to the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]’s ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and three years later the [[Clean Water Act#Earlier legislation|Water Quality Act of 1965]] was passed, which directed states to develop water quality standards.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; Public awareness, as well as scientific and governmental concern, continued to grow throughout the 1970s and by the end of the decade research had expanded to include hazard evaluation and [[risk analysis]].&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; In the subsequent decades, aquatic toxicology has continued to expand and internationalize so that there is now a strong application of toxicity testing for [[environmental protection]].

==Aquatic toxicity tests==
Aquatic toxicology tests ([[bioassay|assays]]): toxicity tests are used to provide qualitative and quantitative data on adverse (deleterious) effects on aquatic organisms from a [[wikt:toxicant|toxicant]].  Toxicity tests can be used to assess the potential for damage to an aquatic environment and provide a database that can be used to assess the risk associated within a situation for a specific toxicant.  Aquatic toxicology tests can be performed in the field or in the laboratory.  [[Field experiment]]s generally refer to multiple species exposure&lt;!-- Field exposures can involve the caging of a single species for a set duration. --&gt; and laboratory experiments generally refer to single species exposure. A dose response relationship is most commonly used with a [[sigmoidal curve]] to quantify the toxic effects at a selected end-point or criteria for effect (i.e. death or other adverse effect to the organism).  Concentration is on the x-axis and percent inhibition or response is on the y-axis.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

The criteria for effects, or endpoints tested for, can include lethal and [[sublethal]] effects (see [[#Toxicological effects|Toxicological effects]]).&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

There are different types of toxicity tests that can be performed on various test species.  Different species differ in their susceptibility to chemicals, most likely due to differences in accessibility, [[metabolic rate]], [[excretion rate]], [[genetic factor]]s, dieteary factors, age, sex, health and stress level of the organism.  Common standard test species are the [[fathead minnow]] (Pimephales promelas), [[Daphnia|daphnids]] (''[[Daphnia magna]]'', [[Daphnia pulex|''D. pulex'']], ''D. pulicaria'', ''Ceriodaphnia dubia''), [[midge]] (Chironomus tentans, C. ruparius), [[rainbow trout]] (Oncorhynchus mykiss), [[sheepshead minnow]] (Cyprinodon variegatu)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calow |first1=Peter P |title=Handbook of Ecotoxicology |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1444313509 |pages=900}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[zebra fish]] (''Danio rerio'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Fu-Jun |last2=Wang |first2=Jia-Sheng |last3=Theodorakis |first3=Chris W. |title=Thyrotoxicity of Sodium Arsenate, Sodium Perchlorate, and Their Mixture in ZebrafishDanio rerio |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |date=May 2006 |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=3429–3436 |doi=10.1021/es052538g |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es052538g |language=en |issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[mysids]] (Mysidopsis), [[oyster]] (Crassotreas), [[Amphipoda|scud]] (Hyalalla Azteca), [[grass shrimp]] (Palaemonetes pugio) and [[mussels]] (''[[Mytilus galloprovincialis]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vidal-Liñán |first1=Leticia |last2=Bellas |first2=Juan |last3=Campillo |first3=Juan Antonio |last4=Beiras |first4=Ricardo |title=Integrated use of antioxidant enzymes in mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, for monitoring pollution in highly productive coastal areas of Galicia (NW Spain) |journal=Chemosphere |date=January 2010 |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=265–272 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.10.060}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  As defined by ASTM, these species are routinely selected on the basis of availability, commercial, recreational, and ecological importance, past successful use, and regulatory use.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

A variety of acceptable standardized test methods have been published. Some of the more widely accepted agencies to publish methods are: the [[American Public Health Association]], U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[American Society for Testing and Materials]], [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[Environment Canada]], and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].  Standardized tests offer the ability to compare results between laboratories.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

There are many kinds of toxicity tests widely accepted in the scientific literature and regulatory agencies. The type of test used depends on many factors:  Specific regulatory agency conducting the test, resources available, physical and chemical characteristics of the environment, type of toxicant, test species available, laboratory vs. field testing, end-point selection, and time and resources available to conduct the assays are some of the most common influencing factors on test design.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

===Exposure systems===

[[Exposure science|Exposure systems]] are four general techniques the controls and test organisms are exposed to the dealing with treated and diluted water or the test solutions.
*'''Static.''' A static test exposes the organism in still water. The toxicant is added to the water in order to obtain the correct concentrations to be tested. The control and test organisms are placed in the test solutions and the water is not changed for the entirety of the test.
*'''Recirculation.''' A recirculation test exposes the organism to the toxicant in a similar manner as the static test, except that the test solutions are pumped through an apparatus (i.e. filter) to maintain water quality, but not reduce the concentration of the toxicant in the water. The water is circulated through the test chamber continuously, similar to an aerated fish tank. This type of test is expensive and it is unclear whether or not the filter or aerator has an effect on the toxicant.
*'''Renewal.''' A renewal test also exposes the organism to the toxicant in a similar manner as the static test because it is in still water. However, in a renewal test the test solution is renewed periodically (constant intervals) by transferring the organism to a fresh test chamber with the same concentration of toxicant.
*'''Flow-through.''' A flow-through test exposes the organism to the toxicant with a flow into the test chambers and then out of the test chambers. The once-through flow can either be intermittent or continuous. A stock solution of the correct concentrations of contaminant must be previously prepared. Metering pumps or diluters will control the flow and the volume of the test solution, and the proper proportions of water and contaminant will be mixed.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

===Types of tests===
'''Acute''' tests are short-term exposure tests (hours or days) and generally use lethality as an endpoint. In acute exposures, organisms come into contact with higher doses of the toxicant in a single event or in multiple events over a short period of time and usually produce immediate effects, depending on absorption time of the toxicant. These tests are generally conducted on organisms during a specific time period of the organism’s life cycle, and are considered partial life cycle tests. Acute tests are not valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 10%&lt;!-- This is misleading because the control acceptability criterion is dependent on the species and the test duration. It is true that &lt;/= 10% is the criterion for many short term acute tests. However, in a 96-hour water test with ''Hyalella azteca'', while the test is not valid if mortality is greater than 10%, the acceptability for a 14-day sediment exposure (survival and growth) which is not deemed to be a chronic test (the 42-day survival reproduction test is chronic) is &lt;/= 20%. The 10-day ''Chironomus dilutus'' test in sediment currently has an acceptability criterion of &lt;/= 30% although as people's experience with this organism has improved, it has been found that most labs consistently obtain much better survival than this. --&gt;. Results are reported in EC50, or concentration that will affect fifty percent of the sample size.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

'''Chronic''' tests are long-term tests (weeks, months years), relative to the test organism’s life span (&gt;10% of life span), and generally use sub-lethal endpoints. In chronic exposures, organisms come into contact with low, continuous doses of a toxicant.  Chronic exposures may induce effects to acute exposure, but can also result in effects that develop slowly. Chronic tests are generally considered full life cycle tests and cover an entire generation time or reproductive life cycle (“egg to egg”). Chronic tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 20%. These results are generally reported in NOECs (No observed effects level) and LOECs (Lowest observed effects level)&lt;!-- The practice of reporting NOECs and LOECs is becoming less common since these endpoints are dependent on the concentration series chosen. For example, if the effect occurs at 2% and the concentration series chosen for testing is 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25, the NOEC reported would be 6.25 instead of 2%.  There is considerable debate about this in the toxicity testing community but LC/EC/IC data is considerably more powerful. --&gt;.

Early life stage tests are considered as subchronic exposures that are less than a complete reproductive life cycle and include exposure during early, sensitive life stages of an organism. These exposures are also called critical life stage, embryo-larval, or egg-fry tests. Early life stage tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 30%.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

Short-term sublethal tests are used to evaluate the toxicity of effluents to aquatic organisms. These methods are developed by the EPA, and only focus on the most sensitive life stages. Endpoints for these test include changes in growth, reproduction and survival. NOECs, LOECs and EC50s are reported in these tests.

'''Bioaccumulation''' tests are toxicity tests that can be used for [[hydrophobic]] chemicals that may accumulated in the fatty tissue of aquatic organisms. Toxicants with low solubilities in water generally can be stored in the fatty tissue due to the high lipid content in this tissue. The storage of these toxicants within the organism may lead to cumulative toxicity. Bioaccumulation tests use bioconcentration factors (BCF) to predict concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants in organisms. The BCF is the ratio of the average concentration of test chemical accumulated in the tissue of the test organism (under steady state conditions) to the average measured concentration in the water.

Freshwater tests and saltwater tests have different standard methods, especially as set by the regulatory agencies. However, these tests generally include a control (negative and/or positive), a geometric dilution series or other appropriate logarithmic dilution series, test chambers and equal numbers of replicates, and a test organism. Exact exposure time and test duration will depend on type of test (acute vs. chronic) and organism type. Temperature, water quality parameters and light will depend on regulator requirements and organism type.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

In the US, many wastewater dischargers (e.g., factories, power plants, [[refineries]], mines, municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants) are required to conduct periodic '''whole effluent toxicity''' (WET) tests under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, pursuant to the [[Clean Water Act]]. For facilities discharging to freshwater, effluent is used to perform static-acute multi-concentration toxicity tests with ''[[Ceriodaphnia dubia]]'' (water flea) and ''[[Pimephales promelas]]'' (fathead minnow), among other species. The test organisms are exposed for 48 hours under static conditions with five concentrations of the effluent. The major deviation in the short-term chronic effluent toxicity tests and the acute effluent toxicity tests is that the short-term chronic test lasts for seven days and the acute test lasts for 48 hours. For discharges to marine and estuarine waters, the test species used are  [[sheepshead minnow]] (''Cyprinodon variegatus''), [[inland silverside]] (''Menidia beryllina''), ''[[Americamysis bahia]]'', and [[purple sea urchin]] (''Strongylocentrotus purpuratus'').&lt;ref name="WET"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/whole-effluent-toxicity-wet |title=Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-10-10 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WET-methods"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/whole-effluent-toxicity-methods |title=Whole Effluent Toxicity Methods |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-04-19 |website=Clean Water Act Analytical Methods |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sediment tests===
At some point most chemicals originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources accumulate in sediment. For this reason, sediment toxicity can play a major role in the adverse biological effects seen in aquatic organisms, especially those inhabiting benthic habitats. A recommended approach for sediment testing is to apply the Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) which involves simultaneously examining sediment chemistry, toxicity, and field alterations so that more complete information can be gathered&lt;!-- This sediment quality triad has now been expanded to include not just sediment chemistry, toxicity, and field alterations but also bioaccumulation/bioavailability assessments using either laboratory tests or measuring the contaminants in the tissues of native organisms collected at the site.  The term now used more frequently is "sediment assessment framework". For example see http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/ec/En164-14-2007-eng.pdf --&gt;. Collection, handling, and storage of sediment can have an effect on bioavailability and for this reason standard methods have been developed to suit this purpose.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

==Toxicological effects==
[[Toxicity]] can be broken down into two broad categories of direct and indirect toxicity. Direct toxicity results from a toxicant acting at the site of action in or on the organism. Indirect toxicity occurs with a change in the physical, chemical, or biological environment.
 
[[Lethality]] is most common effect used in toxicology and used as an endpoint for acute toxicity tests. While conducting chronic toxicity tests [[sublethal]] effects are endpoints that are looked at. These endpoints include behavioral, physiological, biochemical, histological changes.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;
 
There are a number of effects that occur when an organism is simultaneously exposed to two or more toxicants. These effects include additive effects, [[synergistic]] effects, [[potentiation]] effects, and [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]] effects. An additive effect occurs when combined effect is equal to a combination or sum of the individual effects. A synergistic effect occurs when the combination of effects is much greater than the two individual effects added together. Potentiation is an effect that occurs when an individual chemical has no effect is added to a toxicant and the combination has a greater effect than just the toxicant alone. Finally, an antagonistic effect occurs when a combination of chemicals has less of an effect than the sum of their individual effects.&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt;

*[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) – A forum for governments to work together to promote policies for the betterment of people’s social and economic well-being around the world. One way in which they accomplish this is through the development of aquatic toxicity test guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/pages/0,3417,en_36734052_36734103_1_1_1_1_1,00.html "About the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)"] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Retrieved 2012-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
*Median Lethal Concentration ([[LC50]]) – The chemical concentration that is expected to kill 50% of a group of organisms.
*Median Effective Concentration ([[EC50]]) – The chemical concentration that is expected to have one or more specified effects in 50% of a group of organisms.&lt;!-- Median Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) is another term used.  It is the concentration that is expected to cause inhibition of species biological endpoints (e.g. enzyme production, cellular division, growth, reproduction).  It should also be noted that sometimes more protective endpoints are desired and so EC25, or IC10 for example can be calculated to determine the concentration that will affect 25% or 10% of the group. --&gt;
*Critical [[Body burden|Body Residue]] (CBR) – An approach that routinely examines whole-body chemical concentrations of an exposed organism that is associated with an adverse biological response.
*Baseline toxicity – Refers to narcosis which is a depression in biological activity due to toxicants being present in the organism.
*[[Biomagnification]] – The process by which the concentration of a chemical in the tissues of an organism increases as it passes through several levels in the food web.
*Lowest Observed Effect Concentration (LOEC) – The lowest test concentration that has a statistically significant effect over a specified exposure time.
*No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) – The highest test concentration for which no effect is observed relative to a control over a specified exposure time.
*[[Maximum acceptable toxicant concentration|Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) – An estimated value that represents the highest “no-effect” concentration of a specific substance within the range including the NOEC and LOEC.
*Application Factor (AF) – An empirically derived “safe” concentration of a chemical.
*[[Biomonitoring]] – The consistent use of living organisms to analyze environmental changes over time.
*[[Effluent]] – Liquid, industrial discharge that usually contain varying chemical toxicants.
*[[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]] (QSAR) – A method of modeling the relationship between biological activity and the structure of organic chemicals.
*[[Mode of action|Mode of Action]] – A set of common behavioral or physiological signs that represent a type of adverse response. 
*Mechanism of Action – The detailed events that take place at the molecular level during an adverse biological response.
*KOW – The [[octanol]]-water [[partition coefficient]] which represents the ratio of the concentration of octanol to the concentration of chemical in the water.
*[[Bioconcentration Factor]] (BCF) – The ratio of the average chemical concentration in the tissues of the organism under steady-state conditions to the average chemical concentration measured in the water to which the organisms are exposed.&lt;!-- Biota-sediment accumulation factor is the ratio of a substance’s concentration in the tissue of an aquatic organism to its concentration in the sediment.  For organic contaminants, concentrations are normalized for lipid content and total organic carbon for tissue and sediment, respectively. --&gt;

All terms were derived from Rand.&lt;ref name="Rand" /&gt;

==Significance in regulatory context==
In the United States, aquatic toxicology plays an important role in the [[NPDES]] wastewater permit program. While most wastewater dischargers typically conduct [[analytical chemistry]] testing for known [[pollutant]]s, whole effluent toxicity tests have been standardized and are performed routinely as a tool for evaluating the potential harmful effects of other pollutants not specifically regulated in the discharge permits.&lt;ref name="WET"/&gt;

EPA's water quality program has published water quality criteria (for individual pollutants) and water quality standards (for water bodies) that were derived from aquatic toxicity tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1985 |title=Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses |url=https://www.epa.gov/wqc/guidelines-deriving-numerical-national-water-quality-criteria-protection-aquatic-organisms-and |publisher=EPA |id=PB85-227049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sediment quality guidelines===
While sediment quality guidelines are not meant for regulation, they provide a way to rank and compare sediment quality developed by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]](NOAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/publications/sqg.pdf "Sediment Quality Guidelines developed for the National Status and Trends Program"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612211939/http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/publications/sqg.pdf |date=June 12, 2013 }} National Status &amp; Trends, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; These sediment quality guidelines are summarized in NOAA's Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRT) for many different chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/SQuiRTs.pdf "SQuiRT"] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bellairs Research Institute''', located on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Barbados]], was founded in 1954 as a field-station for [[McGill University]]. Initial funding was from a bequest by British naval commander, [[Carlyon Bellairs]], for whom the institute is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the archives - Bellairs Research Institute|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/bellairs/archives|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellairs is located in [[Holetown]], next to Folkestone Marine Park and Museum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbados.org/folkstone.htm Barbados.org ''Folkestone Marine Park'']&lt;/ref&gt; on the western beach of the island.

Initially founded as a [[marine biology]] field station, it is also currently used for undergraduates to partake in a Barbados Field Study Semester (BFSS). Environmental Engineering, International Development Studies and Environmental Studies are some of the areas it caters to.

Bellairs runs numerous McGill University field-courses and workshops throughout the year, including Applied Tropical Ecology, Geography, and the Barbados Field Study Semester. Bellairs also holds annual field courses from other universities from around the world including the [[University of Toronto|University of Toronto (marine biology)]] and [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan University (archeology)]].

Bellairs participated in testing McGill University's [[AQUA project]] – the world's first robot capable of walking and swimming underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquarobot.net:8080/AQUA/index_html|title=AQUA Project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005062929/http://www.aquarobot.net:8080/AQUA/index_html|archivedate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of [[McGill University]] is in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.

[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Tanner stages]] of breast development in girls.]]

'''Breast development''', also known as '''mammogenesis''', is a complex [[biological process]] in [[primate]]s that takes place throughout a [[female|female's]] life. It occurs across several phases, including [[prenatal development]], [[puberty]], and [[pregnancy]]. At [[menopause]], breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as [[breast]]s in primates, which serve as both a [[sexual characteristic]] and as [[mammary gland]]s. The process is mediated by an assortment of [[hormone]]s (and [[growth factor]]s), the most important of which include [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[prolactin]], and [[growth hormone]].

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|upright=1.36|The breast: cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]. {{ordered list |[[Chest wall]] |[[Pectoralis muscle]]s |[[Lobules]] |[[Nipple]] |[[Areola]] |[[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] |[[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] |[[Human skin|Skin]]}}]]

===Hormones===
The master regulators of breast development are the [[steroid hormone]]s, [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]], growth hormone (GH), mostly via its secretory product, [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), and [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name="pmid20554705"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Hynes NE, Watson CJ |title = Mammary Gland Growth Factors: Roles In Normal Development And In Cancer |journal = Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume = 2 |issue = 8 |pages = a003186 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20554705 |pmc = 2908768 |doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003186 |url = }}[https://www.lustaci.com/best-breast-enhancement-pills/]&lt;/ref&gt; These regulators induce the expression of [[growth factor]]s, such as [[amphiregulin]], [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), IGF-1, and [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF), which in turn have specific roles in breast growth and maturation.&lt;ref name="pmid20554705" /&gt;

At [[puberty]], [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) begins to be secreted, in a [[pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] manner, from the [[hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="JatoiKaufmann2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Ismail Jatoi |author2 = Manfred Kaufmann |title = Management of Breast Diseases |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUBW3-qJ9MC&amp;pg=PA12 |date = 11 February 2010 |publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn = 978-3-540-69743-5 |pages = 12, 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RosenthalZenilman2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Ronnie Ann Rosenthal |author2 = Michael E.

COX-2 expression has been positively associated with breast volume and [[inflammation]] in breast tissue, as well as with breast cancer risk and prognosis.&lt;ref name="pmid24599585" /&gt;

===Rare mutations===
Women with CAIS, who are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated actions of androgens, have, as a group, above-average sized breasts. This is true despite the fact that they simultaneously have relatively low levels of estrogen, which demonstrates the powerful suppressant effect of androgens on estrogen-mediated breast development.&lt;ref name="IIIBarbieri2013" /&gt;

[[Aromatase excess syndrome]], an extremely rare condition characterized by marked [[hyperestrogenism]], is associated with precocious breast development and macromastia in females and similarly precocious [[gynecomastia]] (women's breasts) in males.&lt;ref name="pmid12843139"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Martin RM, Lin CJ, Nishi MY |title = Familial hyperestrogenism in both sexes: clinical, hormonal, and molecular studies of two siblings |journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume = 88 |issue = 7 |pages = 3027–34 |date = July 2003 |pmid = 12843139 |doi = 10.1210/jc.2002-021780 |url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12843139 |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9543166"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Stratakis CA, Vottero A, Brodie A |title = The aromatase excess syndrome is associated with feminization of both sexes and autosomal dominant transmission of aberrant P450 aromatase gene transcription |journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume = 83 |issue = 4 |pages = 1348–57 |date = April 1998 |pmid = 9543166 |doi = 10.1210/jc.83.4.1348 |url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9543166 |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Makowski2011"&gt;{{cite book |author = Gregory Makowski |title = Advances in Clinical Chemistry |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u_ksaKq95jkC&amp;pg=PT158 |accessdate = 24 May 2012 |date = 22 April 2011 |publisher = Academic Press |isbn = 978-0-12-387025-4 |page = 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition in which the AR is defective and insensitive to androgens, there is full breast development with breast volumes that are in fact above average in spite of relatively low levels of estrogen (50 pg/mL estradiol).&lt;ref name="IIIBarbieri2013" /&gt; In [[aromatase deficiency]], a form of [[hypoestrogenism]] in which aromatase is defective and cannot synthesize estrogen, and in complete [[estrogen insensitivity syndrome]], a condition in which ERα is defective and insensitive to estrogen, breast development is completely absent.&lt;ref name="DianePublishing"&gt;{{cite book |title = International position paper on women's health and menopause : a comprehensive approach |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NCzYsz6Uv0IC&amp;pg=PA78 |publisher = DIANE Publishing |isbn = 978-1-4289-0521-4 |pages = 78– }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesonGroot2015"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = J.

==Commonalities==
Despite cultural and regional differences in the interpretations of texts about the life of [[Gautama Buddha]], there are some general guidelines to the attributes of a Buddharupa:
*Fingers and toes are elongated proportionately
*Long, aquiline nose
*Elongated earlobes
*Head protuberance
*Broad shoulders

The elongated earlobes are vestiges of his life as a prince, when he wore extravagant jewelry. The bump at the top of the head is the [[ushnisha]] and represents spirituality, wisdom, and awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|title=Iconography of the Buddha|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/iconography-of-the-buddha/|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
{{further|Buddhist art}}
Depictions of the Buddha vary widely across cultures.

===Proportions===
The image of Buddhas started to emerge from the first century CE in [[North India]], developed in [[Gandhara]] and [[Mathura]]. The art of Gandhara was influenced by [[Ancient Greek art]], leading to the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] with anatomically well-proportioned and realistic figure of the Buddha. One of the most influential Buddhist art was [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and the later [[Amaravati mandal, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]] style. From India the depiction of Buddha spread to the rest of Asia. The Buddharupas of India, Sri Lanka, Javanese [[Borobudur|Sailendra]] and [[Cambodian art]] usually depict a well-proportioned figure, but sometimes he is shown emaciated, in recollection of the Buddha's years of ascetic practices. Japanese buddharupas are often very square and stolid while Indian and Southeast Asian ones often have thinner figures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Many people may be familiar with the "Happy" or "Laughing" Buddha, a different historical figure, who should not be confused with the images of Gautama Buddha. [[Budai]], a Chinese Buddhist monk also known as ''Hotei'', is depicted as fat and happy, almost always shown smiling or laughing, and is associated with [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha.

===Postures, gestures and artefacts===
Images of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sometimes show him reclining, recalling the Buddha Shakyamuni's departure into final nirvana.

Other times he is holding various symbolic objects, or making symbolic [[mudra]]s (gestures).

The clothing also varies; in China and Japan, where it is considered socially improper for monks and nuns to expose the upper arm, the Buddharupa has a tunic and long sleeves, much like the traditional monks and nuns, while in India they are often topless. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6558">'''Careers advisory services''' in the UK are typically organisations that offer advice, guidance and counselling on careers. People may use these services for a number of purposes, such as jobhunting, changing careers, getting a promotion, building career skills, returning to work after a career break and professional development. [[Career]] challenges such as these occur for many reasons, including redundancy, motherhood, leaving full-time education, relocation, or simply coming to the end of a work contract.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Houghton Finding Square Holes: Discover Who You Really Are and Find the Perfect Career&lt;/ref&gt; 

These services usually employ professional career counsellors, coaches and guides to mentor their clients. In the UK, such professionals might have qualifications from institutes such as the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]] (CIPD), International Coach Federation (ICF) and the [[British Psychology Society]] (BPS). The [[Global Career Development Facilitator]] is an international certificate held by about 17.500 people (2010) in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Taiwan, Germany, Romania, Turkey, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cce-global.org/GCDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The Educational and Vocational Guidance Practitioner (EVGP) is a credential of the International Association for Educational and Vocational Guidance (IAEVG) based on competency inventory. The EVGP is administered and awarded on behalf of the IAEVG by the Center of Credentialing and Education in Greensboro, North Carolina, in the United States, which is an affiliate subsidiary of the American National Board of Certified Counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502190405/http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |archivedate=2015-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest examples of a governmental careers advisory service in the UK came as a result of The Education (Choice of Employment) Act (1910). This gave local education authorities the opportunity to advise juveniles on getting work. Each education authority had an officer who was assigned the specific role of advising juveniles in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. David Peck Careers Services: History, Policy and Practice in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of careers advisory services==
The UK government’s careers advisory service is called [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx The National Careers Service]. Most UK universities also have their own in-house careers advisory services for students and alumni. A number of corporate entities also have in-house careers advisory services for their employees. There are privately owned, independent careers advisory services throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Watts et al: Rethinking Careers Education and Guidance: Theory Policy and Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing careers advisory services==
Traditionally, clients of careers advisory services have met up with their [[career guide]]/counsellor/coach face-to-face to work through their career challenges. Nowadays, however, careers advisory services may offer remote channels of communication such as careers telephone lines and online tools.&lt;ref&gt;AG Watts &amp; Gareth Dent "Let your Fingers do the Walking": the Use of Telephone Helplines in Career Information and Guidance, {{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040710120052/http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now private companies that are offering subscription-based online careers information, advice and guidance to schools across the UK. Some careers advisory services also go out into the community by running seminars and workshops.

==Methods and tools==
Careers advisory services adopt many different techniques and tools to assist their clients. They include such things as: diagnostic tests and questionnaires; personality assessments; CV writing workshops; [[mock interview]]s;'career drivers' questionnaires and visionboards. An established career coaching technique used by many careers advisers is a combination of the [[GROW_model|GROW]] model and the 'solution-focused' methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Erik de Haan &amp; Yvonne Burger: Coaching with colleagues: an action guide to one-to-one learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, B; Palmer, S. (2003), Introduction to the Solution-Focused Approach, Sage. London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and guidelines==
In the UK, careers advisory services must adhere to British Guidance Council Quality Standards by meeting criteria consisting of several detailed competencies. The performance of staff within these services is also keenly observed by these standards. Further standards and guidelines concentrate on quality of informational material, such as books, manuals and commercial PDFs, as well as learning and delivery outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Plant: Quality in Careers Guidance, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/47/2698228.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
People in the Republic of Ireland can find careers advisory services through organisations such as the FAS-Irish National Training and Employment Authority. In Northern Ireland, careers guidance services are delivered by the Northern Ireland Careers Service and Educational Guidance Service for Adults.

CEC affects many aspects of soil chemistry, and is used as a measure of soil [[fertility (soil)|fertility]], as it indicates the capacity of the soil to retain several nutrients (e.g. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in plant-available form. It also indicates the capacity to retain pollutant cations (e.g. Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Definition and principles==
[[File:CEC concept.svg|thumb|Cation exchange at the surface of a soil particle]]Cation-exchange capacity is defined as the amount of positive charge that can be exchanged per mass of soil, usually measured in cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg. Some texts use the older, equivalent units me/100g or meq/100g. CEC is measured in [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s of electric charge, so a cation exchange capacity of 10 cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg could hold 10 cmol of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations (with 1 unit of charge per cation) per kilogram of soil, but only 5 cmol Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (2 units of charge per cation).&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt;
Cation-exchange capacity arises from various negative charges on soil particle surfaces, especially those of [[clay minerals]] and [[soil organic matter]]. [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|Phyllosilicate]] clays consist of layered sheets of aluminium and silicon [[oxides]]. The replacement of aluminium or silicon atoms by other elements with lower charge (e.g. Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaced by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) can give the clay structure a net negative charge.&lt;ref name = Birkeland/&gt; This charge does not involve deprotonation and is therefore [[pH]]-independent, and called permanent charge.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; In addition, the edges of these sheets expose many acidic [[hydroxyl]] groups that are deprotonated to leave negative charges at the pH levels in many soils. Organic matter also makes a very significant contribution to cation exchange, due to its large number of charged [[functional groups]]. CEC is typically higher near the soil surface, where organic matter content is highest, and declines with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Böden der Welt | year = 2014 | edition = 2nd | last1 = Zech | first1 = Wolfgang | last2 = Schad | first2 = Peter | last3 = Hintermeier-Erhard | first3 = Gerd | publisher = Springer Spektrum | location = Berlin | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEC of organic matter is highly pH-dependent.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt;

Cations are adsorbed to soil surfaces by the electrostatic interaction between their positive charge and the negative charge of the surface, but they retain a shell of water molecules and do not form direct chemical bonds with the surface.&lt;ref name = Schaetzl&gt;{{cite book | title = Soils: Genesis and geomorphology | year = 2015 | edition = 2nd | last1 = Schaetzl | first1 = Randall J. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Michael L. | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exchangeable cations thus form part of the [[Double layer (surface science)|diffuse layer]] above the charged surface. The binding is relatively weak, and a cation can easily be displaced from the surface by other cations from the surrounding solution.

==[[Soil pH]]==
[[File:CEC pH.svg|thumb|Effect of soil pH on cation exchange capacity]]
The amount of negative charge from deprotonation of clay hydroxy groups or organic matter depends on the pH of the surrounding solution. Increasing the pH (i.e. decreasing the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations) increases this variable charge, and therefore also increases the cation exchange capacity.

==Measurement==
[[File:CEC measurement principle.svg|thumb|Principle of CEC measurement in soil]]Cation-exchange capacity is measured by displacing all the bound cations with a concentrated solution of another cation, and then measuring either the displaced cations or the amount of added cation that is retained.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; Barium (Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are frequently used as exchanger cations, although many other methods are available.&lt;ref name = Schaetzl/&gt;&lt;ref name = Pansu&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Soil Analysis | year = 2006 | last1 = Pansu | first1 = Marc | last2 = Gautheyrou | first2 = Jacques| publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | pages = 709–754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CEC measurements depend on pH, and therefore are often made with a [[buffer solution]] at a particular pH value. If this pH differs from the natural pH of the soil, the measurement will not reflect the true CEC under normal conditions. Such CEC measurements are called "potential CEC". Alternatively, measurement at the native soil pH is termed "effective CEC", which more closely reflects the real value, but can make direct comparison between soils more difficult.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt;&lt;ref name = Pansu/&gt;

==Typical values==
The cation exchange capacity of a soil is determined by its constituent materials, which can vary greatly in their individual CEC values. CEC is therefore dependent on parent materials from which the soil developed, and the conditions under which it developed. These factors are also important for determining soil pH, which has a major influence on CEC.

==Base saturation==
Base saturation expresses the percentage of potential CEC occupied by the cations Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt;&lt;ref name = Schaetzl/&gt; These are traditionally termed "base cations" because they are non-acidic, although they are not [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s in the usual chemical sense.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; Base saturation provides an index of soil weathering&lt;ref name = Schaetzl/&gt; and reflects the availability of exchangeable cationic nutrients to plants.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt;

==Anion exchange capacity==
Positive charges of soil minerals can retain anions by the same principle as cation exchange. The surfaces of kaolinite, [[allophane]] and iron and aluminium oxides often carry positive charges.&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; In most soils the cation exchange capacity is much greater than the anion exchange capacity, but the opposite can occur in highly weathered soils,&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; such as [[ferralsols]] ([[oxisols]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Cognized environment''' is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, [[Roy Rappaport]] (1968), in contrast to what he called the ''operational environment'' (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  – say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans – with how the people’s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) – say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport’s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.

Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport’s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of [[neuroanthropology]] called [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body’s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14846">'''Common coding theory''' is a [[cognitive psychology]] theory describing how perceptual representations (e.g. of things we can see and hear) and motor representations (e.g. of hand actions) are linked.  The theory claims that there is a shared representation (a common code) for both perception and action.  More important, seeing an event activates the action associated with that event, and performing an action activates the associated perceptual event.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, W. (1984). Modes of linkage between perception and action. In W. Prinz &amp; A.-F. Sanders (Eds.), Cognition and motor processes (pp. 185-193). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of direct perception-action links originates in the work of the American psychologist [[William James]] and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner [[Roger Sperry]].  Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R.W. | year = 1952 | title = Neurology and the mind-body problem | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 291–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: [[perception]] is a means to action and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is a means to perception.  Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.

==Background==
The classical approach to cognition is a 'sandwich' model which assumes three stages of information processing: [[perception]], [[cognition]] and then [[Action (philosophy)|action]].  In this model, perception and action do not interact directly, instead cognitive processing is needed to convert perceptual representations into action.  For example, this might require creating arbitrary linkages (mapping between sensory and motor codes).&lt;ref&gt;Massaro, D. W. (1990). An information-processing analysis of perception and action. In O. Neumann &amp; W. Prinz (Eds.), Relationships between perception and action: Current approaches (pp. 133-166). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the common coding account claims that perception and action are directly linked by a common computational code.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, W. (2005). Experimental approaches to action. In J. Roessler and N. Eilan (Eds.), Agency and self-awareness (pp. 165-187). New-York, Oxford University press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory, put forward by German scientist [[Wolfgang Prinz]] and his colleagues from the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences]], claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W | year = 1997 | title = Perception and action planning | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1080/713752551}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory also states that [[perception]] of an [[Action (philosophy)|action]] should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knoblich | first1 = G. | last2 = Flach | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 467–472 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a claim suggests that we represent observed, executed and imagined actions in a commensurate manner and makes specific predictions regarding the nature of action and perceptual representations.  First, representations for observed and executed actions should rely on a shared neural substrate.  Second, a common cognitive system predicts facilitation of action based on directly prior perception and vice versa. Third, such a system predicts interference effects when action and perception attempt to access shared representations simultaneously.

==Evidence for common coding==
In the past decade, a growing number of results have been interpreted in favor of the common coding theory.

For instance, one functional MRI study demonstrated that the brain's response to the 2/3 power law of motion (i.e., which dictates a strong coupling between movement curvature and velocity) is much stronger and more widespread than to other types of motion. Compliance with this law was reflected in the activation of a large network of brain areas subserving motor production, visual motion processing, and action observation functions. These results support the common coding and the notion of similar neural coding for motion perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eran Dayan | first1 = E. | last2 = Casile | first2 = A. | last3 = Levit-Binnun | first3 = N. | last4 = Giese | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Hendler | first5 = T. | last6 = Flash | first6 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Neural representations of kinematic laws of motion: Evidence for action-perception coupling | journal = PNAS | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 20582–20587 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0710033104 | pmid=18079289 | pmc=2154474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most direct evidence for common coding in the brain now stems from the fact that pattern classifiers that can differentiate based on brain activity whether someone has performed action A or B can also classify, above chance, whether that person heard the sound of action A or B, thereby demonstrating that action execution and perception are represented using a common code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003690| title = Testing Simulation Theory with Cross-Modal Multivariate Classification of fMRI Data| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 3| issue = 11| pages = e3690| year = 2008| last1 = Etzel | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gazzola | first2 = V. | last3 = Keysers | first3 = C. | pmid=18997869 | pmc=2577733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support originates in EEG studies investigating the physiological substrate of perception and action in cognitive tasks. Segregating cortical activity by an [[independent component analysis]] (ICA) consistently reveals component relating to the processing of sensory stimuli and simultaneously to generating appropriate motor responses. This provides evidence for a common code involved in the whole perception-action loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-04757-8| title = EEG correlates of sensorimotor processing: independent components involved in sensory and motor processing| journal = Sci Rep| volume = 7| pages = 4461| year = 2017| last1 = Melnik | first1 = A | last2 = Hairston | first2 = WD | last3 = Ferris | first3 = DP | last4 = König | first4 = P | pmid=28667328 | pmc=5493645}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recently, the common coding theory received increased interest from researchers in developmental psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommerville | first1 = J.

Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Bargh | first2 = J.A. | year = 2001 | title = The perception-behavior expressway: automatic effects of social perception on social behavior | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commensurate representation==
Common coding posits, on top of separate coding, further domains of representation in which afferent and efferent information share the same format and dimensionality of representation. Common coding refers to 'late' afferent representations (referring to events in the environment) and 'early' efferent representations (referring to intended events). Such representations are commensurate since they both exhibit distal reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W | year = 1992 | title = Why don't we perceive our brain states? | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/09541449208406240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hommel | first1 = B. | last2 = Müsseler | first2 = J. | last3 = Aschersleben | first3 = G. | last4 = Prinz | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The theory of event coding (TEC): A framework for perception and action planning | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 849–878 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000103 | pmid=12239891}}&lt;/ref&gt; They permit creating linkages between perception and action that do not rely on arbitrary mappings. Common coding conceives action planning in terms of operations that determine intended future events from given current events (matching between event codes and action codes). In particular perception and action may modulate each other by virtue of similarity. Unlike rule-based mapping of incommensurate codes which requires preceding acquisition of mapping rules, similarity-based matching of commensurate codes requires no such preceding rule acquisition.

==Ideomotor principle==
In line with the ideomotor theory of [[William James]] (1890) and [[Hermann Lotze]] (1852), the  common coding theory posits that actions are represented in terms of their perceptual consequences. Actions are represented like any other events, the sole distinctive feature being that they are (or can be) generated through bodily movements. Perceivable action consequences may vary on two major dimensions: resident vs. remote effects, and 'cool' versus 'hot' outcomes (i.e., reward values associated with action outcomes).&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, A., &amp; Balleine, B. W. (2002). The role of learning in the operation of motivational systems. In H. Pashler &amp; R. Gallistel (Eds.), Stevens' handbook of experimental psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 497-533). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals perform actions they learn what their movements lead to (Ideomotor learning). The ideomotor theory claims that these associations can also be used in the reverse order (cf. William James, 1890 II, p.&amp;nbsp;526): When individuals perceive events of which they know (from previous learning) that they may result from certain movements, perception of these events may evoke the movements leading to them (Ideomotor control). The distinction between learning and control is equivalent to the distinction between forward and inverse computation in motor learning and control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wolpert|Wolpert, D.]], &amp; [[Zoubin Ghahramani|Ghahramani, Z.]] (2004). Computational motor control. In M. S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), The cognitive neurosciences (3 ed., pp. 485-494). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideomotor learning supports prediction and anticipation of action outcomes, given current action. Ideomotor control supports selection and control of action, given intended outcomes.

==Related approaches==
While most traditional approaches tend to stress the relative independence of perception and action, some theories have argued for closer links. [[Motor theory of speech perception|Motor theories of speech]] and action perception have made a case for motor contributions to perception.&lt;ref&gt;Viviani, P. (2002). Motor competence in the perception of dynamic events: A tutorial. In W. Prinz &amp; B. Hommel (Eds.), Common mechanisms in perception and action: Attention and  Performance (Vol. XIX, pp. 406-442). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = A. M. | year = 1982 | title = On finding that speech is special | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 148–167 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close non-representational connections between perception and action have also been claimed by ecological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, C. A., &amp; Turvey, M. T. (1982). Observational perspective and descriptive level in perceiving and acting. In W. B. Weimer &amp; D. S. Palermo (Eds.), Cognition and the symbolic processes (Vol. 2, pp. 1-19). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. J. (1979). The ecological approach to visual perception.

Today common coding theory is closely related to research and theory in two intersecting fields of study: [[Mirror neurons]] systems and embodied cognition. As concerns mirror systems, common coding seems to reflect the functional logic of mirror neurons and mechanisms in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Craighero | first2 = L. | year = 2004 | title = The mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid=15217330}}&lt;/ref&gt; As concerns embodied cognition, common coding is compatible with the claim that meaning is embodied, i.e. grounded in perception and action.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, A.

'''[[Community]] psychology''' studies the individuals' contexts within communities and the wider society,&lt;ref name="JimOrford"&gt;Jim Orford, ''Community Psychology: Challenges, Controversies and Emerging Consensus'', John Wiley and Sons, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships of the individual to communities and society. Community psychologists seek to understand the quality of life of individuals within groups, organizations and institutions, communities, and society. Their aim is to enhance quality of life through collaborative research and action.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01&gt;Dalton, J.H., Elias, M.J., &amp; Wandersman, A. (2001). "Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities." Stamford, CT: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community psychology employs various perspectives within and outside [[psychology]] to address issues of communities, the relationships within them, and related people's attitudes and behaviour.

Rappaport (1977) discusses the perspective of community psychology as an ecological perspective on the person–environment fit (this is often related to work environments) being the focus of study and action instead of attempting to change the personality of individual or the environment when an individual is seen as having a problem.&lt;ref name=Rappaport77&gt;Rappaport, J. (1977). "Community Psychology: Values, Research, &amp; Action." New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related disciplines include [[ecological psychology]], [[environmental psychology]], [[critical psychology]], [[cross-cultural psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[political science]], [[public health]], [[sociology]], [[social work]], [[applied anthropology]], and [[community development]].&lt;ref name=Maton06&gt;Maton, K.

Community psychology grew out of the [[community mental health]] movement, but evolved dramatically as early practitioners incorporated their understandings of political structures and other community contexts into perspectives on client services.&lt;ref name=Levine97&gt;Levine, M., &amp; Perkins, D.V.

== Society for Community Research and Action ==
{{Community}}

Division 27 of the [[American Psychological Association]] is the community psychology division of the APA, called the [http://scra27.org Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA).] The Society's mission is as follows:
{{quote|text=The Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA) is an international organization devoted to advancing theory, research, and social action. Its members are committed to promoting health and empowerment and to preventing problems in communities, groups, and individuals. SCRA serves many different disciplines that focus on community research and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scra27.org/ Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA)]. Division 27 of the American Psychological Association. Retrieved on: February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The SCRA website has resources for teaching and learning community psychology, information on events in the field and related to research and action, how to become involved and additional information on the field, members and undergraduate and graduate programs in community psychology.

==History of community psychology in the US==
In the 1950s and 1960s, many factors contributed to the beginning of community psychology in the US. Some of these factors include:
* A shift away from socially conservative, individual-focused practices in health care and psychology into a progressive period concerned with issues of public health, prevention and social change after [[World War II]]&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt; and social psychologists' growing interest in racial and religious prejudice, poverty, and other social issues &lt;ref&gt;Levine, M., Perkins, D.D., &amp;  Perkins, D.V. (2005). Principles of community psychology: Perspectives and Applications (3rd Edition). New York: Oxford University Press. (p. 64-69)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The perceived need of larger-scale mental illness treatment for veterans&lt;ref name=Rappaport77/&gt;
* Psychologists questioning the value of [[psychotherapy]] alone in treating large numbers of people with mental illness&lt;ref name=Rappaport77/&gt;
* The development of community mental health centers and deinstitutionalization of people with mental illnesses into their communities&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;

===Swampscott Conference===
In 1965, several psychologists met to discuss the future of community mental health as well as discuss the issue of only being involved with problems of mental health instead of the community as a whole. The Swampscott Conference is considered the birthplace of community psychology. A published report on the conference calls for community psychologists to be political activists, agents of social change and "participant-conceptualizers."&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;

==Theories, concepts and values in community psychology==

===Ecological levels of analysis===
James Kelly (1966; Trickett, 1984) developed an ecological analogy used to understand the ways in which settings and individuals are interrelated. Unlike the ecological framework developed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner|Bronfenbrenner]] (1979), the focus of Kelly's framework was not so much on how different levels of the environment may impact on the individual, but on understanding how human communities function. Specifically, Kelly suggests that there are 4 important principles that govern people in settings:  
* '''adaptation''': i.e. that what individuals do is adaptive given the demands of the surrounding context. It is a two-way process: Individuals adapt to the restrictions, constraints, and quality of the environment, while the environment adapts to its members &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trickett|first=E.J|title=Handbook of Community Mental Health|date=1972|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|location=New York|isbn=013377242X|pages=331–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Examples: In regards to adaption of the individual, take for instance when an individual adapts to the demands of a new job, they adapt to that environment by learning or acquiring any necessary skills that they may need to perform their tasks well. On the environmental side of adaption, we can imagine various situations involving the family, such as the birth of a child, new job of a parent, or when children attend college and move away from home; in all of these instances the environment adapted as necessary to the changes in its members &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloos,|first=Brett|title=Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning Products|isbn=1-111-35257-7|pages=142–143|edition=3rd|author2=Hill, Jean |author3=Thomas, Elizabeth |author4=Wandersman, Abraham |author5=Elias, Maurice |author6= Dalton, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''succession''': every setting has a history that created current structures, norms, attitudes, and policies, and any intervention in the setting must appreciate this history and understand why the current system exists in the form that it does. This principle applies to families, organizations, and communities; further, an implication of noting and understanding succession in these units is that psychologists must understand the history of that unit (family, organization, or community) before attempting to implement an intervention plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloos|first=Brett|title=Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-35257-7|pages=143–144|edition=3rd|author2=Hill, Jean |author3=Thomas, Elizabeth |author4=Wandersman, Abraham |author5=Elias, Maurice |author6= Dalton, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''cycling of resources''': each setting has resources that need to be identified and possibilities for new resources to be developed; a resource perspective emphasizes a focus on strengths of individuals, groups, and institutions within the setting and interventions are more likely to succeed if they build on such existing strengths, rather than introduce new external mechanisms for change. There are ''personal resources'' which include individual talents, strengths, or specialties, as well as ''social resources'' such as shared norms, beliefs, or values; further, aspects of the physical environment can be considered resources, such as calm resting places, a library, and other qualities of the space in particular &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloos|first=Brett|title=Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-35257-7|pages=142|edition=3rd|author2=Hill, Jean |author3=Thomas, Elizabeth |author4=Wandersman, Abraham |author5=Elais |author6=Maurice |author7= Dalton, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''interdependence''': settings are systems, and any change to one aspect of the setting will have consequences for other aspects of the setting, so any intervention needs to anticipate its impact across the entire setting, and be prepared for [[unintended consequences]]. When we look at a school, for instance, as a real-world example, the interdependent parts include: students, teachers, administrators, students' parents, faculty and staff (secretaries, janitors, counselors, nurses), board members, and taxpayers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloos|first=Brett|title=Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-35257-7|pages=141–142|edition=3rd|author2=Hill, Jean |author3=Thomas, Elizabeth |author4=Wandersman, Abraham |author5=Elias, Maurice |author6= Dalton, James }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First-order and second-order change===
Because community psychologists often work on social issues, they are often working toward positive [[social change]]. [[Watzlawick]], et al. (1974) differentiated between first-order and second-order change and how second-order change is often the focus of community psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Watzlawick, P., Weakland, J., &amp; Fisch, R. (1974). "Change: Principles of problem formation and problem resolution." New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''first-order change''': positively changing the individuals in a setting to attempt to fix a problem
* '''second-order change''': Attending to systems and structures involved with the problem to adjust the person–environment fit

As an example of how these methods differ, consider homelessness. A first-order change to "fix" homelessness would be to offer shelter to one or many homeless people. A second-order change would be to address issues in policy regarding affordable housing.

===Prevention and health promotion===
Community psychology emphasizes principles and strategies of preventing social, emotional and behavioral problems and wellness and [[health promotion]] at the individual and community levels, borrowed from [[Public health]] and [[Preventive medicine]], rather than a passive, "waiting-mode," treatment-based [[medical model]]. Universal, selective, primary, and indicated or [[secondary prevention]] (early identification and intervention) are particularly emphasized. Community psychology's contributions to [[Prevention Science]] have been substantial, including development and evaluation of the [[Head Start Program]].

===Empowerment===
One of the goals of community psychology involves [[empowerment]] of individuals and communities that have been marginalized by society.

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources" (Cornell Empowerment Group).&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

While empowerment has had an important place in community psychology research and literature, some have criticized its use. Riger (1993), for example, points to the paradoxical nature of empowerment being a masculine, individualistic construct being used in community research.&lt;ref&gt;Riger, S. (1993). What's wrong with empowerment? "American Journal of Community Psychology," 21(3), 279–292&lt;/ref&gt; Community psychologist [[Guy Holmes (psychologist)|Guy Holmes]] critiqued empowerment as a vague concept replete with what [[Wolf Wolfensberger]] has called 'high craze value' i.e. a fashionable term that means different things to different people, and ultimately means everything and nothing. Certainly few community psychologists would agree with [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] that 'power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology in the Real World: Community-based groupwork|last=Holmes|first=G.|publisher=PCCS Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ross-on-Wye|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the support and empowerment paradigm (Racino, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). Table 1.1 A comparison of the rehabilitation, independent living and support paradigms. (p.7) ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. at amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed as an organizing concept to replace or complement the prior rehabilitation paradigm, and to acknowledge the diverse groups and community-based work of the emerging community disciplines.

===Social justice===
A core value of community psychology is seeking [[social justice]] through research and action. Community psychologists are often [[advocacy|advocates]] for equality and policies that allow for the wellbeing of all people, particularly marginalized populations.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;

===Diversity===
Another value of community psychology involves embracing [[multiculturalism|diversity]]. Rappaport includes diversity as a defining aspect of the field, calling research to be done for the benefit of diverse populations in gaining equality and justice. This value is seen through much of the research done with communities regardless of ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability status, socioeconomic status, gender and age.&lt;ref name=Rappaport77/&gt;

===Individual wellness===
Individual wellness is the physical and psychological wellbeing of all people. Research in community psychology focuses on methods to increase individual wellness, particularly through prevention and second-order change.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;

===Citizen participation===
Citizen participation refers to the ability of individuals to have a voice in decision-making, defining and addressing problems, and the dissemination of information gathered on them.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt; This is the basis for the usage of [[participatory action research]] in community psychology, where community members are often involved in the research process by sharing their unique knowledge and experience with the research team and working as co-researchers. In contrast, citizen participation is sought by community developers and community planners (i.e., public administrators) to assure that governmental funds best meet the needs of local citizenry. Three key values of participation are: building support for governmental planning, raising political consciousness, and furthering democratic values.&lt;ref&gt;Wandersman, A. &amp; Florin, P. (1999). Citizen participation and community organizations. (pp. 247-272). In: J. Rappaport &amp; E. Seidman (Eds.), ''Handbook of Community Psychology''. NY, NY: Kluwer Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen participation in policymaking has a long history and has been particular strong in neighborhood action and poverty programs, and other activist-led initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Piven, P. (1972). Participation of resident in neighborhood action programs. (pp. 194-205). In: F. M. Lownberg &amp; R. Dolgoff, ''The Practice of Social Work Intervention''. Itasca, IL: F.E. Peacock Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration and community strengths===
[[Collaboration]] with community members to construct research and action projects makes community psychology an exceptionally applied field. By allowing communities to use their knowledge to contribute to projects in a collaborative, fair and equal manner, the process of research can itself be empowering to citizens. This requires an ongoing relationship between the researcher and the community from before the research begins to after the research is over.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;

===Psychological sense of community===
Psychological sense of community (or simply "[[sense of community]]"), was introduced in 1974 by [[Seymour Sarason]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarason, S.B. (1974). ''The psychological sense of community: Prospects for a community psychology''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 a major step was taken by David McMillan&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, D.W., &amp; Chavis, D.M. (1986). Sense of community: A definition and theory. ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', 14(1), 6–23.&lt;/ref&gt; and David Chavis&lt;ref&gt;Chavis, D.M., &amp; Wandersman, A. (1990). Sense of community in the urban environment: A catalyst for participation and community development. ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', 18(1), 55–81.&lt;/ref&gt; with the publication of their "Theory of Sense of Community" and in 1990 the "Sense of Community Index".&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/Perkins-et-al.1990.Participation-the-social-physical-environment-of-residential-blocks.AJCP_.pdf Perkins, D.D., Florin, P., Rich, R.C., Wandersman, A. &amp; Chavis, D.M. (1990). Participation and the social and physical environment of residential blocks: Crime and community context. ''American Journal of Community Psychology, 18'', 83-115.]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, the Sense of Community Index (SCI) can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the workplace, schools, religious communities, [[community of interest|communities of interest]], etc.

===Empirical grounding===
Community psychology grounds all advocacy and social justice action in empiricism. This [[empirical|empirical grounding]] is what separates community psychology from a social movement or grassroots organization. Methods from psychology have been adapted for use in the field that acknowledge value-driven, subjective research involving community members. The methods used in community psychology are therefore tailored to each individual research question. Quantitative as well as qualitative methods and other innovative methods are embraced.&lt;ref name=Dalton&amp;01/&gt;
The American psychological Association has sponsored two major conferences on community research methods&lt;ref&gt;Tolan, P., Keys, C., Chertok, F., &amp; Jason, L. (Eds.). (1990).  Researching community psychology:  Issues of theories and methods.  Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4318031.aspx http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1990-98742-000/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason, L.A., Keys, C.B., Suarez-Balcazar, Y., Taylor, R.R., Davis, M., Durlak, J., Isenberg, D. (2004). (Eds.). Participatory community research: Theories and methods in action. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association. http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4318003.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and has recently published an edited book on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Jason, L.A., &amp; Glenwick, D.S. (Eds.) (2012). Methodological Approaches to Community-Based Research. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.  http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4316136.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of community and clinical psychology in the UK ==
Community psychology has been differentiated from traditional [[clinical psychology]] as practiced in the UK in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology, Mental Health and Distress|last=Cromby, Harper &amp; Reavey|first=|publisher=Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=|location=Basingstoke|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Education connection===
* [http://www.scra27.org/resources/educationc For information about Education in Community Psychology]

Many programs related to community psychology are housed in psychology departments, while others are interdisciplinary. Students earning a community psychology degree complete courses that focus on: history and concepts of the field, human diversity and cultural competence, public health, community research methods and statistics, collaborative work in communities, organizational and community development and consultation, prevention and intervention, program evaluation, and grantwriting. Research is a large component of both the PhD and master's degrees, as community psychologists base interventions on theory and research and use action-oriented research to promote positive change. Further, students will generally find niches under faculty mentors at their institutions related to local programs, organizations, grants, special populations, or social issues of interest—granting students the chance to have practice doing the work of a community psychologist, under the supervision of a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idealist.org/en/psgerc/commpsych.html Idealist.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Many community psychologists will find clinical psychologists involved in their work in communities, and collaboration between academic departments are encouraged.

'''Cradling''' is a process used in the [[Painting restoration|restoration]] and preservation of [[Panel painting|paintings on wooden panel]]. It consists in mounting a grid of wooden slats to the back of a [[painting]] to create a reinforcement and preserve the flat paint surface.

Slats in either the horizontal or vertical direction are permanently fixed to the back of the panel, whilst the secondary [[perpendicular]] slats remain loose, held solely in place by the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may [[Wood warping|warp]], subject to changing levels of dampness and [[atmospheric pressure]].

This procedure can often be found on [[Old Master]] paintings of the 16th and 17th Century, when painting on wood and particularly oak panel was widely practiced.

There are numerous reasons for choosing to cradle a panel. This can be done to piece back together a painting which has split and cracked over time. It can also be done to consolidate, preserve or straighten back a panel which may have warped.

There are detrimental factors to consider before cradling a painting. It is an  [[Conservation-restoration#Interventive conservation|interventive]] procedure which may involve sanding the back of the panel in order to create a flat surface to affix the cradling. It is a non reversible procedure which alters the condition and state of a work of art, which triggers [[ethical issues]].

With a lot of cradled paintings the sliding cradle members will get stuck due to the movement of the panel. This leads to a lot of tension and cracks in the panel and permanent deformation. Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw. Nowadays, in the modern world of conservation cradling a painting has been outdated and subject to criticism.

Duke University and The University of Brussels have developed an art conservation tool that uses X-rays and algorithms to analyze the paintings. To better image the art piece, for it is of wood sections(cradles) the machine called Platypus or the computer math program sorts out the wood and finely visualizes the original art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/software-helps-art-conservators-clear-cradling|title=Software Helps Art Conservators Clear the Cradling|last=Kowalski|first=Emily|date=2015-09-08|website=Duke University Pratt School of Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Edward Fleming''' is an [[United States|American]] [[biblical scholar]] and [[Assyriologist]] whose work centers on [[Hebrew Bible]] interpretation and [[cultural history]], [[ancient Syria]], [[Emar]], [[Religions of the ancient Near East|ancient religion]], and the interplay of [[ancient Near East]]ern societies.&lt;ref name="ISAW-profile"&gt;[http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/senior-fellows/daniel-fleming-1 Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University Website] Retrieved: 2016-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990, he has served as a professor of [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[ancient Near East|Ancient Near Eastern Studies]] in the [http://hebrewjudaic.as.nyu.edu/page/home Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies] at [[New York University]], where he has spent his whole career.&lt;ref name="ISAW-profile"/&gt;

== Career ==
Fleming received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at [[Stanford University]] in 1979 and his [[Master of Divinity]] from [[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary]] in 1985 before earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] in [http://nelc.fas.harvard.edu Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations] from [[Harvard University]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="ISAW-profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C.V. Academia.edu"&gt;[https://nyu.academia.edu/DFleming/CurriculumVitae Curriculum Vitae, Academia.edu Website] Retrieved: 2017-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his Ph.D., he was immediately appointed to the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="ISAW-profile"/&gt; Fleming is a recipient of the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (2004–05), the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] Fellowship (2004–05), Senior [[Fulbright program|Fulbright Fellowship]] to France (1997–98) and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Summer Stipend (1991).&lt;ref name="World-Bible"&gt;[http://www.theworldofthebible.com/editorial-board/daniel-fleming/ The World of the Bible Editorial Board] Retrieved: 2016-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves as a Senior Fellow for the [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]] at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="ISAW-profile"/&gt; He also serves on the editorial board for ''[[The World of the Bible]]''.&lt;ref name="World-Bible"/&gt;

==Research==
Fleming works broadly in [[ancient near east|ancient Near Eastern]] history, with anchors especially in second-millennium Syria and the first-millennium [[Levant]] as a matrix for [[ancient Israel]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="ISAW-scholar"&gt;[http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/alumni/scholars-2013-2014/daniel-fleming ISAW Scholar] Retrieved: 2016-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; His research involves straddling two separate and sometimes territorial disciplines: [[Assyriology]] and [[biblical studies]]—both defined by written evidence that must be placed in context based on [[archaeology|archaeological]] and visual sources as well.&lt;ref name="ISAW-scholar"/&gt; His framework for treating these domains as part of a whole is ultimately historical, and Fleming's individual projects have probed various aspects of the social fabric and political patterns that characterize the region in broad terms.&lt;ref name="ISAW-scholar"/&gt;

===''The Legacy of Israel in Judah's Bible''===
In his 2012 monograph ''The Legacy of Israel in Judah's Bible: History, Politics, and the Reinscribing of Tradition'', Fleming puts forth a new theory and methodology for Hebrew Bible scholarship: isolating a tentative repertoire of Israelite traditions that can then be compared with external sources of historical evidence.&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3719401/Review_Daniel_Fleming_The_Legacy_of_Israel_in_Judahs_Bible_History_Politics_and_the_Reinscribing_of_Tradition Yitzhak Feder, "Review: Daniel Fleming, The Legacy of Israel in Judah's Bible: History, Politics and the Reinscribing of Tradition"] Retrieved: 2016-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; After letting his theory serve as a catalyst for his doctoral students' research for several years, the publication set a new agenda for future engagement of ancient Israel and Hebrew Bible scholarship with wider study of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Feder"/&gt; According to Fleming, his theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;ultimately attempts to bridge between the worlds of biblical scholarship and archaeologically based history ... It addresses the structure and character of the Bible's primary narrative through [his] vision of a particular relationship between a hodgepodge of lore about early Israel that has been taken over and recast radically by generations of scribes from Judah. This Israelite lore, when considered on its own, presents a picture of ancient Israel that contrasts sufficiently with standard "biblical" schemes as to provoke reevaluation of what the Bible may offer historical investigation. It is [his] hope that by taking ever more seriously the biblical division between what comes from the distinct peoples of Israel and Judah, the character of each will come into sharper relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleming|first1=Daniel|title=The Legacy of Israel in Judah's Bible: History, Politics, and the Reinscribing of Tradition|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781107669994|page=xv}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fleming's work has received advanced praise among senior [[biblical scholars]]. [[David M. Carr]] writes that the monograph is "one of the most important books published in biblical studies in the last decade."&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781107024311 Cambridge University Press Website] Retrieved: 2016-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Finkelstein]] calls the book "a classic—a must for anyone interested in the Bible and the history of Ancient Israel."&lt;ref name="Cam"/&gt; According to [[Mark S. Smith]], Fleming's work "is a superb piece of scholarship," which "no professor or graduate student interested in the Hebrew Bible or ancient Israel can do without."&lt;ref name="Cam"/&gt;

'''''Dishu''''' ({{zh|s=嫡庶|links=no}}) was an important legal and moral system involving marriage and inheritance in ancient [[China]].

In pre-modern eras, upper-class men in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Korea|Korea]] and [[ancient Japan|Japan]] often [[polygyny|had more than one spouse]] to ensure the birth of a male [[heir]] to their assets and titles. In China, a priority system was created to rank the offsprings' entitlement to this inheritance. Under this system, a man was allowed one official wife, called a '''''zhengshi''''' (正室, pronounced ''[[seishitsu]]'' in Japanese, lit. "formal household") or '''''Di'' wife''' (嫡妻), and her son was called the '''''Di'' son''' (嫡子). A woman have to go through a formal wedding to become Di wife, otherwise she would be considered as a concubine of her husband. A man can only have one Di wife, unless he has already divorced with her. In the [[Tang Dynasty]], any man who had more than one ''Di'' wife would be considered to be [[bigamy|bigamous]] and would be liable to one year of [[penal labor]]. The woman involved would also receive a slightly less severe punishment unless she could prove she had been cheated into the marriage.  In either case, the marriage would be [[annul]]led.&lt;ref&gt;《[[Tang Code]]》：“諸有妻更娶妻者，徒一年；女家減一等。若欺妄而娶者，徒一年半；女家不坐。各離之。”&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[concubine|secondary spouse]] was called a '''''ceshi''''' (側室, lit. "side household") or '''''Shu'' wife''' (庶妻). A man only needs a small ritual, or even without any ceremony to have one shu wife. It is allowed to have several Shu wives at the same time according to the law. Shu wife‘s son was called the '''''Shu'' son''' (庶子). Shu sons, have to regard Di wife of their father as their mother and respect her. Their birth mother, would be called '''''yiniang''''' (姨娘, lit. "aunt"). Based on social standards, it is required that Di wife's major responsibilities are managing all Shu wives and taking care of them like her younger sisters. However，if Shu wives do not show respect to Di wife, then Di wife have got right to punish them.

''Di'' sons, regardless of their age, held much higher social status than the ''Shu'' sons, and the eldest ''Di'' son (嫡長子) held the paramount position over all other children of the house.&lt;ref name="DuZheng2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Du|first1=Fangqin|last2=Zheng|first2=Xinrong|title=Women's Studies in China: Mapping the Social, Economic and Policy Changes in Chinese Women's Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uz_F_QLckecC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=978-89-7300-636-6|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[illegitimate child|illegitimate son]], born out of wedlock, was generally categorized as a ''Shu'' son, though he would have much lower status than those born to legitimate ''Shu'' wives.[[Tang dynasty]] law prescribed that if a Di son died, his eldest Di son (Di grandson) should be the successor, taking precedence over all other members of the family; if a Di grandson could not be found, the Di son's next full-brother (born of the same ''zhengshi'' mother) should be the successor. If no Di offspring were available, a Shu son could be considered.&lt;ref&gt;《[[Tang Code]]》：“无嫡子及有罪疾，立嫡孙； 无嫡孙，以次立嫡子同母弟；无母弟，立庶子；无庶子，立嫡孙同母弟；无母弟，立庶孙。曾、玄以下准此。 ”&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the history of [[imperial China]], a man could not divorce  or demote a ''zhengshi'' wife (以妻為妾) unless she had committed one of  "seven misconducts for divorce" (七出).
#[[filial piety|Unfilial conducts]] (不順父母) — considered a sin as it was "immoral" (逆德)
#[[son preference|Incapable of bearing sons]] (無子) — considered a sin as it "threatened bloodlines" (絕世)
#[[Promiscuity]] (淫) — considered a sin as it "disrupted clan" (亂族)
#[[Jealousy]] (妒) — considered a sin as it "disrupted family" (亂家)
#Having [[severe illness]] (有惡疾) — considered a sin as it "hindered family rituals" (不可共粢盛)
#Excessive [[gossip]]ing (口多言) — considered a sin as it "instigated discord among relatives" (離親)
#[[Theft]] (竊盜) — considered a sin as it was "against [[common good]]" (反義)

However, there were three conditions, known as "three exceptions" (三不去), that forbade a man from ever divorcing his wife even if she commits the above seven sins.
#The wife has no parental family to return to after divorce (有所娶無所歸)
#The wife has served three years of [[filial mourning]] for deceased parent(s)-in-law (與更三年喪)
#The husband was poor upon marriage but now wealthy (前貧賤後富貴)

Tang law prescribed that a man caught demoting his ''zhengshi'' wife to ''ceshi'' without good cause would be sentenced to two years of penal labor, and the ''zhengshi'' wife's status would be restored.&lt;ref&gt;《[[Tang Code]]》：“诸以妻为妾，徒二年。各还正之。”&lt;/ref&gt;  Any man who divorced his wife without legitimate reasons (the above-mentioned "seven misconducts") would be subjected to eighteen months of penal labor, and a further 100 strokes of the [[caning|cane]] if he violated the wife's protection under the "three exceptions".&lt;ref&gt;《[[Tang Code]]》：“諸妻無七出及義絕之狀，而出之者，徒一年半；雖犯七出，有三不去，而出之者，杖一百。追還合。若犯惡疾及奸者，不用此律。”&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Song Dynasty]], the difference between social status of Di and Shu wives/sons decreased.

The '''Drake Landing Solar Community''' (DLSC) is a [[planned community]] in [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], equipped with a [[central solar heating]] system and other energy efficient technology. This heating system is the first of its kind in North America, although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe. The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year-round heating by underground [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlsc.ca/ |title=Drake Landing Solar Community |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was designed to model a way of addressing [[global warming]] and the burning of [[fossil fuels]]. The solar energy is captured by 800 [[solar thermal collector]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|title=Case Study: Drake Landing|author=Climate Change Central|accessdate=2007-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516001141/http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located on the roofs of all 52 houses' garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |title=Unique Community a Model for a Greener, Healthier Canada |author=Natural Resources Canada |authorlink=Natural Resources Canada |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023111/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |archivedate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |title=North America's First Solar Powered Subdivision - Drake Landing |publisher=[[Okotoks|Town of Okotoks]] |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103002142/http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |archivedate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources.

In 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97%; that is, providing that amount of the community's heating requirements with solar energy over a one-year time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Natural Resources Canada|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2012/6586|title=Canadian Solar Community Sets New World Record for Energy Efficiency and Innovation|date= 5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong |first1=B.|last2= Thornton |first2=J. |year=2013|url=http://www.geo-exchange.ca/en/UserAttachments/flex1304_5-%20SAIC-%20Bill%20Wong%202013%20-%20Integrating%20Solar%20and%20Heat%20Pumps.pdf|format=PDF|title=Integrating Solar &amp; Heat Pumps|website= Presentation at Renewable Heat Workshop|accessdate= 31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

There are 52 homes in this subdivision that contain an array of 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-[[watt]]s of [[Solar water heating|thermal power]]. A [[glycol]] solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the [[heat exchanger]] within the community’s Energy Centre. This is known as the Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50&amp;nbsp;°C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.

In the warmer months the previously heated water is taken from the short-term storage tank to the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage unit is 144 holes located {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the ground and stretches over an approximate area of {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. The water returns to the short-term storage tanks in the Energy Centre to be heated again in order to complete the circuit. During colder months the water from the BTES passes back to the short-term storage tank and is then directed to each home. Similar to a [[Hot water storage tank|hot water tank]], the heated water goes through a heat exchanger that blows air across the warm fan coil. Heat travels from the water to the air and is directed through the house via ductwork. When the temperature reaches that said on the thermostat, an automatic valve shuts off the heat transfer unit.&lt;ref name="dlsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlsc.ca/|title=Drake Landing Solar Community|work=dlsc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy centre ==

The Energy Centre building is a 232 square metre (2,500 square feet) building which began operation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/bjul15/DLSC_SHC_2012_final.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the short-term storage tanks and most mechanical equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, and controls. The Solar Collector Loop, the District Heating Loop, and the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage Loop pass through the Energy Centre. Two horizontal water tanks occupy the majority of the space within the Energy Centre. These tanks are {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length. The remaining space within the Energy Centre houses pumps, valves, heat exchangers and other necessary equipment to operate and control the energy system. These tanks are known as [[Energy storage#Short-term thermal storage.2C as heat or cold|Short-Term Thermal Storage]] (STTS).&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Borehole thermal energy system ==

The Borehole Thermal Energy System is located underground to store large quantities of heat collected in the summer to be used in the winter. It consists of 144 [[boreholes]], which stretch to a depth of {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At the surface the pipes are joined together in groups of six to connect to the Energy Centre. The entire BTES is covered by a layer of insulation, on top of which a park is built. When the heated water is to be stored, it is pumped through the pipe series. The heat is then transferred to the surrounding soil as the water cools and returns to the Energy Centre. When the homes need heat, water flows to the centre of the BTES field and picks up the heat from the surrounding soil. The heated water then goes to the short-term energy tank in the Energy Centre and is pumped through the District Heating Loop to the homes.&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Sponsors and partners ==

This project was conceived by [[Natural Resources Canada]]’s CanmetENERGY in partnership with governmental organizations and Canadian industries. Of the $7 million needed for this project this was the breakdown of funds: 
*$2 million from federal government agencies.
*$2.9 million from the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] and Green Municipal Investment Fund. 
*$625,000 from the Alberta Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community members ==

Homeowners were willing to pay for these energy efficient homes because it ensured high quality construction. Until the solar heating system began working, [[ATCO]] Gas (an Alberta-based natural gas distribution company) fixed heating costs at $60 per month for the homeowners at the Drake Landing Solar Community.  With rising fuel costs, this was a powerful incentive for homeowners to support the DLSC project. Even if the project had failed, ATCO Gas would have replaced the special hot-water furnaces with traditional natural gas ones. There was limited risk to the homeowners and this encouraged them to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1696/1/Wamboldt_Jason_M_200901_Master.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local sustainability ==

The 52 homes in Drake Landing Solar Community are certified to Natural Resource Canada’s [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] Standard as well as the Built Green™ Alberta Gold Standard.

== Costs and financing ==

*Each house sold for an average of $380,000.
*Homeowners are receiving an average of $60 per month solar utility bill for heating.
*$7 million for the initial start up of the Drake Landing Solar Community project.
*If this project were repeated it would cost $4 million, as approximately $3 million was for one-time research and development.
*Optimal community size would be 200-300 homes to realize the economies of scale. The number of systems would remain the same; only the number of boreholes would need to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf.|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International effects ==

A group of researchers from South Korea visited Drake Landing Solar Community in April 2012 to study the geothermal heating technology and how it can be applied to communities in South Korea, particularly ahead of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]]. The main focus of this research trip was to learn about the economics and reliability of the technology.&lt;ref name="westernwheel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernwheel.com/article/20120425/WHE0801/304259996/-1/whe/korean-researchers-learn-from-drake-landing|title=Korean researchers learn from Drake Landing|work=Okotoks Western Wheel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==

On October 5, 2012 the DLSC set a new world record by covering 97% of space heating needs with solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2012/2012/kw41/canadian-drake-landing-community-sets-world-record-for-solar-heating.html|title=Canadian Drake Landing community sets world record for solar heating|work=solarserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015-2016 heating season, 100% of space heating needs were met with solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/ Accessed on June 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">'''Engineering mathematics''' is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] concerning [[mathematical models|mathematical methods and techniques]] that are typically used in [[engineering]] and [[manufacturing|industry]]. Along with fields like [[engineering physics]] and [[engineering geology]], both of which may belong in the wider category [[engineering science]], engineering mathematics is an [[interdisciplinary]] subject motivated by engineers' needs both for [[practical]], [[theoretical]] and other considerations outwith their specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective in their work.

==Description==
Historically, engineering mathematics consisted mostly of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably: [[differential equations]]; [[real analysis|real]] and [[complex analysis]] (including [[vector analysis|vector]] and [[tensor analysis]]); [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include  [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]], [[Calculus of variations|variational]], and [[perturbation theory|perturbative methods]], [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[numerical analysis]]); [[Fourier analysis]]; [[potential theory]]; as well as  [[linear algebra]] and applied [[probability]], outside of analysis.  These areas of mathematics were intimately tied to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and the [[mathematical physics]] of that period.  This history also left a legacy: until the early 20th century subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in (applied) mathematics  as well as engineering departments.&lt;ref name=Stolz2002&gt;{{Citation

The success of modern numerical computer methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]] (the last two are sometimes lumped together and abbreviated as '''CS&amp;E'''), which occasionally use [[high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary fields, but are also of interest to engineering mathematics.&lt;ref&gt; T.J. Fairclough, [http://mathapps.net/compalg/compalg.pdf Engineering Mathematics and Computer Algebra.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized branches include [[engineering optimization]] and [[engineering statistics]].

Engineering mathematics in [[tertiary education]] typically consists of mathematical methods and models courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2974079?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents  Minimum Courses in Engineering Mathematics,] S. Epsteen.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnogeology''' is the study of how [[geological]] features were understood by ancient peoples around the globe from a "place-based" perspective, in specific reference to [[traditional knowledge]] and to the stories and ideas about the Earth that were passed down through traditions and the wisdom of elders.  The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of [[minorities]] and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole.  Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], and [[geology]]. The term "ethnogeology" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1996, Of pipestone, thunderbird nests, and ilmenite: ethnogeology, myth, and the renaming of a world: Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 28, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1997, Ethnogeology and its implications for the aboriginal geoscience curriculum: Journal of Geoscience Education, v. 45, p. 117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth's history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).

One global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and [[arrowhead]]s.  Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools.  These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms.  Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with.  [[Flint]], [[obsidian]], [[chert]], [[copper]] and [[quartz]] were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.

In addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation.  Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade.  Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries.  Gold and silver are prized for jewelry and trade.  Good soil is needed for agriculture.  Mountains and rivers provided natural boundaries, defence, and borders for various political groups.

The '''European Forest Institute''' (EFI) is an international organization established by the European states.
It has 29 Member Countries, and c. 115 member organizations from 37 different countries working in diverse research fields. EFI provides forest-related knowledge around three interconnected and interdisciplinary themes: [http://www.efi.int/portal/research/bioeconomy/ bioeconomy], [https://www.efi.int/resilience resilience] and [https://www.efi.int/governance governance]. 

== Organization ==

[[File:EFI Headquarters.jpg|thumb|left]]

===  Places and staff ===
EFI' s headquarters is located in [[Joensuu]], Finland, and also it has offices in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, as well as project offices in Malaysia and China. It employs a staff of over 100 experts.

=== Country members ===
The [[Treaty|Convention]] on the European Forest Institute has been ratified by total of 29 European countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efi.int/portal/about_efi/organisation/country_members___council/ List of EFI Country members]&lt;/ref&gt; by the summer of 2018, namely Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. These countries each have a seat in the highest [[decision-making]] body in EFI's organisation, the Council.

=== Associate and Affiliate members ===
EFI currently has approximately 110 [http://www.efi.int/portal/members/member_organisations/ member organisations] from more than 37 countries. The benefits of associate and affiliate membership include voting rights for important decisions, access to the EFI network, news and announcements related to European forest research, visibility on the EFI website, and opportunity to receive EFI publications and publish announcements in EFI Network News free of charge.

=== Project centres ===
EFI also has [http://www.efi.int/portal/about_efi/structure/project_centres/ project centres] around Europe. These centres focus on specific topics relevant to particular regions or important issues.

== Activities ==
EFI conducts [http://www.efi.int/portal/research/ research] and provides policy support on forest related issues. Further, it facilitate and stimulates forest related networking as well as promotes the supply of unbiased and policy relevant information on forests and forestry. It also advocates for forest research and for scientifically sound information as a basis for policy-making on forests. 
 
EFI excels in carrying out [http://www.efi.int/portal/research/projects/ projects] at the European level, and has a track record of over 30 projects carried out for the European Commission DGs during the past few years. EFI puts increasing emphasis on cross-sectoral approaches in its research and development activities. It is thus in a good position to have efficient access to social, economic and environmental expertise covering all of Europe’s bio-geographical regions. The work in the field of policy support includes enhanced support for decision takers and policy makers. For example, the high-level forum on forests, [http://www.efi.int/portal/policy_advice/thinkforest/ ThinkForest], brings together high-level policy makers and leading European forest scientists to generate science-policy dialogue on strategic forest-related issues. EFI is quickly becoming a leading science-policy platform providing forest-related knowledge to build a sustainable future: connecting knowledge to action.

EFI has a strong policy support role by hosting the EU FLEGT Facility &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euflegt.efi.int/portal/ EU FLEGT Facility]&lt;/ref&gt; which supports the EU [[Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade]] (FLEGT) process in developing countries, related to the implementation of the [[Illegal_logging#EU_FLEGT_Action_Plan|EU FLEGT Action Plan]]. EU FLEGT Facility assist the European Commission and the EU Member States in their joint efforts of its implementation.

In music, a '''''Flute method''''' is a kind of specific [[textbook]] style manual for playing the [[Western concert flute|flute]]. It usually contains [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] charts and/or [[musical scale|scales]] and numerous different [[exercise]]s, sometimes also simple [[etude]]s, in different [[key (music)|key]]s, in ascending order as to difficulty (= in methodical ''progression'') or with a focus on isolated aspects like fluency, [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]] and the like. Sometimes there are duets or even [[recital]] pieces, also with accompaniment. Such methods differ from etude books in that they are meant as a linear course for a student to follow, with consistent guidance, whereas volumes of etudes are not as comprehensive.

As typical instrumental methods are meant to function as textbooks supporting an instrumental teacher (rather than to facilitate self-teaching), usually no basic or special playing techniques are covered in any depth. Detailed instructions in this respect are only found in special, [[Autodidacticism|autodidactical]] methods.

Some methods are specially tailored for students on certain [[skill]] levels or [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]]. In contrast, a 'complete' method (sometimes in multiple volumes) is meant to accompany the student until he or she becomes an advanced player.

Methods of certain authors or editors have achieved the status of standard works (reflecting regional and cultural differences) and are published or reissued by different [[publishing]] companies and often in new layouts or [[arrangement]]s. The [[Suzuki Method]] is one of the most well known examples of this.

The following is a list of various methods of historical interest.

'''Forensic tire tread evidence''' records and analyzes impressions of vehicle tire [[tread]]s for use in legal proceedings to help prove the identities of persons at a [[crime scene]].  Every tire will show different amounts of tread wear, and different amounts of damage in the form of tiny cuts and nicks. These unique characteristics will also show on the impression left by the tire.

This [[Forensic science|forensic]] technique was first invented in 1930 by David Chapman, a researcher affiliated with the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff's Office in Los Angeles, California]], in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''The Sir [[James George Frazer]] Memorial Lectureship in [[Social Anthropology]]''' is a British academic lecture series.

In 1920 a sum of £675 was raised by a Committee of the University of Cambridge for the purpose of commemorating Sir James Frazer’s contributions to learning. In accordance with the wishes of the subscribers, a Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology was founded, the annual income of the fund being assigned to the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Glasgow]] and [[University of Liverpool]] in rotation for this purpose.

Each grammar works on a string, a so-called ''sequential form'' that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of [[Intelligent agent|agents]] in [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a simple [[reactive agent]] moving on the table and trying not to fall down from the table with two reactions, ''t'' for turning and ''&amp;fnof;'' for moving forward. The set of possible behaviors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; can then be described as [[formal language]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}=\{(f^mt^nf^r)^+:1\leq m\leq k; 1\leq n\leq \ell;1\leq r\leq k\},&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Grammar system diagram.svg|thumb|450px|right|System of grammars sequentially rewriting shared string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;]] Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G_A}&lt;/math&gt; be a formal grammar which generates language &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}&lt;/math&gt;. The behavior of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is then described by this grammar. Suppose the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[subsumption architecture]]; each component of this architecture can be then represented as a formal grammar too and the final behavior of the agent is then described by this ''system of grammars''.

The schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent.

If grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a ''Cooperating Distributed (DC)'' grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in [[AI]],&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt; which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard.

Each grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a ''Parallel Communicating (PC)'' grammar system.&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

PC and DC are inspired by distributed AI.  If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called ''colonies'' or ''Eco-Grammar'' systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

'''Grazing fire''' is a term used in [[military science]] and defined by NATO and the US Department Of Defense as “Fire approximately parallel to the ground where the center of the cone of fire does not rise above one meter from the ground.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html "DOD Dictionary of Military Terms"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing fire is often performed by [[machine guns]]. It is tactically advantageous when attempting to cut off an infantry ground assault or counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/23-65/index.html Army Field Manual No. 23-65] "BROWNING MACHINE GUN CALIBER .50 HB, M2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Grazing fire is when the cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave the barrel of the weapon at the axis of bore set from the angle of sight desired to strike the target area. The trajectory of the round should be constant as well as maximum ordinate. Maximum ordinate is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a semi-flat trajectory. With [[7.62×51mm NATO]] ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the [[M240]] machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered [[plunging fire]] due to the arc (axis of bore + angle of sight) needed to impact the target area.

Grazing fire is so named because it cuts the vegetation low as though a herd of cattle had been grazing there. The optimal height of fire should be at knee height. In addition to keeping the enemy pinned down, anybody wounded or going to cover will fall into the line of fire, not out of it.

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

The '''Institute for New Testament Textual Research''' ({{lang-de|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung}} — INTF) at the [[University of Münster]], [[Westphalia]], [[Germany]], is to research the textual history of the New Testament and to reconstruct its Greek initial text on the basis of the entire manuscript tradition, the early translations and patristic citations; furthermore the preparation of an ''[[Editio Critica Maior]]'' based on the entire tradition of the [[New Testament]] in Greek manuscripts, early versions and [[List of New Testament Church Fathers|New Testament quotations]] in ancient Christian literature. Under [[Kurt Aland]]'s supervision, the INTF collected almost the entire material that was needed - Manuscript count 1950: 4250; 1983: 5460; 2017: approx. 5800. 

Moreover, INTF produces several more editions and a variety of tools for [[New Testament]] scholarship, including the concise editions known as the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]] 
and the UBS [[Greek New Testament]]. Many of the results are also available to the wider public at the adjoining [[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]], which is affiliated with the institute.

First supplements of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the [[Catholic Letters]] and [[The Acts of the Apostels]] have been published since 1997. 

== History ==
The INTF was founded in [[Münster]], Germany, in 1959 by Kurt Aland (1915-1994). Since the 1950s Aland had been working on Eberhard and [[Erwin Nestle]]'s [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]. At the INTF the concise scholarly edition saw further revisions and publications, until it became the trade-mark of the institute under the name of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]]. In 1966, a second concise edition intended for translators, the [[Greek New Testament]], was published. The great [[papyri]] discoveries of the 20th century were of special relevance for a new reconstruction of the text published in both the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland and the third edition of the Greek New Testament. Both editions contain the identical text while differing in their apparatus.

However, the main objective of the Institute was the so-called [[Editio Critica Maior]] based on the entire tradition of the New Testament in [[Biblical manuscript|Greek manuscripts]], old translations and New Testament quotations in ancient Christian literature. The pre-requisite for the realisation of this task was the sifting and examination of the entire manuscript tradition of the Greek New Testament. Under the supervision of Kurt Aland the INTF first of all collected almost the entire material (partly on extensive manuscript travels), followed by analyses in single editions and specific studies in preparation of the Editio critia Maior.

Kurt Aland found a friend and patron in Bishop Hermann Kunst. In 1964 the latter established the foundation “Hermann Kunst Foundation for the Promotion of New Testament Textual Research” that has granted crucial financial support to the Institute ever since.

In 1979, Kurt Aland founded the [[Bible Museum Münster]] that presents the work of the institute to the general public.

In 1983, [[Barbara Aland]] succeeded her husband as director of the Institute. Under her supervision, the analysis of the material that had been started under Kurt Aland continued and was made accessible for research in numerous publications. The first supplement of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the Epistle of James was finally published in 1997. Barbara Aland led the Institute until 2004.

Since October 2004 [http://www.wwu.de/EvTheol/personen/strutwolf.html Holger Strutwolf] has been in office as director of the Institute and the Bible Museum.

In 2007 the "Northrhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences and Arts" accepted the [[Editio Critica Maior]] as one of their projects. In the following year the project was established at Münster University as “Novum Testamentum Graecum - Editio Critica Maior”.

== Profile ==

'''History of the textual tradition of the New Testament''' - It is the task of the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) to comprehensively document and analyse the history of the textual tradition of the New Testament in its Greek original language.

'''List of Greek NT manuscripts''' - The Institute for New Testament Textual Research operates the international recording list of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. All newly discovered manuscripts anywhere in the world are being recorded, examined and provided with a short description at the Institute.

'''Reconstruction of the initial text''' - The core objective is to gain an impression, for the first time based on the entire material available today, of the textual history, and to reconstruct from this the initial text of the New Testament tradition. The result of this work is being published in the Editio Critica Maior.

'''Scholarly concise editions and tools''' - It has always been a distinguished task of the INTF to answer the need for scholarly concise editions based on the current state of research (Nestle-Aland, Greek New Testament, Synopsis) and scholarly reference works (concordances, Bauer-Aland). The concise editions have been continued, but they have also been supplemented by a digital edition and transcripts of important manuscripts on the Internet and a virtual manuscript room to make use of the advantages of that medium. All editions will increasingly benefit from the insights gained in the work on the [[Editio Critica Maior]].

''' New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room ''' - The INTF provides an electronic text critical resource, the ''[[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] (NT.VMR)'' - a virtual manuscript reading room, where New Testament manuscripts can be viewed online. Digitized manuscripts can be viewed in the VMR individually in facsimile and as transcript, if available.

'''«Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Textforschung»''' - Under this title, INTF publishes its own series. It mainly contains research results and studies from various projects of INTF.

'''Bible Museum''' - It is also highly relevant for the INTF not only to connect with the academic world but also to reach out to the broader public through the affiliated Bible Museum and through exhibitions outside the institute.

== Manuscripts ==
The INTF also holds some manuscripts of the New Testament, and took responsibility for registering the New Testament manuscripts (named the "[[Gregory-Aland]] numbers"), and for editing the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]. 

Minuscules: 
[[Minuscule 676|676]], [[Minuscule 798|798]], [[Minuscule 1432|1432]], [[Minuscule 2444|2444]], [[Minuscule 2445|2445]], [[Minuscule 2446|2446]], [[Minuscule 2460|2460]], [[Minuscule 2754|2754]], [[Minuscule 2755|2755]], [[Minuscule 2756|2756]], [[Minuscule 2793|2793]];

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">The '''International Association of Schools of Social Work''' ('''IASSW''') is the worldwide association of schools of social work, other tertiary level social work educational programs, and social work educators. The IASSW promotes the development of social work education throughout the world, develops standards to enhance quality of social work education, encourages international exchange, provides forums for sharing social work research and scholarship, and promotes human rights and social development through policy and advocacy activities.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Truell |first=Rory |date=7 July 2014 |title=What is social work? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jul/07/what-is-social-work |newspaper=The Guardian |location=Manchester, England |access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Healy |first1=Lynne M. |last2=Link |first2=Rosemary J. |date=2012 |title=Handbook of International Social Work: Human Rights, Development, and the Global Profession |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195333616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASSW was founded in 1928 at the First International Conference of Social Work, held in [[Paris]]. It initially comprised 51 schools, mostly in Europe, and was known as the International Committee. Revitalized after World War II, the organization expanded its membership to include a wider range of countries and was renamed the International Association of Schools of Social Work.&lt;ref name="Book1"/&gt;

Membership in the IASSW comprises social work educational programs at the post-secondary or tertiary level and interested individuals, mostly social work educators. The association has member schools in all parts of the world. Five 5 regional organizations in Africa; Asia and the Pacific; Europe; Latin America; and North America and the Caribbean are affiliated with the IASSW. IASSW is governed by the Board of Directors under a Constitution approved by the biennial General Assembly. IASSW holds consultative status with the United Nations and participates as an NGO in UN activities in Geneva, Vienna and New York. Through its work at the UN and with other international organizations, IASSW represents social work education at the international level.&lt;ref name="Book1"/&gt;

According to the current IASSW Constitution, the organization is governed by the Board of Directors, made up of both elected and appointed members. Starting from 1928 the IASSW had 12 Presidents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The '''International Center for Research on Women''' ('''ICRW''') is a [[non-profit]] organization headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], with a regional office in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. ICRW has project offices in Mumbai and Hyderabad [[India]], and is establishing a formal presence in East Africa. ICRW works to promote [[gender equity|gender equitable]] development within the field of [[international development]].

==Mission==
According to the organization Web site:

{{quote|ICRW's mission is to empower women, advance gender equality and fight poverty in the developing world. To accomplish this, ICRW works with partners to conduct empirical research, build capacity and advocate for evidence-based, practical ways to change policies and programs.}}

==Focus areas==
ICRW research identifies women's contributions to their communities and the barriers – like HIV, violence, and lack of education – that prevent them from being economically stable and able to fully participate in society. It focuses on three paths of action to achieve this:

* Designing concrete, evidence-based plans for program designers, donors and policymakers that empower women to control their lives and help shape the future of their communities
* Measuring changes in the lives of women and girls – as well as men and boys – to know how best to achieve gender equality
* Recommending policy priorities that give women opportunities to transform their lives

Some of its priorities include the economic empowerment of women, the prevention of HIV/[[AIDS]] among women and girls, the elimination of violence against women, the creation of better life options for women and girls, combating [[child marriage]], and increasing food security for vulnerable women.

ICRW is primarily a research institution whose strong quantitative and qualitative research contributes to the direct action of organizations and communities in which they work.

ICRW's tagline is, "ICRW turns insight into action."

==Leadership==
ICRW is led by President Dr. Sarah Degnan Kambou, a social scientist [[Sarah Degnan Kambou]] who was appointed by the board in 2010. Previously Dr. Degnan Kambou served for two years as ICRW's chief operating officer (COO) under former president [[Geeta Rao Gupta]], and then as interim president and COO after Rao Gupta stepped down in April 2010.

Degnan Kambou joined ICRW in 2002. As COO, she led the organization's research and programs, finance and human resources departments as well as ICRW's Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India. Before that, she was vice president of health and development, overseeing research in HIV and AIDS, reproductive health and nutrition as well as in gender, violence and women's rights.

In 2012 President Barack Obama appointed Dr. Degnan Kambou to his [https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/advisory-boards/global-development-council Global Development Council], which advises him and members of his Cabinet on how to improve U.S. foreign assistance. In 2010, Dr. Degnan Kambou was appointed by United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to represent ICRW on the U.S. National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]).

Degnan Kambou holds a doctorate in international health policy and a master's in public health from Boston University. She earned her bachelor's degree in French from the University of Connecticut.

Degnan Kambou is ICRW's fourth president in its 40-year history. [[Ravi Verma]] is the director of ICRW's Asia Regional Office, and Stella Mukasa directs its Africa Regional Office.

==Board of directors==
ICRW has been directed by several renowned and well-recognized individuals within the field of international development as well as other key private sector and government individuals, including Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]], writer [[Ann Crittenden]], and [[Brooke Shearer]] (deceased, May 19, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0509/Brooke_Shearer_RIP.html?showall|title=Brooke Shearer, R.I.P.|author=Ben Smith|work=politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; spouse of [[Strobe Talbott]], director of the [[Brookings Institution]].

{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic toilet etiquette''' describes the rules that the [[Islam]]ic faith has regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code of [[Muslim hygienical jurisprudence]] is known as ''Qadaa' al-Haajah''. 

The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands ([[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]]). Issues of [[chirality]] (bodily symmetry), such as whether one uses the left or right hand, and which foot is used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC |year=1992 |title=The Tao of Islam |isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8 |author=Sachiko Murata |chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Muslim must first find an acceptable place away from standing water, people's pathways, or shade.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by Abu Hurairah and collected in Sahih Muslim (Book 002, Number 0516&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised that it is better to enter the area with the left foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"&gt;Narrated by Anas bin Malik and collected in Sahih al-Bukhari (Volume 1, Book 4, Number 144) and Sahih Muslim (Book 003, Number 729)&lt;/ref&gt; facing away from the [[Qiblah]] (prayer point).&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;

While on the toilet, one must remain silent. Talking, answering greetings, or greeting others is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;  When defecating together, two men cannot converse, nor look at each other's genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan ibn Majah, 1.342&lt;/ref&gt; A man should not touch his genitals with the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Abu Dawud, 1.1.0031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishkat, 1.185"&gt;Mishkat, 1.185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mishkat, 1.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Nasai, 1.24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2.0512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whenever anyone of you drinks water, he should not breathe in the drinking utensil, and whenever anyone of you goes to a lavatory, he is advised better to neither touch his penis nor clean his private parts with his right hand."

The [[anal cleansing|anus must be washed with water]] after [[defecating]]. Similarly, the [[penis]] and [[vulva]] must be washed with water after urinating. This washing is known as ''[[istinja]]''. The Qur'an suggests that one should wash one's hands as well, which is discussed in [[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]].

When leaving the toilet, one is advised to leave with the right foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"/&gt; and also say a prayer – "Praise be to Allah who relieved me of the filth and gave me relief."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt; It is also reported in the hadith of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] that whenever Muhammad went to the toilet, he said "In the name of [[Allah]], O Allah! I seek refuge with You from all offensive and wicked things" (alternate translation: "from evil deeds and evil spirits").&lt;ref&gt;Hadith of Bukhari: Volumes I, II, III &amp; IV. 1944. P.39.

'''Kenneth Duva Burke''' (May 5, 1897 – November 19, 1993) was an American [[literary theory|literary theorist]], as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[criticism]], and [[rhetoric|rhetorical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toye, ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional [[rhetoric]] and view literature as "[[symbol|symbolic action]]."

Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his career, Burke has been praised by ''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'' as "one of the most unorthodox, challenging, and theoretically sophisticated American-born literary critics of the twentieth century." His work continues to be discussed by rhetoricians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal history==
He was born on May 5 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and graduated from [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]], where his friend [[Malcolm Cowley]] was also a student. While he attended [[Ohio State University]] to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].&lt;ref name=wolin&gt;

Edited by Bekah Shaia Dickstein, 2004. http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Burke__Kenneth.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenwich Village]] he kept company with [[avant-garde]] writers such as [[Hart Crane]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Gorham Munson]], and later [[Allen Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;Selzer, Jack. ''Kenneth Burke in Greenwich Village: Conversing with the Moderns, 1915–1931''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.

In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist  anthropologist [[Eleanor Leacock]] (1922–1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the [[The Dial#The Dial Award|Dial Award]] in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1934–1936, and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight.  As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including [[Bennington College]], while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807002118/http://www.libraries.psu.edu//psul/speccolls/rbm/burke.html Special Collections Library]. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an [[autodidact]] and a self-taught scholar.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters from Kenneth Burke to William H. Rueckert, 1959-198", edited by William H. Rueckert, Indiana, Parlor Press LLC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson [[Harry Chapin]], a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in [[Andover, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE099E1B49D55&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "KENNETH BURKE, 96 PHILOSOPHER, WRITER ON LANGUAGE"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 22, 1993. Accessed July 16, 2008. "Kenneth Burke, a philosopher who was influential in American literary circles, has died. He was 96. Mr. Burke died Friday of heart failure at his home in Andover, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persuasions and influences==
Burke, like many twentieth century theorists and critics, was heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He was a lifelong interpreter of [[Shakespeare]] and was also significantly influenced by [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He resisted being pigeonholed as a follower of any philosophical or political school of thought, and had a notable and very public break with the [[Marxism|Marxists]] who dominated the literary criticism set in the 1930s.

Burke corresponded with a number of literary critics, thinkers, and writers over the years, including [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]], [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Hart Crane]], and [[Marianne Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.psu.edu/content/dam/psul/up/speccolls/documents/Burke-1_Correspondents.pdf "List of Correspondents in Kenneth Burke Papers"], Kenneth Burke Papers, Special Collections Library, Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers who have acknowledged Burke's influence include [[Harold Bloom]], [[Stanley Cavell]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], [[Susan Sontag]] (his student at the University of Chicago), [[Erving Goffman]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. N. (1978). ''Social Exchange, Dramaturgy and Ethnomethodology: Toward a Paradigmatic Synthesis.'' New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Edward Said]], [[René Girard]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Michael Calvin McGee]], [[Dell Hymes]] and [[Clifford Geertz]]. Burke was one of the first prominent American critics to appreciate and articulate the importance of Thomas Mann and André Gide; Burke produced the first English translation of "Death in Venice", which first appeared in ''The Dial'' in 1924. It is now considered to be much more faithful and explicit than H. T. Lowe-Porter's more famous 1930 translation.

Burke's political engagement is evident—''A Grammar of Motives'' takes as its epigraph, ''ad bellum purificandum'' (toward the purification of war).

American literary critic Harold Bloom singled out Burke's ''Counterstatement'' and ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' for inclusion in his "Western Canon".

Beyond his contemporary influences, Burke took [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teachings into account while developing his theories on rhetoric. A significant source of his ideas is Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Drawing from this work, Burke oriented his writing about language specifically to its social context. Similarly, he studied language as involving more than logical discourse and grammatical structure because he recognized that the social context of language cannot be reduced to principles of pure reason.

Burke draws a line between a Platonic and a more contemporary view of rhetoric, described as "old rhetoric" and "new rhetoric" respectively. The former is defined by persuasion by any means, while the latter is concerned with "[[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|identification]]."  In Burke's use of the word identification he is describing the process by which the speaker associates herself/himself with certain groups, such as a target audience.  
His idea of "identification" is similar to ethos of classical rhetoric, but it also explains the use of logos and pathos in an effort to create a lasting impression on the auditors. This theory differs from ethos most significantly in Burke's conception of artistic communication that he believes is defined by eloquence, which is "simply the end of art and therefore its essence."  The use of rhetoric conveys aesthetic and social competence which is why a text can rarely be reduced to purely scientific or political implications, according to Burke. Rhetoric forms our social identity by a series of events usually based on linguistics, but more generally by the use of any symbolic figures.  He uses the metaphor of a drama to articulate this point, where interdependent characters speak and communicate with each other while allowing the others to do the same.  Also, Burke describes identification as a function of persuasive appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Gregory. [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2207/27%281%29+50-59.pdf?sequence=1 "Kenneth Burke's Rhetorical Theory within the Construction of the Enthnography of Speaking."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke defined [[rhetoric]] as the "use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents." His definition builds on the preexisting ideas of how people understand the meaning of rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (A Rhetoric of Motives, 1950). Burke argued that rhetoric works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burke stated but it can also be physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of rhetoric. [[Aristotle]] argued that rhetoric was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated that rhetoric had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through [[syllogism]]. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberate discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. [[Sally Miller Gearhart|Sally Gearhart]] states that rhetoric uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.

==Philosophy==
The political and social power of ''symbols'' was central to Burke's scholarship throughout his career. He felt that through understanding "what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it", we could gain insight into the cognitive basis for our perception of the world. For Burke, the way in which we decide to narrate gives importance to specific qualities over others. He believed that this could tell us a great deal about how we see the world.

===Dramatism===
Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis "[[dramatism]]" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.

Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as "a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."  His [[definition of humanity]] states that "man" is "the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Definition of Man." ''The Hudson Review'' 16 4 (1963/1964): 491-514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Richard M. "Defining Rhetoric—and Us: A Meditation on Burke's Definition." ''Composition Theory for the Postmodern Classroom''. Eds. Olson, Gary A. and Sidney I. Dobrin. Albany: SUNY Press, 1994. 332-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.

Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the [[dramatistic pentad]].  The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism "invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action" (Grammar of Motives xxii).  Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant [[sociological criticism|sociological]] impact; he saw literature as "equipment for living," offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives.

===Rebirth Cycle===
Through the use of dramatism, one can ultimately utilize Burke's Rebirth Cycle.  This cycle encompasses three distinct phases, which include: Guilt/Pollution, Purification, and Redemption.  Burke introduced the phases and their functionality through the use of a poem.  The poem follows, 
Here are the steps
In the Iron Law of History That welds Order and Sacrifice 
Order leads to Guilt
(For who can keep commandments!) Guilt needs Redemption
(for who would not be cleaned!) Redemption needs Redeemer (which is to say, a Victim!) 
Order
Through Guilt
To Victimage
(hence: Cult of the Kill)..." (p. 4-5) &lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke's poem provides a basis of for the interactions of the three phases. Order's introduction into the life of human enables the creation of guilt. In order to alleviate the results produced by the creation of Guilt, redemption is necessitated.  Through the abstraction of redemption, Burke leads to the completion of the cycle.

Pollution initially constitutes actions taken by an individual that result in the creation of Guilt.  The creation of Guilt occurs upon the rejection of a hierarchy. Challenges to relationships, changes in power, and appropriateness of behaviors to change are each contributing factors toward the formation of Guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Rybacki, Karyn &amp; Rybacki, Donald. Communication Criticism: Approaches and Genres. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is appropriate to draw parallels between the creation of Guilt, and the concept of original sin. Original sin constitutes "... an offense that cannot be avoided or a condition in which all people share".&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K., Foss, Karen A., and Trapp, Robert. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc., 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt represents the initial action that strips a situation of its perceived purity. The establishment of Guilt necessarily leads to the need to undergo purification to cleanse the individual affected by its recognition.  Purification is thus accomplished through two forms of "ritual purification." Mortification and victimage represent the available avenues of purification

Stratification within society created by hierarchies allows for marginalization within societies.  Marginalization thus is a leading factor in the creation of Guilt, and leads to the need for mortification. Burke stated, "In an emphatic way, mortification is the exercising of oneself in 'virtue'; it is a systematic way of saying no to Disorder, or obediently saying yes to Order".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortification allows an individual's self-sacrifice which consequently enables them to rid themselves of impurities. Purification will only be reached, if it is equal to an individual's degree of guilt.  If mortification cannot be reached, individuals will ultimately be forced to project, "his conflict upon a scapegoat, by 'passing the buck,' by seeking a sacrificial vessel upon which he can vent, as from without, a turmoil that is actually within".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kennth. A Rhetoric of Motives. Berkley: University of California Press, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrificial vessels allow for the extermination of an individual's Guilt while enabling them to remain virtuous. 
Victimage is the second form of ritual purification. Burke highlights society's need to rectify division within its ranks. He contended that "People so dislike the idea of division, their dislike can easily be turned against the man or group who would so much as name it, let alone proposing to act upon it".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth"The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle."" Readings in Rhetorical Criticism. Ed. Carl R. Burgchardt. State College: STRATA Publishing, Inc. 2010. 238-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Victimage allows for the creation of a scapegoat that serves as a depository of impurities in order to protect against entities that are alien to a particular society. The scapegoat takes on the sins of the impure, thus allowing redemption for the Guilty party.  Unfortunately, through the course of these actions the scape goat is harnessed with the sins of the Guilty.

Redemption is reached through one of two options. Tragic redemption revolves around the idea that guilt combines with the principles of perfection and substitution in order that victimage can be utilized. This can be viewed as the "guilty is removed from the rhetorical community through either scapegoating or mortification".&lt;ref&gt;Borchers, Timothy. Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction, Long Grove: Waveland Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic enlightenment is the second form of redemption.  This option allows the sins of the guilty to be adopted by Society as a whole, ultimately making Society guilty by association.

===Terministic screen===
Another key concept for Burke is the [[Terministic screens|Terministic screen]]—a ''set'' of symbols that becomes a kind of ''screen'' or grid of intelligibility through which the world makes sense to us.  Here Burke offers rhetorical theorists and critics a way of understanding the relationship between language and ideology.  Language, Burke thought, doesn't simply "reflect" reality; it also helps ''select'' reality as well as ''deflect'' reality. In ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), he writes, "Even if any given terminology is a ''reflection'' of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a ''selection'' of reality; and to this extent must function also as a ''deflection'' of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bizzell | last2 = Herzberg | title = The Rhetorical Tradition | edition = 2 | editors = Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg | pages = 1340–47 | accessdate = 2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Burke describes terministic screens as reflections of reality—we see these symbols as things that direct our attention to the topic at hand. For example, photos of the same object with different filters each direct the viewer's attention differently, much like how different subjects in academia grab the attention differently.  Burke states, "We must use terministic screens, since we can't say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another." Burke drew not only from the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles, but from films and radio that were important to pop culture, because they were teeming with "symbolic and rhetorical ingredients." We as a people can be cued to accept the screen put in front of us, and mass culture such as TV and websites can be to blame for this. Media today has altered terministic screens, or as [[Richard Toye]] wrote in his book ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction'',  the "linguistic filters which cause us to see situations in particular fashions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Killian, Justin |author2=Larson, Sean |author3=Emanuelle Wessels |title=Language as Symbolic Action|url=http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-965136-8|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==
In "Definition of Man", the first essay of his collection ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), Burke defined humankind as a "symbol using animal" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). This [[definition of man]], he argued, means that "reality" has actually "been built up for us through nothing but our symbol system" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call "reality," Burke stated, is actually a "clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present . . . a construct of our symbol systems" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university's catalogue "are in effect but so many different terminologies" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion's symbol system, inhabit a reality that is different from the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality (no page reference).

Burke's poetry appears in four collections: ''Book of Moments'' (1955), ''Collected Poems 1915–1967'' (1968), the posthumously published ''The Late Poems: 1968-1993 Attitudinizings Verse-wise, While Fending for One's Selph, and in a Style Somewhat Artificially Colloquial'' (2005), and ''Here &amp; Elsewhere: The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Burke'' (2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6671">A '''leaching model''' is a [[hydrology|hydrological]] model by which the leaching with [[irrigation]] water of dissolved substances, notably salt, in the soil is described depending on the hydrological regime and the [[soil]]'s properties. &lt;br&gt;
The model may describe the process (1) in time and (2) as a function of amount of water applied. &lt;br&gt;
Leaching is often done to [[Land improvement|''reclaim'']] [[saline soil]] or to ''conserve'' a favorable salt content of the soil of irrigated land &lt;ref name="Hoorn"&gt;J.W. van Hoorn and J.G. van Alphen (2006), Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (Ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, p. 533-600, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as all irrigation water contains salts.

==Leaching curves==
[[File:saltleaching.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Experimental data of Chacupe pilot area]]
The leaching process in a [[salty soil]] to be reclaimed is illustrated in the leaching curves of figure 1, derived from data of the Chacupe pilot area, [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Alva, J.G. van Alphen, A. de la Torre, L. Manrique, 1976. Problemas de Drenaje y Salinidad en la Costa Peruana. ILRI bulletin 16 (Spanish). International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the [[soil salinity]] in terms of [[electrical conductivity]] (EC) of the soil solution with respect its initial value (ECi) as a function of amount of water percolating through the soil. The top-soil leaches quickly. The salinity of the deeper soil first increases due to the salts leached from the top-soil, but later it also decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Case study leaching (Chacupe). Data from CENDRET/SUDRET project, Peru, 1968 -1974. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/chacupe.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaching efficiency==
[[File:leachingeff.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Figure 2. Principle of leaching efficiency]]
[[File:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure 3. Leaching curves and calibration of leaching efficiency]]
Owing to irregular distribution of salt in the soil or to irregularity of the [[soil structure]] (figure 2), the ''leaching efficiency'' (E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) can be different from unity.

Soils with a low leaching efficiency are difficult to reclaim. In the [[Tagus|Tagus delta]], [[Portugal]], the leaching efficiency of the dense [[clay]] soil was found as low as 0.10 to 0.15.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Vanegas Chacon, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict desalinization in the Leziria Grande Polder, Portugal. Thesis. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The soil could not be developed for intensive [[agriculture]] and was used for rearing of bulls in coarse natural [[pasture]].

The [[clay]] soil in the [[Nile|Nile delta]], [[Egypt]], on the other hand has a much better leaching efficiency of 0.7 to 0.8. In figure 3, leaching curves are shown for different leaching efficiencies, as assumed in the ''leaching model'' [[SaltMod]] &lt;ref&gt;SaltMod: description of principles, user manual and examples of application. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/saltmod.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  with data from the Mashtul pilot area. The observed values of [[soil salinity]] correspond best to a leaching efficiency of about 0.75.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan and M.A.Senna, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict drainage and salinity control in the Nile delta. In: Annual Report 1989, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands, p. 63-74.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure illustrates the calibration process of leaching efficiency, which parameter is difficult to measure directly.

==Leaching requirement==
The ''leaching requirement'' may refer to:
* The total amount of water required to bring the [[soil salinity]] from an initially high value down to an acceptable value in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. From figure 1 it is seen that 800&amp;nbsp;mm of water (or 8000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha) is required to bring the soil salinity down to 60% of its original value in the soil layer at 40 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm depth. When the salinity must be less than 60%, extrapolation of the leaching curve, the use of a ''leaching equation'' (see below) or a leaching model like [[SaltMod]] is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the additional leaching requirement.
* The annual amount of [[percolation]] water (i.e. the extra amount of irrigation water on top of the crop consumptive use) required to conserve an acceptable salt balance of the soil  in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. The ratio
::F&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Perc/Irr, where Perc = amount of required percolation water, and Irr = total amount of irrigation water,
:is called ''leaching fraction'',&lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt; see also below.

==Leaching equation==
The downward limb of the leaching curves, as in figure 3, can be described with the leaching equation:&lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt;
*Ct = Ci + (Co - Ci) exp (-E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.T.Qp/Ws)
where C = salt concentration, Ct = C in the soil at time T, Co = C in the soil at time T=0, Ci = C of the irrigation water, E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = leaching efficiency, Qp = average percolation rate through the soil, and Ws = water stored in the soil at [[field capacity|field saturation]].

==Leaching fraction==
To conserve an acceptable [[Soil salinity control|salt balance]] of the soil  in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown, the leaching fraction must be at least:&lt;ref&gt;L.A.Richards (Ed.), 1954. Diagnosis and improvement of saline and alkali soils. USDA Agricultural Handbook 60. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=10158&amp;page=2 On internet]&lt;/ref&gt;
*F&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Ci/Cs
where Ci = salt concentration of the irrigation water, and Cs is the acceptable salt concentration of the soil moisture at [[field capacity]] in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown.

The '''Mammalian Genetics Unit''' is a genetics and genomics research institute in [[Oxfordshire]].

==History==
Earlier research on the same site at the Radiobiology Research Unit, which opened in 1954, in the 1950s was into [[cytogenetics]], where [[Charles Edmund Ford]] and [[John Hamerton]] confirmed on 12 January 1956 the size of the human genome. In the early 1970s this unit led research into [[Mutagenesis|mutagenic]] effects of radiation on the human chromosome. In the mid-1980s, important early work was done in [[genomic imprinting]].

From 2007, the site no longer carried work into the effects of radiation on genes ([[radiobiology]]).

===MGU===
The MGU is largely derived from the earlier Radiobiology Unit (RBU). In 2010, work at the unit discovered that overexpression of the [[FTO gene]] led to obesity.

==Structure==
The unit is in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="oxfordshireapprenticeships"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordshireapprenticeships.co.uk/content/meet-jess-apprentice-machinist-mrc-harwell|website=oxfordshireapprenticeships.co.uk|title=Oxfordshire Apprenticeships|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The unit carries out work into genetics and [[genome engineering]].

'''Metarealism''' is a direction in [[Russian poetry]] and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by [[Mikhail Epstein|Mikhail Epshtein]], who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine "Voprosy Literatury" in 1983; see below his "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" from 1983 and the following years [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html] Also: Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry. Ed. K. Johnson &amp; S. M. Ashby. Preface by M. Epshtein, A. Wachtel, [[Alexei Parshchikov|A. Parshchikov]]. University of Michigan Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-06415-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 53, 184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=czhO4m4yjZUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA173&amp;lpg=RA1-PA173&amp;dq=metarealism+poetry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9zVPX-rMeG&amp;sig=gKOXtyHheDWHsGEgc15Vh1Gknf4#PPP1,M1], Tom Epstein's essay «Metarealism» in the anthology Crossing Centuries: The New Generations in Russian Poetry. Ed. High, John. NY: Talisman House Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|1-883689-90-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-883689-90-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87-89, and [[Marjorie Perloff]] "Russian Postmodernism: An Oxymoron?" in Postmodern Culture, Volume 3, # 2, January 1993 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v003/3.2perloff.html].

M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] realism," while "stylistically" metarealism is "[[metaphorical]]" realism. (See the most detailed explanation and exposition of this term in Epshtein's articles "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html], "A Catalogue of the New Poetries" (Russian version) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} and in its English version [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.catalog.poetry.html] Thus, "meta" means both "through" and "beyond" the reality that we all can see; hence, "metarealism" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual [[metaphor]] or, according to another Epshtein's term, a "metabola" (rather than [[hyperbole]]), that means "transfer" or "transition," opening many dimensions. [See part 3 in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} "Metabola" is different from the [[symbol]] or a "visual" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism &amp; Contemporary Russian Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995, 416 p.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-87023-973-2}}, {{ISBN|0-87023-974-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–50. Metarealism has very little to do with [[surrealism]], since it appeals to the [[superconscious]] and not to the [[subconscious]], thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.

Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the [[Hyperreality|Hyperrealists]], where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Communication: Transparency, Democracy, Global Governance|last=Mesaros|first=Caludiu|publisher=Editura Universității de Vest|year=2011|isbn=9789731253497|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==What is metarealism?==

[http://www.metarealism.com Metarealism] is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|last2=Genis|first2=Alexander|last3=Vladiv-Glover|first3=Slobodanka|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782388647|location=New York|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] and transcendent meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=0870239732|location=Amherst|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a [[holistic]] view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is "the geometrical space constituted by points of view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Metarealism in visual art==

According to Bernard De Montréal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |title=Bernard de Montreal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114543/http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |archive-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]], sub mental symbolism of the art form an [[avocation]] of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.

Conscious or mental art "metarealism" when created by an metaconscious artist is inspired from the higher self, and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artefact of relative value.

The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative "expiration" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With [[Frederick Luis Aldama]], [[Brian McHale]] and [[Robyn Warhol]], Phelan directs [[Project Narrative]] at [[The Ohio State University]]:)

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuropolitics''' investigates the interplay between the brain and politics.  It combines work from a variety of scientific fields including [[neuroscience]], political science, [[psychology]], [[behavioral genetics]], [[primatology]], and [[ethology]].  Often, neuropolitics research borrow methods from [[cognitive neuroscience]] to investigate classic questions from [[political science]] such as how people make political decisions, form political / ideological attitudes, evaluate political candidates, and interact in political coalitions.  However, another line of research considers the role that evolving political competition has had on the development of the brain in humans and other species.  The research in neuropolitics often intersects with work in [[genopolitics]], [[political psychology]], political physiology, [[sociobiology]], [[neuroeconomics]], and [[neurolaw]].

==History==
Philosophers, including [[Plato]] and [[John Locke]], have long theorized about the nature of human thought and used these theories as a basis for their [[political philosophy]].  In Locke's view, humans entered the world with a mind that was a [[blank slate]] and formed governments as a result of the necessities imposed by the [[state of nature]].  Though Locke was trained in medicine, he became skeptical about the value of anatomical studies of the brain and concluded that no useful insights about mental faculties could be developed by studying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |year=2005 |title=Soul Made Flesh |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Sperry]] and colleagues performed the first published neuropolitics experiment in 1979 with [[split-brain]] patients who had their corpus-callosum severed and thus had two brain hemispheres with severely impaired communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839327990006X |title=Self recognition and social awareness in the deconnected minor hemisphere |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=17 |pages=153–166 |year=1979 |last=Sperry |first=Roger |author2=Eran Zaidel |author3=Dahlia W Zaidel  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(79)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers showed photos of political figures to each of the patients' eyes (and thus each distinct brain hemisphere) separately and asked them to give a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" evaluation.  Both hemispheres were shown to be capable of rendering a political attitude about the people they were viewing.  For instance, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Fidel Castro]] were given a thumbs down, while [[Winston Churchill]] was given a thumbs up, and [[Richard Nixon]] was given a thumb in the neutral position (the experiments were carried out prior to full revelation of the [[Watergate scandal]].)  Each hemisphere attempted to communicate clues about the identity of the individuals to the other hemisphere.  This study demonstrated that neurological approaches could inform researchers' understanding of political attitudes.

[[Frans de Waal]]'s first book in 1982, ''Chimpanzee Politics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Frans |year=1982 |title=Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex among Apes}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the brains of non-human primates like [[chimpanzees]] enabled them to engage in the strategic manipulation of others.  This "[[Machiavellian intelligence]]" facilitated the formation of coalitions and political dynamics with many analogues to human politics.  Later work by [[Robin Dunbar]] suggested a relationship between the size of an animal's neo-cortex and the size of the social group it could successfully manage.  While [[Aristotle's Politics]] compared the mental faculties of humans to other animals in trying to establish a foundation for understanding human politics, the systematic work of de Waal and Dunbar brought rigorous methods for illuminating the relationship between the brain and politics, even across distantly related species.

==Neuroimaging==
The advent of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] gave a new set of tools to [[neuroscience]] that could be used to investigate questions that were difficult or impossible to address previously.  The first neuropolitics studies using fMRI looked at the differences in brain activity between people who were knowledgeable about national politics and those who were not, while they answered political questions.  Following in the tradition of work by [[Philip Converse]] and [[John Zaller]], it found that the politically knowledgeable had elevated levels of activity in the [[default mode network]] of the brain while political novices had diminished activity in the same areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Darren |last=Schreiber |title=Evaluating politics: A search for the neural substrates of political thought |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |year=2005 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/31/96/3196356.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/912.abstract |title=Biology, Politics, and the Emerging Science of Human Nature |journal=Science |volume=322 |pages=912–914 |year=2008 |last=Fowler |first=James |author2=Darren Schreiber  |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.1158188 |issue=5903 |pmid=18988845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsequent study by [[Drew Westen]] and colleagues confirmed the elevated default mode network activity for political sophisticates and suggested differences between Republicans and Democrats in how they think about political questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 |title=Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1947–1958 |year=2006 |last=Westen |first=Drew |author2=Pavel S.

==Politics in other species==
Despite the risks of anthropomorphizing the behaviors of non-human animals, researchers have investigated the politics of a number of social species.  In addition to de Waals' work on chimpanzees, scientists have investigated the dynamics of coalitions in [[hyenas]], [[dolphins]], [[elephants]], and other animals.  In the [[spotted hyena]], for instance, social interactions are characterized by a [[fission-fusion society]] in which groups of hyenas can form and dissolve on a regular basis.  The greater complexity of the political dynamics among the spotted hyena appears to require a larger [[neocortex]] than in related species with simpler social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain Size and Social Complexity: A Computed Tomography Study in Hyaenidae |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Evolution |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=91–104 |year=2011 |last=Sakai |first=Sharleen |author2=Bradley M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">The '''''Shōtōkan nijū kun''''' ([[Japanese language]]: {{linktext|松|濤|館|二|十|訓}}) are the "twenty instructions" of the [[Okinawan martial arts]] master [[Gichin Funakoshi]], whose [[pen name]] was Shōtō. All students of [[Shōtōkan]] [[karate]] are encouraged to live, practice, and teach the principles to others.&lt;ref name="funakoshi1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gichin Funakoshi | title = The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate | year = 1938 | ISBN = 978-4-7700-2796-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Funakoshi trained in [[Shuri-te]] and [[Naha-te]] from an early age. He ultimately developed [[Shotokan|his style of karate]], which he believed leveraged the benefits of these two. Gaining the attention of a larger audience, Funakoshi later ventured to disseminate his art throughout  [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="funakoshi2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gichin Funakoshi | title = Karate-do: My Way of Life | year = 1975 | ISBN = 0-87011-463-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the ''nijū kun'' to assist his [[karate]]ka in their training.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The precepts are not numbered or ordered; each begins with ''hitotsu'' meaning "one" or "first" to show that each rule has the same level of importance as the others.

The '''Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies''', founded in 1997, is a [[Recognised Independent Centre]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indialink-online.com/index.php?id=367&amp;PHPSESSID=68e319a7042e53fd20b133d072d1f7e4|title=Dispatches &amp; Reports - Dispatches &amp; Reports - August - September 2006|date=|publisher=Indialink Online|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is engaged in developing academic programmes of education, research and publishing in the field of [[Hindu studies]]. The Centre also aims to encourage the Hindu community in the academic study of their own traditions and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotcurry.com/archive/news/2006/ochs.htm|title=News. Peer asks Oxford Scholars to give Hindu View|date=|publisher=Redhotcurry|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'This development in the field of Hindu Studies at Oxford is very exciting. It is an important addition to Oxford's wealth of resources on India and Indian religious traditions. It fits in well with our goal to attract more Indian students to come and study at Oxford. The new official association provides a platform for the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and Oxford University to move forward together in teaching, research and publishing.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2006/060626.html |title=Oxford University establishes formal links with Hindu Centre - University of Oxford |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming of the Centre ==

When founded, the OCHS was for a short time known as the Oxford Centre for Vaishnava and Hindu Studies (OCVHS). The Centre's lean towards [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] traditions was reflective of the fact that its Founding Director, [[Shaunaka Rishi Das]], is a Vaishnava priest. As the Centre grew, it pivoted to become more inclusive and broader in scope regarding Hindu Studies, a decision which resulted in the current name of the OCHS.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aktor|first=Mikael|date=2015|title=Asymmetrical Religious Commitments? Religious Practice, Identity, and Self-Presentation among Western Scholars of Hinduism and Buddhism|url=|journal=Numen|volume=62|pages=265–300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre started out in a suburban house on Divinity Road with only three students and a small library of donated books. It has since moved into a larger office in Madgalen Street, Oxford, with space for student facilities, scholars' rooms, administrative space, and a full-fledged library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iskconnews.org/oxford-centre-for-hindu-studies-campaigns-for-new-home,3635|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Campaigns for New Home|work=ISKCON News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the OCHS, according to Mikael Aktor, has successfully evolved into "a respected and well-known academic institution that hosts research within a broad spectrum of themes related to the study of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Educational programmes==
Most students of the OCHS are members of Oxford colleges and are studying for Oxford degrees from undergraduate to doctoral levels. Students are reading for degrees in the faculties of Theology and Religion, Oriental Studies, History and Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234019/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm|date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the Centre has been inviting scholars to deliver lectures and tutorials at Oxford University. These include recipients of the Shivdasani and J.P. and Beena Khaitain Visiting Fellowships, with the Shivdasani Fellowship sponsoring Indian scholars and the J.P. and Beena Khaitan Fellowship helping scholars from other regions come to Oxford every term.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/OCHS-Academic-Report-2016.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Academic Report 2015–16|last=|first=|date=2016|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these fellowships and student scholarships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeonline.org/financial-assistance/scholarships/hindu-scholarship|title=Hindu Scholarships|date=|publisher=CollegeOnline.org|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre encourages intellectual understanding between cultures of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/as/religiousstudies/alumni/newsletter/faculty-news.php|title=William &amp; Mary - Faculty News|date=2010-11-30|publisher=Wm.edu|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre offers regular lectures and seminars at Oxford, interdisciplinary and broad in their range, including the named Majewski, Wahlstrom and Ford lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/events/lectures/events/oxford_centre_for_hindu_studies?SQ_CALENDAR_DATE=2009-02-05|title=Events &amp;#124; South Asian Studies|date=|publisher=Southasia.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2009-10/weekly/280110/lecs.htm#17Ref|title=Oxford University Gazette, 28 January 2010: Lectures|date=|publisher=Ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Centre's longest-standing exchange programs is with [[Aarhus University]], active nearly every term since October 2014. Dr Bjarne Wernicke-Olsen, an OCHS Fellow, established the [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] with the Aarhus University Department for the Study of Religion that enabled the exchange. Danish visiting students are hosted at the Centre for one or more terms as they further their Sanskrit studies. The Centre has also at times hosted large groups of visiting Aarhus students and served as their meeting place for lectures and readings. In Spring 2016, on one such visit, a group of students came to the OCHS for a two-day seminar on the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Haṭhayogapradīpikā]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Continuing Education Department===
Since 2003, the OCHS Continuing Education Department (CED) has facilitated access to Hindu Studies for adults in the UK - at various locations, and online for a more international audience, making a scholarly approach to the subject available to as wide an audience as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandir.org/news&amp;events/2008/11/OHC/index.htm|title=News &amp; Events – 'Understanding Hindu Identity' – Oxford Hinduism Course for BAPS Volunteers|date=2008-10-11|publisher=Mandir.org|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre's online courses explore Hindu beliefs and practices along with notions of Hindu identity in the lives of modern practitioners. Courses are offered such as "Introduction to Sanskrit", "Hinduism and Sacred Sound: Chant and Music", and "Philosophy of Yoga". The CED consistently develops and releases new courses in conjunction with scholars globally, with 12 courses currently offered and several more in development. The online program's enrollees have steadily increased, with 734 enrolled in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/study-online|title=Study Online|date=2011-12-20|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides online courses, the CED offers day schools and summer schools. Day schools held in London have explored topics such as [[Bhakti]] and the [[Upanishads|Upanisads]] in a condensed format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/speaking-bhakti-day-school-london-20-january|title="Speaking of Bhakti" Day School: London 20 January|date=2018-01-03|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/london-day-school-25-march|title=London Day School on 25 March|date=2017-03-14|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCHS has also organized summer schools every year since 2014, with each spanning around three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ochsonline.org/product/oxford-summer-school-creativity-in-hinduism-june-2018/|title=Oxford Summer School: Creativity in Hinduism 29 June – 1 July 2018|work=Hindu Studies Online|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
The library holds a collection of some 25,000 volumes received mainly by donation concentrating on the study of Hindu culture, religion, languages, literature, philosophy, arts and society. Areas of strength include Sanskrit grammar, poetics, philosophy, theology, comparative theology, and religions studies. The collection reached its present size with major donations from [[Brian Pearce]], UK, Prof. J.A.F. Roodbergen, the Netherlands, [[Tamala Krishna Goswami|Tamal Krishna Goswami]], USA, Prof. M. Narasimhachary, India, Prof. Tuvia Gelblum, UK, Prof. [[Friedhelm Hardy]], UK, H. D. Goswami, USA, and Prof. Joseph T.

==Publishing==
===''Journal of Hindu Studies''===
Since 2008, the Centre has published the [[Journal of Hindu Studies]] in partnership with Oxford University Press. The Journal is fully refereed. The aim of the Journal is to create a forum for critical and constructive interdisciplinary discourse, exploring key questions and meta-issues relating to the developing field of Hindu Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/jhs/pages/About|title=About {{!}} The Journal of Hindu Studies {{!}} Oxford Academic|website=academic.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal currently publishes three issues a year, one guest-edited and one open for submissions. Each issue contains approximately six articles in addition to book reviews, occasional review articles, and reports on work in progress. The third issue usually publishes conference and panel papers. The first two issues are on the same broad annual theme. These themes focus on theoretical meta-issues that are relevant to all fields within Hindu Studies, linking scholars in interdisciplinary dialogue. Themes published to date include: Hermeneutics and Interpretation, Aesthetics and the Arts, and Reason and Rationality. The disciplines represented in the Journal presently include History, Philology, Literature and the Arts, Philosophy, Anthropology, Sociology, Archaeology, and Religious Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jhs.oxfordjournals.org/|title=Oxford Journals &amp;#124; Humanities &amp;#124; Journal of Hindu Studies|date=2013-11-03|publisher=Jhs.oxfordjournals.org|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal is edited by James Madaio, [[Gavin Flood]], [[Jessica Frazier]], and Rembert Lutjeharms.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2017–18|last=|first=|date=June 2018|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindu Studies Book Series ===
The OCHS Hindu Studies book series, has proven to be a successful association with [[Routledge]], the publisher. The series publishes books covering areas of constructive Hindu theological, philosophical and ethical research which aims to bring Hindu traditions into dialogue with contemporary trends in scholarship and contemporary society. This includes annotated translations of important primary sources and studies in the history of the Hindu religious traditions. The series has attracted original, high quality, research level work on religion, culture and society of Hindus living in India and abroad.

The Series Editor is the Centre's Academic Director, Professor Gavin Flood. The previous Series Editor was Professor Francis X. Clooney, SJ, Harvard University, USA, 2003–2005. Professor Clooney served as the Centre's Academic Director from 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/research/routledge_hindu_studies_series_RHSS/|title=Hindu Studies Series (Book Series)|last=Timalsina|first=Sthaneshwar|date=|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeology and Religion in South Asia Series ===
The OCHS, in association with Routledge, also launched the Archeology and Religion in South Asia book series. This series publishes books that tackle questions of South Asian religion and society from the perspective of archaeological evidence. Underpinning the series is an approach that is motivated by close study of inscriptions, iconography, numismatics, and archaeological remains (particularly of shrines and diverse sacred sites). The Series Editor is Professor Himanshu Prabhu Ray, an emeritus professor at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] and a former Shivdasani Visiting Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Archaeology-and-Religion-in-South-Asia/book-series/AR|title=Archaeology and Religion in South Asia - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/publications/archaeology-and-religion-series|title=Archaeology and Religion Series|date=2012-10-11|website=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research projects at OCHS fall under four general headings. The four broad areas are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/OCHS-Trustees-Report-2012.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Trustees Report 2011–12|last=|first=|date=2012|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1. Hinduism and modernity 2. Classical Hinduism 3. Religious dialogue and interface 4. Historical perspectives on Hindu cultures

=== Current research projects ===

==== Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period ====
Project Director: [[Ferdinando Sardella]], Lucian Wong

This project undertakes an interdisciplinary survey of modern Bengali Vaishnavism from the mid-18th century to the mid-20th century. Part of this work involves the mapping, collection, and translation of relevant literature from this period. The six main areas of research in regards to Bengali Vaishnavism are: 1) theology and philosophy, 2) history, 3) transnational currents and the development of modern institutions, 4) case studies and biography, 5) human rights, gender, family, and caste, and 6) theoretical and methodological issues. The project was launched with a workshop at Worcester College (2015) on which a volume was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bengali-vaishnavism-modern-period|title=Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavata Purana Project ====
Project Directors: [[Radhika Ramana Dasa|Ravi M. Gupta]], [[Kenneth Valpey|Kenneth R. Valpey]]

This research project assesses the [[Bhagavata Purana]] together with its context and consolidates past scholarship on the text. It has been remarkably productive so far. Its first phase saw the publication of a volume of research articles entitled 'Bhagavata: The Bhāgavata Purāṇa: Sacred Text and Living Tradition' (2013) as well as the publication of an annotated and abridged translation of the Bhagavata Purana (2016), both by [[Columbia University Press]]. Phase two of the project was marked by a large international conference in Chennai with the University of Madras that brought together the network of scholars in the field. The [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|BORI]] in its partnership with the OCHS has compiled a database of Bhagavata Purana manuscripts and secondary literature and is assessing a critical edition of the text.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bhagavata-purana-research-project|title=Bhagavata Purana Research Project|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/bori-ties-up-with-oxford-centre-for-review-of-bhagvata-purana-edition/|title=BORI ties up with Oxford Centre for review of Bhagvata Purana edition|date=2016-03-12|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shakta Traditions Project ====
Project Directors: Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen, Gavin Flood

The [[Shaktism|Shakta]] Traditions project takes an interdisciplinary approach to investigating Goddess (Devi) worship among the Brahmanical community, in Tantric practices, and at the village level. The project aims to carve out space for the tradition within the Indian religious context by defining its theology, textual lineage, historical evolution, and its relationship to parallel traditions such as [[Shaivism]]. It has produced several international conferences and symposia, such as the international Shakta Traditions conference (2011), as well as numerous conference volumes published by the Oxford University Press and Routledge. In 2018, Bjarne Oleson established a study and research centre for the project in Kathmandu with a focus on manuscript collection and preservation and fieldwork.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2017–18|last=|first=|date=June 2018|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shakta Traditions project resulted from the Memorandum of Understanding between the OCHS and Aarhus University and is run as a collaboration between the two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/projects-2/|title=Projects - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/sakta-traditions|title=The Sakta Traditions|date=2012-06-12|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Goswami Project ====

Project Managers: Kiyokazu Okita, Rembert Lutjeharms

This project investigates the formative period of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] through research into the Sanskrit writings of the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavana|Goswamis]], a group of early followers of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Krishna Chaitanya]] whose works provided the theological underpinning of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. The core of the project involves preparing critical editions and translations of important Goswami texts. Other branches of the project involve study of early Gaudiya Vaishnavism's relation to contemporaneous Vaishnava schools, the theology of authors who inspired the Goswamis, how the Goswamis' teachings were developed by later Vaishnavas, and the material culture of the early Gaudiyas. The project was launched with a two-day workshop entitled 'The Building of Vrindavana' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/gosvami-era|title=The Gosvāmī Era: The Founding of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism in Early Modern South Asia|date=2013-04-04|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===
The OCHS has hosted a number of conferences and symposia characterised by their interdisciplinary approach. These gatherings have dealt with a wide range of topics including, the idea of Desire, Women in Hinduism, Philosophy, Archaeology, temple art and architecture, and Shakta Traditions.

The Shivdasani conferences synthesized the work being done in various projects. The first Shivdasani Conference (2007) was held in Trinity College and was titled ''Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia –'' it helped launch the Centre's Archeology and Text Project. The proceedings of this conference were published by Oxford University Press, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Editor, Himanshu Prabha Ray, Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia, Oxford University Press, India 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second Shivdasani Conference (2009) – ''Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy''– took place at Somerville College. It explored linguistic, aesthetic, and ontological categories as they appear in Indian schools of philosophy, simultaneously bringing these ideas into dialogue with Western methods and launching the Categories in Indian Philosophy research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/conference-2009.pdf|title=Shivdasani Conference 2009 - Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCHS has held several conferences and symposia to help launch and progress the Shakta Traditions project. It held the first international Shakta Traditions conference (2011) with approximately fifty participants and twelve specialist scholars. The conference took an interdisciplinary survey of Shakta history, practice, and doctrine with the aim of exploring the tradition's uniqueness in the context of the Indian religious landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/first-international-sakta-traditions-conference/|title=First International Śākta Traditions Conference 2011 - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also held symposiums on Shakta Traditions in 2017 and in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium-ii/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium II - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to further develop the Bhagavata Purana Project, the OCHS held a conference in Chennai co-hosted by the University of Madras and [[The C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation|C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation]] titled 'The Bhāgavata Purāṇa: History, Philosophy, and Culture' (2017).&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; To officially launch the Gosvami Era Project, a two-day workshop titled 'The Building of Vrindavana' (2017)'','' was held at Oxford.&lt;ref name=":84"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2017–18|last=|first=|date=June 2018|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCHS has also organized conferences dealing with comparative theology - notably a conference on 'Desire in Christianity and Indian Religions' (2007) and a conference on 'Surrender to God in Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/desire-christianity-and-indian-religions-1|title=Desire in Christianity and Indian religions|date=2011-12-12|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2008.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2007–8|last=|first=|date=2008|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outreach projects ===

==== Chaplaincy ====

Shaunaka Rishi Das, the Director of the OCHS,  is the first Hindu Chaplain to the University of Oxford. He regularly meets Hindu and Jain students to offer pastoral guidance.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The OCHS Board of Governors Report 2013-14|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre facilitates HUM, the Oxford University Hindu Society. Shaunaka Rishi also serves as Chaplain at various local hospitals.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre has developed a chaplaincy course for the [[VU University Amsterdam|Free University of Amsterdam]]. It was designed by Dr Nick Sutton and Anuradha Dooney in conjunction with Vineet Chander from Princeton University.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The OCHS Annual Report 2014–15|last=|first=|date=2015|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, they, along with Shaunaka Rishi Das, explored the emerging institution of Hindu chaplaincy in a book titled 'Hindu Chaplaincy: The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Guide'. As discussed in the book, they take interest in the task of translating a conventionally Christian notion of Chaplaincy into Hindu terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindu Chaplaincy: The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Guide|last=Chander|first=Vineet|last2=Sutton|first2=Nicholas|last3=Shaunaka Rishi Das|publisher=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|year=2017|isbn=1999764404|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Bhumi Project ====
The Bhumi Project is one of the OCHS's key outreach programs and aims to mobilize Hindus against climate change globally. It was launched by the OCHS in partnership with the [[Alliance of Religions and Conservation]] in 2009 and with input from the four largest Hindu temples in the UK. Its inauguration was held at Windsor Castle in the presence of Prince Philip and Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The project encourages Hindu communities to develop plans to transform their environmental practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/bhumi_overview.pdf|title=The Bhumi Project|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project uniquely dialogues with these groups by making a case for environmentalism grounded in Hindu scripture, an approach exemplified in its published petition, the "Hindu Declaration on Climate Change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/murali-balaji/a-hindu-call-to-action-in_b_8631290.html|title=A Hindu Call to Action in Fighting Climate Change|last=Balaji|first=Murali|date=2015-11-23|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project then works with them by providing them with resources and the chance to take on over twenty projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Centre helped launch the Bhumi Pledge in 2015, in which it invited students worldwide to make a pledge to care for the environment and organize an environmental awareness event on their campus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Bhumi Project has also facilitated Hindu Environment Week for several years, in which events to raise awareness of environmental issues are held across the world (India, UK, US) - there were over 10,000 global participants in 2015.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Members of the Bhumi Project have participated in panels, conferences (such as the annual [[COP22]] UN climate change negotiations), and interfaith events (such as the 2017 interfaith talks in Delhi with [[Islamic Relief]] and EcoSikh).&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; The Centre has launched with GreenFaith for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hinduclimatedeclaration2015.org/launch_annoucement|title=Launch Annoucement|work=Bhumi Devi Ki Jai!|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Dow Jones Dharma Index ====

In October 2006, after being invited by the Emerging Markets Group (EMG), the OCHS began work with Dow Jones in creating the Dharma Index. This index serves as an investing guide for Hindu and Buddhist communities by integrating dharmic ethical considerations into its investment calculus. The OCHS brought together academics, financial experts, and religious leaders (both Hindu and Buddhist) to form three committees tasked with creating the Index. The final document contains five indices, one each for the global market, USA, India, UK, and Japan. It also contains an overview of dharmic ethical values along with guidelines for their practical application in investment. The Index was launched on 15 Jan 2008 at the Taj Hotel, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/dj_report08.pdf|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies &amp; The Dow Jones Dharma Index: A case study in bridge building|last=|first=|date=2008|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The British Hinduism Oral History Project====
For the first time, the experiences of 300 first generation Hindus who settled in Britain were recorded, transcribed, given a web presence, and archived. This three-year project, launched at the Indian High Commission, London, in 2001, was funded by the Heritage Lottery Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/trs/staff/kim_knott.htm|title=Theology and Religious Studies - Faculty of Arts - University of Leeds|date=|publisher=Leeds.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shalini Sharma, The Life of Hindus in Britain, IIAS Newsletter, Number 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Youth Research Project====

The Hindu Youth Research Project, conducted in 2001, is the first survey of its kind in the UK, developed with the assistance of the Hindu Youth Festival 2001. The results have served to make the concerns and experiences of young British Hindus known to government, media and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Santosh and Savita Vij, The Hindu Youth Research Project 2001, The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, Oxford, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.J.

Santosh (eds) The Hindu Youth Research Project 2001, Oxford, Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, 2003, pp 41-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital Shikshapatri====

This project provides online access to an important part of the British Hindu cultural heritage. The [[Shikshapatri]] manuscript is part of the Sanskrit manuscript collection of Oxford's Bodleian Library. The text was written by [[Swaminarayan|Shree Swaminarayan]], founder of Swaminarayan Hinduism, and is a religious manual for daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Rae A. Earnshaw, John A. Vince, Digital convergence: libraries of the future, Springer-Verlag, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The project aimed at helping people of all backgrounds to better understand the significance of this popular manuscript. The project also proved to be a good example of how scholars and community members successfully worked together for a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/2,6545,15.html|title=Hindu Press International - Vegetarian Journal Poll: Americans 2.3 Percent Vegetarian - Hindu Press International - Hinduism Today Magazine|date=|publisher=Hinduismtoday.com|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a collaborative venture between the OCHS, the Indian Institute Library, and the Refugee Studies Centre of Oxford University, was funded by The New Opportunities Fund, and lasted from 2001-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odl.ox.ac.uk/collections/shikshapatri.htm|title=ODL - Digital Initiatives at Oxford University|date=2004-02-23|publisher=Odl.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships with academic institutions ===

The OCHS has entered into partnerships and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with academic institutions across the world — from India, institutions such as the C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Institute of Indological Research (CPRIIR), the [[University of Madras]], and the [[University of Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cpr-centre-ties-up-with-oxford-centre-for-hindu-studies/article6263511.ece|title=C.P.R. centre ties up with Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|date=2014-07-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-05-18|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2014|title=|url=|journal=University of Madras Newsletter|volume=20|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

The relevance of such partnerships is exemplified by the Centre's partnership with [[Nepal Sanskrit University]] (NSU) and the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]] (BORI). Through the MoU with Nepal Sanskrit University in 2014, the Centre gains access to the National Archive of Nepal's large selection of rare, unedited, and unpublished Sanskrit and Nepali manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/nsu-oxford-university-sign-agreement/|title=NSU, Oxford University sign agreement|date=2018-03-25|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, the BORI's partnership with the OCHS on the Bhagavata Purana Project has led to great strides in the project. The BORI is engaging in a lengthy assessment of the critical edition of the Bhagavata Purana published by the BJ Institute of Learning and Research. In collaboration with the OCHS, they are analyzing the methodology used to put together this critical edition, taking into consideration dozens of other manuscripts, and are finally assessing whether the BJ Institute's critical edition is the most genuine manuscript. Besides this, the team has also researched the living traditions of the Bhagavata Purana in Maharashtra and is creating a collection of data on the text of the Bhagavata Purana and related texts. This work has contributed much to the ongoing phase two of the Bhagavata Purana Project.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The Centre has signed MoUs with places across the globe, including the [[University of Florida]] (UF), the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and Aarhus University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2010.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2009–10|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UF's collaboration with the OCHS inspired the creation of a centre at the University of Florida called the Centre for the Study of Hindu Traditions (CHiTra), paralleling the OCHS in its aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2007.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2006–7|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's MoU with Aarhus University resulted in a program allowing Sanskrit students at Aarhus to spend a semester at the Centre as visiting students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/aarhus-ochs-student-exchange-programme|title=Aarhus-OCHS Student Exchange Programme|date=2014-09-18|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Danish students have taken advantage of this opportunity. The MoU also led the establishment of a new research unit for South Asian Religion (SAR) at Aarhus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These collaborations have proven to be effective ways for the Centre to bring its ideas and approaches to other academic institutions.

The major distinguishing symptom of acquired phonological dyslexia is that a selective impairment of the ability to read pronounceable non-words occurs although the ability to read familiar words is not affected. It has also been found that the ability to read non-words can be improved if the non-words belong to a family of pseudohomophones.&lt;ref name="Derouesne, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dérouesné J, Beauvois MF |title=Phonological processing in reading: data from alexia |journal=J.

==Deep and phonological dyslexia==

Individuals who suffer from phonological dyslexia have the opposite problem to surface dyslexics. These individuals are able to read using the [[Reading education in the United States#Whole Language|whole word method]]. However, they struggle when it comes to [[Reading education in the United States#Phonics|sounding words out]]. Phonological dyslexics are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties when it comes to unfamiliar words or non-words that are pronounceable.&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauvois MF, Dérouesné J |title=Phonological alexia: three dissociations |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1115–24 |date=December 1979 |pmid=533850 |pmc=490427 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.42.12.1115|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that many phonological dyslexics have a good reading ability if the individual has developed a large vocabulary prior to suffering from brain damage. These individuals seem to stop developing their vocabulary post-brain damage, which affects their reading capacity.&lt;ref name="Derouesne, 1979"/&gt;

Phonological dyslexia is a reading disorder in which the patient has impaired reading of nonwords. The symptoms of phonological dyslexia are very similar to those of [[deep dyslexia]]. The major difference between these two dyslexias is that phonological dyslexics do not make semantic errors associated with deep dyslexia. Beauvois and Dérouesné (1979) studied the first case of phonological dyslexia and came up with this term.&lt;ref name="Welbourne"&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|author1=Welbourne S.R.|author2=Lambon Ralph M.A.|contribution= Phonological and Surface Dyslexia in a Single PDP Model of Reading|year=2006|pages=2359&amp;ndash;64|place=Mahwah, New Jersey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2006/docs/p2359.pdf|isbn=9780976831822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem people with phonological dyslexia have is that they are able to read words using the whole word method; however, they are not able to sound words out. This means that they are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties reading new words.

Initially it was believed that the factor causing phonological dyslexia was lexicality; however, other factors such as imageability and concreteness also play a critical role in reading. A study done by Crisp and Lambon Ralph concluded that imageability has a significant effect on phonological dyslexia. The study found that eleven out of the twelve patients had more accuracy when reading words with high imageability.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt; In that study, the patient who was the exception was the least severely damaged, contributing to a view of phonological dyslexia and deep dyslexia as points on a continuum rather than discrete disorders.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt;

==Physiology==
Several studies have found that different levels of [[brain damage]] can lead to the occurrence of varying forms of non-word reading disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, R.S., Hawndiges, A.N., Mitchum, C. C., &amp; Wayland, S.C. (1996). An investigation of nonlexical reading impairments. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 13, 763-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dérouesné, J |author2=Beauvois, M F. |chapter=The "phonemic" state in the non-lexical reading process: Evidence from a case of phonological alexia |editors=Coltheart, Max; Patterson, Karalyn; Marshall, John F. |title=Surface dyslexia: neuropsychological and cognitive studies of phonological reading |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1985 |pages= 399–457 |isbn=0-86377-026-6 |oclc=789357383 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that during certain tasks, dyslexics had activated one of two regions of the brain: the [[Broca's area]], which is responsible for speech, or the [[Wernicke's area]], which is responsible for forming and understanding. Both areas were seldom active together. This study has led to the conclusion that there exist neural connection breakdowns between the language centers that may be causing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lishman WA |title=Developmental dyslexia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1603–5 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14638872 |pmc=1757419 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.74.12.1603|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyphenation==
An investigation conducted by Harley, T. A., and O'Mara, D.A. (2006) found that [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] significantly improved a participant`s reading ability. The subject suffered from phonological dyslexia that was due to a deficiency in graphemic parsing. The study suggested that hyphenation might be generally useful as a strategy to assist phonological dyslexics.&lt;ref name="Harley, O'Mara, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Trevor A. |last2=O'Mara|first2=David A.|title=Hyphenation can improve reading in acquired phonological dyslexia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=20|issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=744–761 |issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/02687030600591658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study==
A study was done by Beauvois and Dérouesné on a 64-year-old man. The individual is described as right-handed, a retiree, and having formerly been an agricultural machinery representative. The individual had had surgery for a left parieto-occipital [[angioma]]. Scans showed a lesion at the left angular gyrus, the posterior part of the second temporal convolution, the [[inferior longitudinal fasciculus]], the geniculostriate fibres and [[tapetum of corpus callosum|tapetum]]. The patient was also found to be suffering from neurological defects such as right inferior quadrantanopia, mild memory deficit, mild calculation impairment, minimal constructional apraxia, and [[astereognosia]]. It was found that the patient did not suffer from motor or sensory defects. He had been obliged to retire as the phonological dyslexia disrupted his ability to work. He had previously enjoyed reading, but was now unable to read his own or other pieces of writing. The diagnosis was confirmed with the Alouette reading test, which concluded that the patient suffered from a reading disability. He was found to have the reading ability of a 6-year-old child, which is considered to be the lowest reading level. The level of reading was not determined from the speed, rather from the fact that the patient was not able to read more than 62 of the stimuli presented in three minutes, while 40% of the represented stimuli were either read incorrectly or left unread. The reading errors included [[adjectives]], [[possessive adjectives]], [[conjunctions]] and [[verbs]].&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"/&gt;

==The dual route cascaded model==
Patients with phonological dyslexia have problem reading non-words and unfamiliar words. According to the dual route model, patients with phonological dyslexia use route 2 or 3 that have intact orthographic input lexicon which allow them to pronounce familiar words whether regular or irregular. However due to phonological dyslexia they are unable to use grapheme-phoneme conversion (Route 1), as route 1 is impaired, thus patients find it difficult to pronounce unfamiliar words and non-words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">'''Plastics engineering''' encompasses the processing, design, development, and manufacture of [[plastic]]s products. A plastic is a [[polymer]]ic material that is in a semi-liquid state, having the property of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] and exhibiting flow. Plastics engineering encompasses plastics material and plastic machinery. Plastic Machinery is the general term for all types of machinery and devices used in the plastics processing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticextrudermachine.com/plastics_engineering.html] Introduction of Plastics Engineering. PlASTICEXTRUDERMACHINE.COM&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of plastic materials poses unique challenges to an engineer. [[Mechanical properties]] of plastics are often difficult to quantify, and the plastics engineer has to design a product that meets certain specifications while keeping costs to a minimum. Other properties that the plastics engineer has to address include: outdoor weatherability, thermal properties such as upper use temperature, electrical properties, barrier properties, and resistance to chemical attack.

In plastics engineering, as in most [[engineering]] disciplines, the [[economics]] of a product plays an important role. The cost of plastic materials ranges from the cheapest [[commodity plastics]] used in [[mass production|mass-produced]] consumer products to the very expensive, specialty plastics. The cost of a plastic product is measured in different ways, and the absolute cost of a plastic material is difficult to ascertain. Cost is often measured in price per pound of material, or price per unit volume of material. In many cases however, it is important for a product to meet certain specifications, and cost could then be measured in price per unit of a property. Price with respect to processibility is often important, as some materials need to be processed at very high temperatures, increasing the amount of cooling time a part needs. In a large production run cooling time is very expensive.

Some plastics are manufactured from re-cycled materials but their use in engineering tends to be limited because the consistency of formulation and their physical properties tend to be less consistent. Electrical and electronic equipment and motor vehicle markets together accounted for 58 percent of engineered plastics demand in 2003.[http://mdmr.net/onesource/catalog/Engineered-Plastics-p-517.html] Engineered plastics demand in the US was estimated at $9,702 million in 2007.

A big challenge for plastics engineers is the reduction of the ecological footprints of their products. First attempts like the [[Vinyloop]] process can guarantee that a product's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The [[global warming potential]] is 39 percent lower. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.solvayplastics.com/sites/solvayplastics/SiteCollectionDocuments/VinyLoop/The%20VinyLoop%20Eco-Footprint%20Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25740">In [[linguistics]], a '''relativizer''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|rel}}''')  is a type of [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] that introduces a [[relative clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Paul|title=Parts-of-speech systems|year=1985|pages=3–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in English, the conjunction ''that'' may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as "I have one that you can use."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Barbara A. and Thompson, Sandra A. (2007) "Relative Clauses in English conversation: Relativizers, frequency, and the notion of construction", Studies in Language, 31 (2), p.&amp;nbsp;293-326(34).&lt;/ref&gt; Relativizers do not appear, at least overtly, in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers, they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases, a "[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]] relativizer" may be present, meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; For example, the word ''that'' can be omitted in the above English example, producing "I have one you can use", using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer.

==Analysis==

Since as far back as 1712, people have written about relativizers and what functions they have.  They have been classified as conjunctions in earlier times, and have later been referred to as clause markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Ralph|title=The Sentence and its Parts|year=1961|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago &amp; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are known today as relativizers. Despite an agreement in nomenclature, there are multiple analyses which attempt to account for the grammatical function and distribution of relativizers.

===Promotional analysis===

The promotional analysis is a transformational analysis from 1973 depicting relative clauses in English, and how relative pronouns are introduced into the embedded clause.  This analysis assumes that there is no overt head noun in the [[deep structure]] of the [[main clause]].  In order to form a relative construction, the noun phrase from the embedded clause is promoted to the empty head of the noun phrase of the main clause.  From there, a corresponding relative pronoun leaves a trace in the space of the vacated noun phrase in the embedded clause.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihalainen|first=Ossi|title=Promotion vs Matching: Two Competing Transformational Analyses of English Relative Clauses|journal=English Studies|year=1981|volume=62|issue=4|pages=371–375|doi=10.1080/00138388108598127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
[[File:Figure 1, Tree displaying Promotional Analysis.jpeg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 1:  Tree displaying Promotional Analysis]]

===Matching analysis===
The Matching Analysis is another type of transformational analysis from the 1970s, which was in competition with the Promotional Analysis at that time.  In this analysis the relative pronoun is introduced into the embedded clause by corresponding or matching to the head noun in the main clause.  This is done by taking the noun phrase from the embedded sentence in the deep structure that matches the head noun in the noun phrase of the main clause, and replacing it with a relative pronoun.  The relative pronoun thus co-references the head noun in the main clause.  Finally, the relative pronoun is moved to the clause-initial position.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"/&gt;  For example:
[[File:Matching Analysis.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 2: Tree displaying Matching Analysis]]

===Ouhallian analysis===

There are two separate phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either the head of a [[complementizer]] phrase (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of a determiner phrase (D-Type Relativizer).  C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase, or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a verb phrase. D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase. English is a language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, as a part of its relativization strategy because "that" can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to a [[Noun Phrase]] or the argument to a Complementizer Phrase. The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts.&lt;ref name="Ouhalla"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouhalla|first=Jamal|title=Semitic Relatives|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=288–300|doi=10.1162/002438904323019084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[File:DtypeRelativizer.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 4: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Noun Phrase]]
|}

Conversely, Arabic uses two phonologically distinct morphemes to account for these syntactic phenomena. In the same sentences in a D-Type language like Arabic, each example would employ the use of a different morpheme as shown in examples 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref name=Ouhalla/&gt;

 1) ''paris '''lli''' bħibba
    ''Paris '''RM''' I.love.it'''''
    The Paris '''that''' I love

 2) ''xabbaret-na laila '''ʔenno''' l-mmaslin mʔadrabiin
    ''told-us laila '''that''' the-actors on.strike''
    Laila told us '''that''' the actors are on strike.''

==In modern English==

There are three types of relativizers used in English to introduce relative clauses: zero or null relativizers, ''wh''-relativizers, and the ''that''-relativizer.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;Sag, Ivana A. 1997. “[https://www.academia.edu/download/31190371/10.1.1.51.7483.pdf English relative clause constructions]”. Journal of linguistics. 33 (2), p. 431-483. DOI: 10.1017/S002222679700652X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative distribution of null and overt relativizers===

'''Relativizers''' have been analyzed to be optional in certain languages and are variably omitted in the English language.  Such relativizer omission, or use of the null or zero variant of relativizers, does not pattern uniformly in English and has been predicted to be conditioned and constrained by a number of linguistic and social factors.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Stephen and Hill, Carolyn. (2013). “Social and Linguistic Constraints on Relativizer Omission in Canadian English”, American Speech, 88 (1), p. 32-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These social factors and the potential influence of age, gender, and education have been minimally explored and seem to exhibit a lesser effect on relativizer omission.  [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] constraints, such as sentence structure and [[syntax|syntactic]] position of the relativizer, [[clause|main clause]] construction type, lexical specificity of the head NP, type of antecedent, and the adjacency, length, and grammatical subject of the [[relative clause]] have been implicated as having more significant influence on the patterning of relativizer omission in Canadian English.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The omission of relativizers tends to occur more frequently in conversation than in formal writing.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with subject and object relative clauses====
The syntactic position or function of the relativizer in the relative clause is a major determiner for the choice of relative marker.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The null relativizer variant is more common in object than subject relative clauses.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;
 3) ''I have friends '''that''' are moving in together.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (subject)
 4) ''That's one thing '''that''' I actually admire very much in my father.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (direct object)
 5) ''Everyone's kinda used to the age group '''[Ø]''' they work with.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (object of preposition)

====Informational content of the main clause determines distribution====
There is a preference for null relativizers when a [[clause|main clause]] that is informationally light is directly ''adjacent'' to the [[relative clause]].&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 6) ''It's just kinda something '''[Ø]''' I noticed recently.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 7) ''They get values and stuff like that from church '''that''' they might not get at home.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
In this example, the main clause 'it's just kinda something' provides little [[semantics|semantic]] information and it is adjacent to the relative clause 'I noticed recently'.  As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with empty head noun phrases====
Empty head [[noun phrase]]s, which are not lexically specific and which index generic groups or sets, have been correlated with the use of the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  Examples of empty noun phrases include words like ''all'', ''way'', ''time'', etc.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;
 8) ''All '''[Ø]''' she wants to do is sleep.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 9) ''She held onto all those jewelry boxes '''that''' everybody made for her when we were kids.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

Unique head [[noun phrase]]s, which include [[superlative]]s and [[noun]]s with the words ''only'' and ''first'', also take the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 10) ''That's the only place '''[Ø]''' you can go at night.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 11) ''That's the first compliment '''[Ø]''' I've got in a long time.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 12) ''That was the worst job '''[Ø]''' I ever had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 13) ''You have a home here '''that''' you could rent.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

====Length of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Longer head [[noun phrase]]s often co-occur with an overt relativizer, whereas shorter noun phrases are more likely to co-occur with a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 14) ''This pair of suede pants '''that''' I got.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 15) ''The weight '''[Ø]''' I should be at.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
In these examples, the first sentence contains a longer noun phrase ('This pair of suede pants') in comparison to the second sentence, which contains a very short noun phrase ('The weight').  Thus, it is observed that the sentence containing the longer noun phrase also contains the relativizer 'that', whereas the sentence with the shorter noun phrase has a null relativizer.

====Definiteness of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Null relativizers have been found to be correlated to the definiteness of the nominal antecedent.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 16) ''I don't think you have the dedicated teacher '''that''' I had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 17) ''And it was a guy '''[Ø]''' she worked with for a few years.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
The first sentence contains a definite noun phrase, whereas the second sentence contains an indefinite noun phrase which co-occurs with the null relativizer.

====Distribution with relative clause pronominal subjects====
When the grammatical subject of a relative clause is a pronoun, it is more likely that the relativizer will be omitted.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  When the subject of a relative clause is a full noun phrase, the overt relativizer will be retained.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 18) ''I have two cats '''[Ø]''' I'd like to turn in to the Humane Society.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 19) ''Do you remember exactly the road '''[Ø]''' I'm talking about?&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 20) ''That was one of the things '''[Ø]''' he did when he was living elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 21) ''I always go to my girlfriends 'cause there's stuff '''that''' your parents just don't need to know.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''

===Distribution of overt English relativizers===
{{Main|English relative clauses}}
The overt relativizers of Modern English include the words '''“which”''', '''“what”''', '''“when”''', '''“where”''', '''“who”''', '''“whom”''' and '''“whose”''', and these can be referred to within linguistics as "''wh''-words". These are officially classified as [[relative pronouns]], but can be referred to as “''wh''-relativizers” in instances where their function is to introduce a [[relative clause]].
The other overt relativizer of Modern English is the word '''“that”''', which can be referred to as the “''that''-relativizer” where it introduces a relative clause. There is some debate as to whether to classify it as a relative pronoun - like the wh-words, a [[subordinating conjunction]], or a [[complementizer]].&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt; The distribution of the different types of English relativizers varies depending on several factors.

====Fused relative clauses====
Fused relative clauses, sometimes referred to as “free” relative clauses, are different from most other types of relative clauses in that there is no nominal antecedent to which the relative clause refers. In many cases, the relativizers of English are relative pronouns, meaning that they are in [[coreference]] with a noun that precedes them in the sentence. This nominal function is “fused” with the relative clause in free relatives, and this leaves the relativizer without an overt entity to which it can refer. For example:
 22) ''I wonder '''what''' inspired them&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 23) ''I wonder '''whose''' dog died&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
There is no noun preceding the relative clause in these cases, and that is why it is said that this noun’s function is “fused” with the relative clause.

====Grammatical function of the relativized nominal determines relativizer case form====
Where there are different [[grammatical case]] forms of a relativizer, the case form that surfaces will depend on the [[grammatical function]] of the noun that appears previously in the sentence to which the relative clause refers, known as the nominal antecedent. The only examples in Modern English of this phenomenon are the forms “who” and “whom”. “Who” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the main clause, and “whom” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is an [[object (grammar)|object]] of the main clause. However, speaker judgments vary as to whether it is grammatical for "who" to surface when it is referring to an object of the main clause. Since, depending on speaker judgments, either only "whom" or both "who and "whom" can grammatically introduce a relative clause referring to an object, there is an "m" in brackets on the end of the relativizer in example (21) below.
* Subject antecedent
 24) ''The person '''who''' visited Kim&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Object antecedent
 25) ''The chairman listened to the student '''who(m)''' the professor gave a low grade to&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Fred R. and Bell, Lawrence and Nelson, Diane. "On the generalization of relative clause instruction in the acquisition of English as a second language", Applied Linguistics. (1988), 9 (1), p. 1-20. DOI: 10.1093/applin/9.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;''

====Animacy of the antecedent determines distribution====
Only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to human antecedents, and similarly, only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to non-human antecedents. “Who”, “whom”, and “whose” can only refer to human antecedents, “which”, and “what” can only refer to non-human antecedents. “That”, however, can refer to both human and non-human antecedents. To exemplify: 
* Human antecedent
 26) ''The Pat '''that''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 27) ''The Pat '''who''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 28) ''The only person '''that''' I like '''whose''' kids Dana is willing to put up with is Pat&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Non-human antecedent
 29) ''Every essay '''that''' she's written '''which''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 30) ''Every essay '''which''' she's written '''that''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''

====Restrictiveness of the relative clause determines distribution====
Restrictive relative clauses add extraneous information that is not vital for the listener or reader’s understanding of which aforementioned noun is being referenced; or in other words, which noun is the nominal antecedent. Both ''wh''-relativizers and the ''that''-relativizer can be used to introduce restrictive relative clauses. Nonrestrictive relative clauses have [[semantic]] properties which make them necessary to prevent the sentence from being ambiguous. They are used in cases where the context that surrounds the sentence is not sufficient for the distinction between the potential nominal antecedents. Commas mark nonrestrictive relative clauses, and only the ''wh''-relativizers can be used to introduce them. To exemplify:
* Restrictive sentences:
 31) ''He has four sons '''that''' became lawyers &lt;ref name="bache"&gt;Bache, Carl and Jakobsen, Leif K. (1980) "On the distribution between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses in modern English", Lingua, 52 (2), p. 243-267&lt;/ref&gt;''
 32) ''The soldiers '''who''' were brave ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
* Nonrestrictive sentences:
 33) ''He has four sons, '''who''' became lawyers&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
 34) ''The soldiers, '''who''' were brave, ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''

====Finiteness of the relative clause determines distribution====
In non-finite clauses (clauses in which the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears as an object of preposition, or in other words, directly after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a “prepositional phrase”; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example:
 35) A yard in '''which''' to have a party&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 36) The baker in '''whom''' to place your trust&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 37) A student *'''who''' to talk to us just walked in&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
Note that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase.

==Examples in other languages==

===Indonesian Teochew===
[[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] is a [[Chinese language]] originating from the [[Chaoshan]] region of the eastern Guangdong province.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"&gt;{{cite thesis | degree= Ph.D. |first= Annie |last= Peng |title= Aspects of the Syntax of Indonesian Teochew |publisher= University of Delaware |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian Teochew refers to the Teochew dialect spoken in [[Indonesia]]. The most common way to form relative clauses in Indonesian Teochew is to use the relativizer ''kai''. These relative clauses can appear head-finally or head-initially.

====Jambi Teochew====
[[Jambi]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the province of Jambi on the island of [[Sumatra]]. In this language, the relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. In these relative clauses, the ''kai'' is obligatory. This relativizer comes from the Chinese language. The relativizer ''yang'' is optional, and is borrowed from [[Malay language|Malaysian]]. The relativizer ''kai'' must always follow the modifying clause. If the optional relativizer ''yang'' is used, it would precede the modifying clause, as shown by example #43. If the relativizer ''kai'' is not present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, regardless of whether ''yang'' is present or not.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; This is demonstrated in example #45.

 38) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 39) '''''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 40) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 41) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit child cry 
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Another way of forming relative clauses in Jambi Teochew is through using the classifier. The main difference between the ''kai'' and classifier relative clause is that there is the presence of a classifier in the classifier relative clause.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier in classifier relative clauses can only appear head-initially.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier agrees with the head noun type and is in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 42) ''ka Aling '''kai''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling '''REL''' dog very big CL.
       ‘The dog that bit Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 43) ''ka Aling '''tsiaʔ''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling CL dog very big CL. 
       ‘The dog that big Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Headless relative clauses do not have a pronounced head.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; It is the equivalent of “the one” in English. Headless relative clauses are formed with the relativizer ''kai''.  The Malaysian relativizer ''yang'' can be used optionally before the modifying clause.

 44) ''[zazik khau '''kai'''] si zi su m ui.''
       yesterday cry '''REL''' COP this CL one.
       ‘The one who cried yesterday is this one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

The relativizer ''kai'' is obligatory.  In addition, it is not possible to form a headless relative clause with a classifier in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 45) ''zi pung phou si [Aling sia '''kai'''].''
       this CL book COP Aling write '''REL'''.
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’

 46) ''*zi pung phou si [Aling sia pung].''
       this CL book COP Aling write CL
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

==== Pontianak Teochew ====
[[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the capital city of Pontianak in the province of [[West Kalimantan]]. The relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. It is obligatory in head-final relative clauses. If ''kai'' is not present in the sentence, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, as demonstrated by example #52. Pontianak Teochew does not allow the use of the Malaysian relativizer ''yang''. When this relativizer is present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. This is shown in example #53.

 47) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 48) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 49) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

===Ute===
[[Colorado River Numic language|Ute]] is a language that belongs to the Northern Division of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family that spans the distance from the Rocky Mountains to Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City.

In Ute, relative clauses that modify the subject are introduced in a different manner than those that modify the object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather [[nominalization]] and [[Grammatical case|case]] morphology are used to introduce relative clauses.

For example, nominalizing suffixes are attached to verbal elements in subject relative clauses.

 50) '''áapachi 'u [sivaatuchi 'uway paqha-puga-tu]''
      boy.SU 3s.SU  goat.O    3s.O  kill-REM-NOM
      The boy who killed the goat

In relative clauses that are introduced as arguments to an object, the verbal elements are inflected with nominalizing morphology similar to that of their subject relative clause counterparts and the subject of the embedded clause is inflected with the [[genitive]] case.

 51) ''po'oqwatu 'uru [na'achichi 'uway po'o-na]-y punikya-qha-n''
       book.O    the.O girl.GEN  3s.GEN write-NOM-O see-ANT-1s
       I saw the book that the girl is writing

'''Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam''' are academic discourses by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoreticians about [[Islam]], its origins and development based on [[historical materialism]] and [[Muslims]]. The central question of this discourse was how Muslim society would fit into the general [[World History|development of human history]]. Prominent Soviet [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] include Mikhail A. Reisner, Evgenii Beliaev, Liutsian I. Klimovich, Mikhail L. Tomara, V. Ditiakin and Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Discourse on the Origin and
Class Character of Islam, 1923-1933"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/dwi/2009/00000049/00000001], Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[October Revolution]] brought the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to power. The Soviet Union had a large [[Islam in the Soviet Union|Muslim population]] of various ethnicities. Therefore, there was a pressing need for original research as [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_02.htm], Marx To Engels In Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_06.htm], Engels To Marx In London.&lt;/ref&gt; only dealt with the subject superficially. In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks created new institutions and organizations intended to produce devoted Marxist scholars of Oriental studies. Foremost among them was the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies|Moscow Institute for Oriental Studies]], a [[Communist Party|party]] school created in 1920 mainly for the requirements of the Soviet foreign service. Its counterpart for educating party workers and administrators from the Eastern regions and republics of Russia and the USSR, as well as for training communists from abroad, was the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|Communist University of the Toilers of the Orient]], a school founded in 1921. The new Marxist discourse on Islam was dominated by scholars from these political teaching and research institutions.

==Communist theory of Islam==
In 1923, Zinatullah Navshirvanov (a Volga Tatar communist who was also active in the formation of a communist party in Atatürk's new Republic of Turkey) in the journal Novyi Vostok&lt;ref&gt;“Kommunisticheskie techeniia v istorii musul’manskoi kul’tury”, in: Novyi Vostok No. 4 (1923), 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that there were several forms of communism in Islamic history. The authors detected a “primitive communism” already in the activities of some of [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]], but they found that communism was even more prominent in the tradition of Islamic [[Sufism]]. Under the cover of Sufism communist ideas and movements emerged that had nothing to do with Islam and religion whatsoever. These movements were driven by Muslims—poor [[nomad]]s as well as [[peasant]]s and [[Artisan|urban craftsmen]]—longing to overthrow the [[Feudalism|feudal order]] of their times, i.e., the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljukid]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dynasties]] in the [[Near East]]. As examples the Navshirvanovs mentioned the [[Shiism|Shiʿi]] [[Ismailism|Ismailites]], the Anatolian Futūwa and Akhī organizations, and the [[Bektashi|Bektashi order of dervishes]]. The climax of this supposed anti-feudal Sufi communist movement was [[Sheikh Bedreddin]] of Simavna who was executed by the Ottomans in 1416 as a heretic; his disciples led peasant rebellions against Ottoman rule and set up what the Navshirvanov called the “first revolutionary government of Anatolia”.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Navshirvanovy, “Kommunisticheskie techeniia”, 276-278 ff. Cf. Ahmet N. Cerrahoğlu, Şeyh Bedreddin ve Türkiye’de sosyalizm hareketleri (Istanbul, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory suffered from lack of sufficient historical evidence and was superseded by other theories.

==Trade capitalism theory==
Mikhail A. Reisner (Michael von Reusner, 1868–1928), ethnic German historian of law and publicist produced a detailed Marxist analysis of the [[Koran]] from the perspective of [[social studies]]. His interpretation of Islam can be found in two articles on “The Koran and Its Social Ideology”, published in 1926 in a Soviet literary journal.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reisner, “Koran i ego sotsial’naia ideologiia”, part I, in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol.8, 134-149; continuation as part II in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol. 9, 146-164. were later included in his comparative book on “Eastern Ideologies”: M. Reisner, Ideologii vostoka: Ocherki vostochnoi teokratii (Moscow; Leningrad, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies Reisner maintained that Islam was the religion of the Arab merchants of [[Mecca]]. He distinguished between the big merchants, that is, the rich families of Mecca, and the less affluent and poor merchant families. Due to the disunion of the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], [[Trade route|trade caravans]] were constantly running the risk of being raided by nomads. These [[Convoy|caravan]]s were organized as joint ventures of rich and less affluent trade families of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe, but the poorer merchants invested, and therefore risked, a higher percentage of their capital than the rich families. For this reason the idea of a union of the [[Arab tribes]] under one [[monotheism|monotheistic religion]] was developed by the poorer families of the Quraysh, for only such a union would eliminate the raids. Their speaker became Muhammad, who himself hailed from one of the [[Banu Hashim|less privileged Quraysh clans]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 135f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner maintains that the Koran portrayed [[Allah]] as "a rich, powerful and smart [[Capitalism|capitalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 140ff.; for God as “the mighty heavenly capitalist” see ibid., 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medina]], Muhammad acted not so much as a prophet and preacher but as a skillful organizer. He was successful not because people were eager to join a new religion but because they longed for a [[Sharia|law]] that would unite them.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran, Reisner continues, only guarantees the [[right to property]] and creates a “World Trade Company of Believers” (mirovaia torgovaia kompaniia veruiushchikh) under God's own leadership. Many elements in the Koran reflect a merchant's position: the prayers and rituals are not very complex and do not require “spiritual contortions”; the [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca ([[ḥajj]]) is linked to a trade fair; [[tithe]]s ([[zakāt]]) is restricted to a moderate level, and believers are exhorted not to squander their money; while [[riba|usury]] is forbidden, Muslims are encouraged to make moderate profits; and, of course, the Koran emphasizes the importance of oaths, correct measurements, and the faithful return of the deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner explains that mystical elements, which tended to supersede the clear class distinctions, were to enter Islam only much later, mainly stemming from the Persian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner's interpretation turned out to be very influential among Soviet scholars of the late 1920s.

===Beliaev’s modification of trade capitalism theory===
Evgenii Beliaev (1895–1964) was the only professional trained in Oriental languages among all participants in the early Soviet discourse on Islam. In his contribution to the 1930 special issue of ''Ateist'' on the origins of Islam, Beliaev argued that Islam emerged from the merchant environment of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala v istorii proiskhozhdeniia islama”, in: Ateist no. 58 (November 1930), 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagan religion served the purpose of trade, and the authority of the gods in the [[kaaba]] grew with the wealth of the merchants. Islam emerged in the late 6th century as a movement of the less wealthy, “intermediary and lower Meccan bourgeoisie” against this “‘aristocracy’ of avaricious traders and pitiless usurers.”&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Reisner, however, Beliaev did not see anything progressive, liberating, or even revolutionary in this initial Islam: for instance, Islam did not stand up against slavery. Beliaev compared the image of God in the Koran to that of a despot and slave owner.&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 51, 55, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beliav, a similar struggle was taking place in Medina, where some clans became dependant upon others, and especially upon the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|clans]], whose wealth was based on “[[Usury|usury capital]]” (rostovshchicheskii kapital). The gradual dissolution of the ancient tribal and clan structures in Muslim Medina must not be ascribed to the religion of Islam but rather to the development of Meccan trade capital, and in general to the transition to private property in slaves, cattle, and other possessions. “With an eagerness and love for detail that is characteristic for the petty bourgeoisie, the boring, depressing and dull Suras of the Medinan period lay down the regulations for property and inheritance as well as buying and selling”.In Medina Muhammad changed the [[qibla|prayer direction]] from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca; “praying to the Muslim God, they bow down before the only god that they respect, namely capital.” When the “medium wealthy” traders finally took over Mecca, they reached their goal: together with the rich “Quraysh of the Center” they found themselves at the helm of the “trade capitalist organization of the Hijaz” which eventually united the tribes of Arabia. The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Beliaev's scenario; after Muhammad's death they easily committed [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and had to be forced back to Islam by the first caliph, [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 58ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ditiakin==
V. Ditiakin, an expert on the history of Marxism, took as his starting point the works of Marx and Engels instead of Islamic tradition, nor Western Oriental studies or even Reisner. Ditiakin conceded that Marx and Engels had only limited sources at their disposal and never devoted a special study to Islam; nevertheless he believed they came to important insights on this topic.

According to Ditiakin, Marx and Engels understood that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] was characterized by two different environments, that of nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and that of settled urban traders. As the correspondences of the two thinkers show, the Bedouins could hardly be characterized as bearers of high culture, whereas the population of the southwestern Arabian peninsula was a “civilized” Oriental high culture. Obviously, Engels had access to publications on [[petroglyphs]] from [[Yemen]], which, in his mind, reflected “the ancient, national Arabic tradition of monotheism”. However, in the centuries immediately before Muhammad the old culture of Yemen was destroyed by incursions of the [[Ethiopia]]ns, and consequently also the Arabian trade route to the north via Mecca was in decay. This decline of trade in the period before Muhammad was, as Engels wrote to Marx in 1853, “one of the chief factors in the Muhammadan revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 82, referring to Engels’ letter to Marx of June 6, 1853; see Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895: A Selection with Commentary
and Notes (New York: International Publishers, without date [1934?]), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote Engels again, “it seems that Mohammad’s religious revolution, like ''every'' religious movement, was ''formally a reaction'', an alleged return to the old, the simple”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels’ letter to Marx, May 1853; cf. Marx and Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895, 64; emphasis in the original)&lt;/ref&gt; “the movement [of Muhammad] has seemed to me to have the character of a Bedouin reaction against the settled but degenerate fellahin of the towns, who at that time had also become very decadent in their religion, mingling a corrupt nature-cult with corrupt Judaism and Christianity.” The decline referred to by Engels was thus economic and religious.

According to Ditiakin, Engels’ statements led to the apparent contradiction that the uncivilized Bedouins, who were defeated and driven out of their country by foreign invaders, created an “[[Ideology|ideological system]]” that would ultimately rescue Arabia and soon rule over
a huge part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ditiakin's mind, this apparent contradiction can only be solved by the following line of reasoning: The cradle of Islam was characterized by a coexistence of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins and the formerly highly developed trade economy of the “[[fellah|urban fellahs]]”, which was however in decline, but still “potentially” stronger than the Bedouin culture. A series of “revolutionary blows” was necessary to dissolve the contradictions between the two, and to free the trade formation from its restrictions. These blows came in the form of foreign invasions, as Engels had
suggested in 1853: “The expulsion of the [[Habesha people|Abyssinia]]ns took place about forty years before Mohammed and was obviously the first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness, which was also spurred by Persian invasions from the North, pushing forward almost to Mecca”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels to Marx, June 6, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ditiakin, Islam had a Bedouin character, and Bedouin lifestyle had a huge impact on the new religion. Due to the course of the Islamic expansion, however, the emergent religion of Islam was soon adapted to the foundations of urban economy. Accordingly, Islam eliminated the relics of the clan-based society and became the ideology of an urban society. The old nomadic and Bedouin cultural heritage of Islam, however, turned out to be strong enough to prevent Islam from becoming dominant in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 85f.&lt;/ref&gt; Ditiakin came to the conclusion that Muhammad's fight against the Quraysh of Mecca was “a revolution of the dying Bedouin culture against developing trade capital”—seemingly the exact contrary to Reisner's trade capitalism theory.

==Bedouin theory==
Another interpretation of the role of the Bedouins was brought forward by the Kazakh communist and historian Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov (1889–1938).&lt;ref&gt;For his biography see R.V. Suleimenov, “Vidnyi deiatel’ sotsialisticheskogo stroitel’stvav Srednei Azii i Kazakhstane, uchenyi-vostokoved”, in: Sandzhar Dzhafarovich Asfendiarov (Alma-Ata, 1990), 3-26; M. Makhmudov, “Partiino-gosudarstvennaia deiatel’nost’ S.D. Asfendiarova v Turkestane”, in: ibid., 44-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, during his brief directorate of the Moscow Oriental Institute, Asfendiarov published his first booklet on the “Reasons for the Emergence of Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Asfendiarov, Materialy k izucheniiu istorii vostoka. Chast’ pervaia: Prichiny vozniknoveniia islama (Samarkand, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asfendiarov regarded Islam as the product not of the merchants of Mecca, as Reisner did, but of the Arab nomads. To him, the Islamic expansion was a huge emigration wave of about one million nomads from the [[Hijaz]] and [[Najd]] regions of Arabia to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Asfendiarov maintained that Islam emerged as the last huge expansion of Semite tribes from Arabia. However, Asfendiarov insisted that this expansion resulted from changes in the nomadic economy, not from climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, the Arabs were beyond the formation of “primitive patriarchal nomadism”; rather, they possessed a “developed”, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land for cattle breeding. The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation of Central Arabia, as well as in a heightened competition for the available pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 15, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this scarcity and competition, Arab tribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, therefore turned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 17, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all of these reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia constituted more than just a primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or “semi-agriculturalists”, as Asfendiarov had it,&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a “residue” (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very functional element necessary for survival in all three economic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 29f.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribal formation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 5ff., 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, in Asfendiarov's mind, was nothing but the event that triggered off the social expansion of the Arab tribes, uniting the tribes to break the isolation of Arabia. It was an “unconscious impulse”, an “almost secondary reason” for the movement of the tribes. Islam should therefore be understood as an economic movement of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 28, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Asfendiarov strongly criticized Reisner's view that Islam embodied the interests of the Meccan traders.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 20, 24, 39-43, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant theory==
A completely new interpretation of the rise of Islam was brought
forward by the economist Mikhail L. Tomara. Tomara's article in the Ateist special issue of 1930, entitled “The
Origin of Islam and Its Class Basis”,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama i ego klassovoe osnovanie”, in: Ateist, no. 58
(November 1930), 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; points at the role of peasants
and agriculture in 7th-century Arabia. Tomara listed up a vast
number of witnesses, taken partly from al-Ṭabarī (d. 923), but
mostly from European travellers like Niebuhr, Burton and Palgrave,
and especially from Aloys Sprenger's ''Das Leben und Werk des Mohammed''
(1861–1865), showing that Arabia's agricultural and horticultural
population vastly exceeded its Bedouin population, not to speak of
the merchants.

In Tomara's mind, agriculture was mainly taken up
by impoverished Bedouins; under the general climate change in
Arabia, Bedouins whose pastures dried up would either emigrate or, when the emigration was blocked as was the case before Islam,
dig wells and settle down to pursue agriculture with the help of
artificial irrigation. The continuous transformation of pasture land
into fields led to an intensified struggle between the Bedouins and
the peasant population. Tomara assumed that the agriculturalists
consisted mainly of clients (''mawālī'', sing. ''mawla'') of powerful
clans, manumitted slaves and other dislocated people. Poor agriculturalists
would become dependent on usurers and often lose their
house, land, and cattle, thus being forced to work as hired pastors
(Russ. ''batraki'') for rich neighbors. Tomara thus distinguished three
“classes”: nomads, well-to-do peasants, and impoverished peasants
who lived a semi-transhumant or even transhumant life (obviously,
while herding the Bedouins’ cattle).&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, he provided no source for his assumption that impoverished peasants sold their labor as pastors.

Tomara further maintained that trade was only slightly developed
in 7th-century Arabia, and therefore Islam cannot be credited to it:
“Islam was born in the trade city of Mecca, but only as an expression
of the dissatisfaction of the poor strata of the city; and it turned
out to be unsuccessful there. Trade capital, as a fierce opponent of
Islam, defeated Islam and drove it out of Mecca”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47; cf. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently,
Islam found a solid class basis in Medina, an exclusively agricultural
town. The Koran's endorsement of charity, so Tomara, the use of
alms to support the poor, to manumit slaves, and to relieve debtors
from their financial burdens, shows clearly that Islam emerged as
the religion of the urban poor. The poor emigrants (muhājirūn) from
Mecca joined the urban poor of Medina and broke the power of
the rich Medinan landowners who had opposed Muhammad at
several occasions. As indicated in Koran 59:7, Muhammad allotted
agricultural lands in and around Medina to his poor supporters as
well as to people who flocked to him from other agricultural communities
in Arabia. The increasing need to reward peasant supporters
led to the expulsion, and later annihilation, of the Jewish clans of Medina, for they held the best arable land in and around the oasis.
By contrast, Muhammad did not invest much energy into the fight
against the Quraysh, for there was no peasant land to gain from
dry Mecca; the few famous battles like Badr (in 624) were mere
skirmishes, and the later battle at Uhud and the Meccan siege of
Medina show that Muhammad was clearly on the defensive against
his hometown. Tomara found support for his “peasant theory” in
the Koran; its ban of interest, in his mind, expressed the interests
of agriculturalists who suffered from exploitation by usurers. Also,
he suggested that the Koranic inheritance laws reflect the ongoing
splitting-up of agricultural land in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 29ff., 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Tomara's
scenario; they were unreliable as warriors,75 and they accepted Islam
only superficially. Also, “if Islam was the religion of the nomadic
cattle-breeders, then Paradise would have been depicted [in the
Koran] as infinite steppes of high grass, similar to the way how
American Indians imagined their reward in the Hereafter as hunting
grounds in prairies with plenty of bisons and other wild animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in the War of Apostasy (ridda) after Muhammad's death
the Bedouin tribes tried to reclaim the pasture lands they had lost
to the poor Medinans and to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But this rebellion was
crushed by Abū Bakr, and the nomads found themselves forced to
emigrate. As both the Sassanid and the Byzantine empire were now
in political and economical disarray, the Bedouins found an easy
outlet by emigration to Persia, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In result, and
somewhat surprisingly, the Islamic expansion under the first caliphs
was mainly undertaken by nomads driven out of their territories by
Islam itself. Thus, in its beginnings Islam was the ideology of the
peasants, and only later, under the Abbasids after 750, did Islam
become “the ideology of trade capital in the form of Mu’tazilism, and the ideology of the feudal classes of Persia in the form of
Shi’ism.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomara's interpretation thus does not ignore the role of nomadic
Bedouins and urban traders, and even assigns them meaningful roles
in the emergence and spread of Islam. Their functions, however,
were mainly defined in the negative. Because Tomara
pointed out the crucial role of the poor agriculturalists in and around
the towns, his concept would be regarded by his opponents as a
mere “peasant theory”.

==Klimovich==
Liutsian I. Klimovich (1907–1989), in his first major scholarly article, entitled “On the Origin of
Islam”,&lt;ref&gt;published 1927 in Ateist&lt;/ref&gt; made references to a
considerable number of Western Orientalists (like Dozy, Nöldeke,
Muir, Weil, von Kremer, Lammens, and Sprenger) and largely followed Mikhail Reisner's theory that Islam emerged from Meccan trade
capitalism. The opposition of the poor merchant families was directed
against the rich clans and their pagan cult at the kaaba. This opposition
manifested itself first in the movement of the Arab Hanif
monotheists which was later to develop into Islam. Klimovich maintained
that this movement was originally atheist, progressive and
revolutionary in character; when Muhammad became its figurehead
the movement took on religious traits, yet without losing its progressive
character right away.&lt;ref&gt;L. Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, in: Ateist, No. 18, April 1927,
52-63, here: 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hijra to Medina Muhammad
turned into a dexterous politician for whom Islam was nothing but
a means to gain power. Similarly, the Arab tribes that joined the
movement were only interested in booty, not in religion. After a
series of battles the reactionary merchants of Mecca decided to
embrace the new religion, because they understood that Islam would
provide them with a new instrument for ruling over the Arab tribes.
It is at the hands of these rich merchant families, according to
Klimovich, that Islam finally turned from a revolutionary movement
into an instrument for oppression and spiritual enslavement of the
Muslim masses.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, 61ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that with his insistence on the “progressive” character of early Islam Klimovich intended to develop a new and specific strategy for anti-Islamic propaganda, one that would pull the carpet from underneath the believers’ feet.
After graduating in 1929 Klimovich returned to his hometown
Kazan, where he was a member of the local branch of the League
of the Militant Godless (Soiuz Voinstvuiushchikh Bezbozhnikov, SVB).&lt;ref&gt;On the SVB see the study of Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of
the Militant Godless (Ithaca; London, 1998), which, however, does not take into consideration
atheist propaganda work among the Muslim populations of the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year he published his first two books. In Sotsialisticheskoe
stroitel’stvo na vostoke i religiia,&lt;ref&gt;“The Socialist Construction in the
East and Religion”, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich maintained that the Muslim
periphery of the Soviet Union was witnessing an ongoing revival of
Islam. Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, reformist
mullahs tried to convince the Muslim masses that Islam was perfectly compatible with socialism.

Klimovich warned that this was a deception,
for socialism was based on Marxism, [[materialism]], and the
[[Hegel|dialectical method]], and diametrically opposed to religion and its
[[idealism]]. Atheist propagandists, however, were often helpless in their
discussions with the believers. What Klimovich considered necessary,
therefore, was basic information on Islam for the anti-religious
activist. This was the purpose of his second book of 1929, Soderzhanie
korana (“The Contents of the Koran”).&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana. S predisloviem i pod redaktsiei prof. V. Ditiakina
(Moscow: Ateist, 1929); cf. the preface written by the editor Ditiakin, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was
basically a compilation of quotations from the Koran. Klimovich
explained the book's structure, the Koranic image of God, as well
as its narratives on the creation of the world, Judgment Day, Paradise,
and Hell. Above all, he emphasized internal contradictions in the
Koranic message and the scientific inaccurateness and simplicity
of the scripture.

Klimovich's Koran book still followed Mikhail Reisner's view that
Islam emerged from Meccan merchant capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 3 (Ditiakin), 51 (Klimovich). In his preface to Klimovich’s
book, Ditiakin remarked that this view was at least disputed. Ditiakin also openly
criticized Klimovich for certain shortcomings, and maintained that Klimovich’s book was
only a “first attempt” (5).&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran,
according to Klimovich, was an “Arabic law book” which demanded
discipline in the interest of the merchant corporation, whose codex
it represents. Besides trade, a second “way” demanded in the holy
book of Islam is endurance and obedience to God, the Prophet and
his family, as well as to the “people in power”, which, in Klimovich's
mind, clearly reflected the reactionary turn of Islam. The third “way”
of Islam is jihād, the call to fight and kill the unbelievers. As martyrs
would directly go to heaven, Klimovich regarded jihād as “a lottery
in which one cannot lose”.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 57, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence of Muhammad===
In November 1930 Klimovich came up with what he probably believed to be a fatal blow to Islam and at the same time a revolution within Islamic studies. That month he gave a lecture in the Communist Academy (probably in Kazan), asking the provocative question, “Did Muhammad Exist?”&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed? Diskussiia v Kommunisticheskoi akademii v antireligioznoi sektsii instituta filosofii 12/XI 1930g. po dokladu L.I. Klimovicha”,
in: Voinstvuiushchii ateizm, No. 2-3, (1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt; This lecture amounted to a wholesale refutation of Islamic historiography on the early Muslim community. According to Klimovich, no contemporary sources on Muhammad's life have come down to us; the earliest known reports and biographies of the prophet, like that of Ibn Isḥāq/Ibn Hishām, were written by Muslim authors of the mid-8th and 9th centuries. By that time, however, the Muslim scholars themselves had no reliable information on Muhammad's life at their disposal; all they had was the Koran, and therefore their biographies and the ḥadīth material is nothing but a late illustration and commentary on the Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 197. Klimovich does not refer to Western authors who questioned the authenticity of ḥadīth.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by that time the language of the Koran itself was so incomprehensible even to Arabs that the new additional
sources were necessary to make sense of it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200 (with reference to a statement by
Vasilii Bartol’d).&lt;/ref&gt; In result, the time gap between Muhammad's alleged lifetime and the first written
sources was so huge that we cannot suppose that any of the information given in these sources is authentic. According to Klimovich,
also references to Muhammad in Christian sources were anything
but convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich concluded that nothing is known for
sure about the historical Muhammad, and that it is even likely that
he never existed. Quite consequently, Klimovich assumed that the
Koran was not Muhammad's work but the product of a whole
group of authors.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was created by later historians as
a myth, designed to explain the emergence of the Islamic community
out of the Hanif movement. The prophet was an invention to cover
up early Islam's character as a social protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Stalinist Era===
During the Stalinist Era and the domination of Feudalism theory, Klimovich understood he had to withdraw from his view that Islam had initially been a progressive social protest movement. The starting point could no longer be the Koran, the Arabic tradition, or the critique of “bourgeois” Orientalism; instead, one had to start with the works of Marx and Engels. In a lecture held at the KUTV in May 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Published later in Revoliutsionnyi Vostok as “Marx and Engels on Islam and the Problem of Its Origin in Soviet Islamic Studies”&lt;/ref&gt; 120 Klimovich basically listed up all quotes by Engels on Islam which Ditiakin had already published in 1927, without, however, giving any credit to Ditiakin. As we have seen, Engels remarked that religion was a “fantastic” reflection on life, that Islam was the “reaction of the Bedouins” as well as the “first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness”, a “return to the old”. Taking these quotes together, Klimovich concluded that Islam had to be classified as reactionary.

Klimovich now contended that Islam resulted from a process of “feudalization” and centralization of the Arabic tribes, which was reflected in the centralization of the religious cults in the Kaaba. Put in these terms, Islam emerged as the “ideology of feudal lords (Russ. feodalov)”, representing exploitation and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 62f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudalism theory==
This theory remained dominant throughout the Stalinist era and afterward because it confirmed the official Soviet doctrine. The other theories were rejected as "Revisionist" and "Trotskyist"
Already in previous years Soviet anti-religious activists in the Muslim peripheries attacked Muslim landowners alongside mullahs, claiming that Islam supported feudal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;To give an example, anti-religious propaganda in Azerbeijan denounced Islam as “the
ideology of militant trade capitalism” and “a pillar of feudalism” as early as 1928 (''Ba berowski,
Der Feind ist überall'', 559).&lt;/ref&gt; In
the early 1930s, however, Islam itself started to be regarded as a feudal product. At the same time, the tone of the debates became
even more aggressive. One of the earliest contributions to this develop
ment was a review essay written by one Kh. Naumov in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Kh. Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia (K voprosu o
proiskhozhdenii islama)”, in: Revoliutsionnyi Vostok, No. 3-4 (15-16), 1932, 325-339.&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in ''Revoliutsionnyi Vostok''.

Naumov's review essay attacked
Evgenii Beliaev, who had recently published a textbook with Russian
translations of Western European Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev (ed.), Proiskhozhdenie islama: Khrestomatiia, part I (Moscow; Leningrad,
1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov attacked Beliaev harshly not only for “popularizing” the
achievements of bourgeois Orientalists but also for presenting the
three economic environments distinctly, and for adding them up
“mechanically”. Instead of being separated, he insisted, “the three
systems were distinct parts of a unified economy of Arabia in those
days, with the trade regions having a dominant role on the basis
of their feudal relations”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 327f.&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov
nowhere explained this relationship between trade and feudalism,
nor did he provide any sources.

Naumov quoted Engels to the effect that “all religion (…) is
nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s minds of those external
forces which control their daily live”.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, Herr Eugen Dühring’s Revolution in Science (Anti-Dühring), (New
York: International Publishers, 1939), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This quote alone sufficed
him to maintain that “the Koran is the distorted fantastic expression
of the reality of those times”. Consequently, it is wrong to regard
the Koran as a source for early Islam. Naumov went on to explain
that it is also inacceptable to make a distinction between Muslims
and non-Muslims, as Beliaev had done when he mentioned that the
Muslims of Medina were attacking the caravans of pagan Mecca.
Making a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, so Naumov,
means to take over the position of “missionaries” who sort out the
non-believers (as we will see, the accusation that Orientalists become
missionaries, that scholarship serves religion, was becoming a convenient
and widespread instrument of defamation in the 1930s).
Naumov also attacked many other Marxist Orientalists, including
Liutsian Klimovich for his view that Islam was a “social revolution”
of the “progressive elements of Arabic trade capital”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naumov's leveling of Muslims and non-Muslims, his disregard for
religion as a special factor, can probably best be characterized as an
ultra-leftist position. In general, however, his rejection of the importance
of religion and personalities and his deterministic emphasis
on materialism can still be linked to the school of M.N. Pokrovskii.

“The centralization of the
monetary capital in some Arabian cities, above all in Mecca, the
struggle against the ‘colonizers’ [i.e., the Ethiopians and the Persians],
the dissolution of natural (economic) relations, and the process of
class warfare in general pushed the Arabs with iron inevitability
towards the creation of an Arabic state.”&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich embraced the Feudalism theory wholeheartedly and attacked Navshirvanov&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 64 (Grimme), 66 (Bartol’d, Navshirvanovs),
69 (Müller). Also attacked is P.K. Zhuze, “Iz istorii kommunisticheskogo dvizheniia v
islame”, in: Nauchnoe obozrenie no. 1 (1923), 26-34 (not available to me).&lt;/ref&gt; and Tomara &lt;ref&gt;Klimovich refers specifically to Tomara’s article “Islam i kommunizm”, published by
Ditiakin in his volume of articles entitled Islam (Moscow, 1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich attacked the “trade capitalism theory” of Reisner with
similar harshness; to be sure, Reisner had died some years before,
but as seen above, his theory had been taken up and modified by
Evgenii Beliaev and others.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 77. Klimovich also attacked Nikolai Smirnov’s
(1886-1983) Musul’manskoe sektantstvo (Moscow, 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in the general political atmosphere of the country and
in Islamic studies in particular prompted many authors to readjust
their positions. This produced a weak but unified Soviet theory on
Islam that would henceforth be regarded as dogma. In the following years it became impossible to describe Islam in
any meaningful manner. The surviving participants in the Soviet
discourse on Islam had to subscribe to the dogma that linked Islam
to feudalism. At the same time it was carefully avoided to ascribe
any content to the term “feudal”, or to explain its relationship with
the “trade capitalists”.&lt;ref&gt;Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)==

===Article 4 paragraph 1,CEDAW===
The CEDAW or the Convention,   also known as the international Bill of Women's Rights,  is a legally binding  [[international treaty]]  ratified by 187 States Parties, that entered into force in 1981.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women :Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 34/180 of 18 December 1979.

The  UN Doctrine of  Gender Equality, and 'Special Measures for Gender Equality' are  inspired by  and rooted in the  CEDAW, specifically in  Article 4 paragraph 1, which states:

''Article 4, paragraph 1 : Adoption by States Parties of '''temporary special measures''' aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved. [emphasis added].''&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

===General Recommendation No. 25, on Article 4, paragraph 1  of CEDAW ===
The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), an expert body composed of 23 experts on women's issues established in 1982 to monitor the progress of the CEDAW's implementation,  in 2004,  adopted    ''General Recommendation 25, on Temporary Special Measures, on Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=UN|title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women Thirtieth session (12–30 January 2004) Thirty-first session (6-23 July 2004)|date=2004|volume=General Assembly Official Records Fifty-ninth Session Supplement No. 38 (A/59/38)|issue=A/59/38|pages=Annexure1 78–86|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/462/77/PDF/N0446277.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=UN|location=New York|issn=0255-0970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recommendation 'clarifies the nature and meaning of article 4, paragraph 1, in order to  facilitate and ensure the implementation of Temporary special measures   and  accelerate  progress in achieving gender equality in 'employment and professional fields'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"/&gt;

The purpose of the "special measures", which are 'temporary' is " to accelerate the improvement of the position of women to achieve their  "substantive equality with men, and to effect the structural, social and cultural changes necessary to correct past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women, as well as to provide them with compensation."   These      are   not   an exception 'to the norm of non-discrimination', but rather 'part of a necessary strategy'   to  achieve 'substantive equality of women'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 18}} The  'temporary special measures',   includes ''''preferential treatment; targeted recruitment, hiring and promotion; numerical goals connected with time frames; and quota systems''''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 22}}

=== UN and Article 4, paragraph 1 on Special Measures ===
The UN  Committee on CEDAW in its general recommendations number 25  commended the  Secretary General on his  initiative to   implement 'temporary special measures', noting  ''"The use of temporary special measures by the Secretary-General of the United  Nations is a practical example in the area of women's employment, including through  administrative instructions on  the recruitment, promotion and placement of women in the  Secretariat. These measures aim at achieving the goal of 50/50 gender distribution at all  levels, but at the higher  echelons in particular"''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|note 3}}

In 2012, the UN  Secretary General drawing attention to   Article 4  paragraph 1 of the  ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]''  assured the  [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]  that Special Measures were temporary,  and   will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time".&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;

Gender equality in the United Nations (UN),  particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above level, has been a United Nations General Assembly goal since 1970 and a recurring concern since then.&lt;ref name="women, 15 December 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 1930 Plenary Meeting|first1=United Nations|title=Employment of Qualified Women in Senior and other professional positions by the secretariats of Organisations in the United Nations system|journal=General assembly Resolution|date=15 December 1970|volume=2715 (XXV)|page=31|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/349/80/IMG/NR034980.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 72nd plenary meeting|title=Personnel questions : C Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=21 December 1990|volume=A/RES/45/239|issue=|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r239.htm|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the [[Un secretariat|UN Secretariat]],  in order to better focus efforts to wards achieving Gender Equality, prepared its first five-year "Action plan to improve the status of women for the period 1985-90".&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="40/258. 18 December 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=United Nations|title=Improvement of Status of women in the Secretariat|date=18 December 1985|volume=40/258 B|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1985/349.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then there have been several Five Year Plans, including Strategic Plans, to Improve the Status of Women in the UN.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;  In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly after years of slow progress, urged the Secretary General to "accord priority" to increase "the participation of women at the D-1 level and above to 25 per cent " by 1995.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;

===Reasons for continuing  Gender Equality===
Reasons  most frequently cited for failure to meet the General Assembly targets   for  Gender Equality,   and slide in   women's representation  at the D1 and above level,   according to the Secretary General, are:  [a]  failure by some "entities"   in the "implementation of special measures for gender equality",  and [b]  tardy implementation of five year Actions Plans [para 143].&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A /65/334"/&gt;{{rp|Table 19, p 29}} In  2010-2011 only two out of thirty departments  in the UN  applied the "target of gender parity"[A/67/347,  p 46, paragraph 110(b)]. The  [[UN Secretariat]], the largest entity in the United Nations system, in which 38.7 percent of the staff is women, according to the report, claimed to be one of them. .&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|paragraph p 46, Para B 3(b }}

==Special measures for the achievement of gender equality==
The Special Measures in ST/AI/1999/9, which has four sections, apply throughout the Secretariat "for the filling of all vacant posts in the Professional category and above", including temporary posts.&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;{{rp|Section 1 and 2}}  Sections 1.6 and 1.8   of the ST/AI makes clear  that special measures "shall apply to the selection of staff for posts in all categories where '''women are under-represented'''".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|Section 1.9}}

===Goal===
The Goal of the ''Special Measures'' as set by the General Assembly  is to  achieve a 50/50 gender  distribution in  the entire organization  and all departments, and  in all "posts in the professional category and above,  including posts at the D1 level and above.  This goal applies throughout the Organization, and in every department, office or regional commission, overall and at each level. It applies not only to posts subject to geographical distribution but to all categories of posts, irrespective of the type or duration of the appointment ..., the series of the Staff Rules under which the appointment is to be given ... or the source of funding. ..."&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|section1.1}}&lt;ref name="Gender related  system policies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote= ST/AI/1999/9 will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulative seniority===
Section 1.6 of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates that "Cumulative seniority shall be taken into account when considering women candidates for promotion, except when it would adversely affect their situation. Cumulative seniority shall be calculated as the average of the years of the staff member accrued in her present Professional grade and in her immediately preceding Professional grade".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

===Selection appointment ===
Section 1.8  of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates "Vacancies in the Professional category and above '''shall''' be filled, when there are one or more women candidates, by one of those candidates" when "Her qualifications meet the requirements for the vacant post";  and "her qualifications are '''substantially equal''' (emphasis added) or superior to those of competing male candidates" (Section 1.8 (i)(ii)).&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

==Implementation and Monitoring==

The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN-Women,  the United Nations entity responsible  for 'gender equality',  and  holding  "the UN system accountable for its own commitments on gender equality"  has  also promulgated that  the Gender Parity A/I  will "remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made".&lt;ref name="Gender related system policies2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote=II.  will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made. The special measures governing the selection and placement of women candidates apply for the filing of all vacant posts at the Professional level in every department and office that has not met the goal of 50/50 gender distribution overall and at each grade level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretary General Report on  Special Measures==
Special Measures have found regular affirmation by the Secretary General  in his reports to the General Assembly. In 2011, Secretary-General's Policy Committee, of which all heads of departments (HOD) are members, including HOD of management,   decided    on "specific actions"   to "accelerate progress towards the goal  of gender parity".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;  An important  measure identified for action was  measures  for more effective implementations of  Special Measures. The Secretary General in  the  "Report of the  Secretary General" to the General Assembly, in September 2012, to accelerate the goal of gender parity, affirmed the following:&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;
* Special measures, include "targeted recruitment and promotion"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp| p33, para 68}}
* Temporary special measures, paraphrasing section 1.8 of ST/AI 1999/9, "should be effectively utilized for the placement of women candidates who are '''equally or substantially better qualified''' and should be introduced or restored in entities and at levels where progress is slow".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, para 143(b}}   
* Special measures "include mandatory selection of equally or better qualified women candidates, mandatory inclusion of women candidates on all shortlists, and justification in cases where they have not been included or where the shortlisted women are not selected despite prevailing imbalance at that level"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}}
* Special measures, in ST/AI 1999/9 to be revised and strengthened, to ensure effective implementation&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 45, para 108}} 
* Senior officials to ensure "effective implementation of special measures for gender equality."&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}} 
* Special Measures are temporary and will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time";&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|para 67}}
* In the context of the legal challenges to Special Measures in the United Nations, and hesitant implementation by some UN entities, the Secretary General  drew attention to the judgment by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, in November 1994,  and   reiterated that "special measures are fully compatible with the objectives of Article 8 of the Charter of the United Nations".&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 34 paragraph 72}}

==New staff selection system  and Gender Equality A/I==
{{Main|United Nations Staff Selection System}}
The [[United Nations Secretariat]], in  April  2010,   superseded   the  old  Staff selection  system (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1) with a new  [[United Nations Staff Selection System|staff selection system (ST/AI 2010/3)]].&lt;ref name="2010/3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN Secretariat|title=Administrative instruction  Staff selection system, ST /AI/2010/3|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/324/85/PDF/N1032485.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=UN Secretariat|accessdate=6 April 2015|page=1|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p2, preamble}}&lt;ref name="2010/3"/&gt;{{rp|p17, section 13.2}}  The new Staff selection system  was  listed in 2014 with   Gender Affirmative A/I ((ST/AI 1999/9))  as applicable  law for '''Appointments, placement and promotion'''.&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2ST /AI/1999/9-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=ST /AI/1999/9.

== Special Measures and jurisprudence==
UNAT jurisprudence has, in its consideration of unsuccessful male candidates,  as well as claims of women under the Organization's affirmative action policies,   repeatedly upheld  affirmative action provisions in  ST/AI/412  and its  successor ST/AI 1999/9,   as lawful and in accordance with the  UN Charter. ST/AI 1999/9.   ST/AI 1999/9 continues to be cited as an applicable  instrument  by  applicants,  as well as the respondent,  in  cases before the  [[United Nations Dispute Tribunal|UN Dispute Tribunal(UNDT)]]   and the [[United Nations Appeals Tribunal (UNAT)]].

===Judgement No. 671, Grinblat(1994)===
United Nations Administrative tribunal  with Judge Sumar Sen as president,  in a seminal  Judgment on affirmative action,  held   : "that the various resolutions for Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter.&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations, article 8"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charter of the United Nations|title=Article 8 Charter of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter3.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=CHAPTER III: ORGANS|date=26 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the [[Charter of the United Nations|Charter]] must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this  unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly.

United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Mayer Gabay, President; Ms. Marsha A.Echols; and Mr. Omer Yousif Bireedo)  in the case of an unsuccessful male candidate who challenged the promotion of a woman as unlawful and in violation of his rights of due process,  citing UNAT Judgements No. 411 (1988) and No. 958 (2000), recalled its “established jurisprudence ... that appointments and promotions are within the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General”,&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p6, paragraph IV}} and  that "qualifications, experience, favourable performance reports and seniority are appraised freely by the Secretary-General and therefore cannot be considered by staff members as giving rise to any expectancy".  The tribunal held that these "discretionary powers of the Secretary-General are not absolute.  They are governed by the relevant provisions of the Charter and by General Assembly resolutions.  In this context the Tribunal notes that ST/AI/412 provides that special measures for the achievement of gender equality within the Secretariat must be instituted towards achieving the goal of '50-50 parity between men and women both overall and for positions at the D-1 level and above by the year 2000.  It also provides for flexibility in various promotion requirements in order to increase the number of women considered for promotions, for example flexibility regarding seniority."&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph V}}

The Tribunal concluded that the male candidate had received "full and fair consideration" for the post and that the Organization was not bound by the recommendation of the hiring department.&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph VII}} ''The Tribunal held that the Secretary-General "acted within his discretionary authority in deciding to promote a substantially equally qualified female candidate to the D-1 level post"&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph V}}''

===Judgement No. 1302, (2006)===
United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Spyridon Flogaitis, President; Mr. Kevin Haugh; Ms. Brigitte Stern) held  that ST/AI/1999/9 required that where there are both male and female candidates with substantially equal qualifications, "the female candidate should be appointed unless the qualifications of the male candidate are in some demonstrable and measurable way superior to those of the best qualified female candidate. The Tribunal has chosen to use the words 'demonstrable' and 'measurable' advisedly for, since appointment and promotion decisions are amenable to administrative review under the Organization's internal justice system and under the Statute of the Tribunal, and since the body carrying out such review ... should act on identifiable facts and on evidence, there should be evidence which can be examined and assessed by the body carrying out the review from which it can be determined if the affirmative action requirements have been fully complied with. This is an essential requirement if there is to be a meaningful review and if the policy of ST/AI/1999/9 or other affirmative action policy is to be enforced as an imperative. Otherwise, such policies become mere shibboleths or mere set pieces of lip service invoked in the pretence of achieving their objectives."&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}} The tribunal concluded that although as a general principle, the party making an allegation bears the burden of proving it,  but "this general proposition must require modification where the relevant evidence is solely in the hands of the Administration  and not available to an Applicant, the onus of proof in certain matters should be viewed as neutral rather than as resting on the Applicant".  The Tribunal, while  agreeing with the conclusions of the Joint Appeals Board (JAB) that "since there was no demonstrable or measurable evidence to support a conclusion that the successful male candidate enjoyed substantially superior qualifications when compared with those of the Applicant, a breach of ST/AI/1999/9 [had] been established"  Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay the Applicant the difference between her salary at the P-3 level and the P-4 salary that she would have received had she been appointed to the post in question, from October 2002, for the lesser of either two years or until her promotion to the P-4 level, and ordered the Respondent either to place the Applicant on the "Galaxy roster" until she secures a suitable post at the P-4 level or to pay her two months' net base salary .&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}}

===Appleton (2012)===
In  August 2012, the  Organization    acknowledged ST/AI/1999/9 (Special measures for achieving Gender Equality) as  applicable law  on gender balance, noting that "The general provisions to give women preferential treatment for appointments are found in ST/AI/1999/9" and that   "selection, vacancies shall be filled by a woman if her qualifications: (a) meet the requirements for the vacant post and (b) are substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates (sec. 1.8)"&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Case No. UNDT/NY/2010/085  Judgment No.: UNDT/2012/125  Date: 14 August 2012  UNITED  NATIONS  DISPUTE  TRIBUNAL:APPLETON v.

===Tribunal judgments and orders related to ST/AI/1999/9 (Gender AI)===
Gender A/I, as  already mentioned,  has often been a subject of litigation.  In cases brought before the tribunal,  the respondent, ie, the Secretary General,   has, so far, not contested the applicability of the  gender AI as applicable law.  The  tribunal  in  several cases has upheld the validity of Gender AI and  cited it in its judgment.   A tabulation of the salient cases  in which  Gender A/I  has been a subject of litigation, and judgments by the tribunal, is below:

'''Tatoeba.org''' is a free [[collaboration|collaborative]] online [[database]] of example sentences geared towards [[Second-language acquisition|foreign language learners]].  Its name comes from the Japanese term "tatoeba" (例えば　''tatoeba''), meaning "for example".  Unlike other [[Dictionary#Online dictionaries|online dictionaries]], which focus on words, '''Tatoeba''' focuses on translation of [[complete sentence]]s.  In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize [[one-to-many (data model)|one-to-many relationships]]. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another.

==The aim of the project==
The aim of the Tatoeba Project is to create a database of sentences and translations that can be used by anyone developing a language learning [[application software|application]]. The idea is that the project creates the data, so [[programmer]]s can just focus on [[Computer programming|coding]] the application.

The data collected by the project is freely available under a [[Creative_Commons_license#Types_of_licenses|Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)]] license.

==Content==
As of November 2017, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 6,000,000 sentences in 319 languages. The top 21 languages make up 90% of the corpus. Eighty-five of these languages have over 1,000 sentences. The top 13 languages have over 100,000 sentences each. The [[User interface|interface]] is available in 25 different languages. 

Tatoeba.org is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus |title=Tanaka Corpus |date=3 February 2011 |work=EDRDG Wiki |publisher=Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdicinf.html#examp_tags |title=WWWJDIC – Information |date=2 March 2011 |last=Breen |first=Jim |work=WWWJDIC |publisher=Monash University |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual statistic of all languages are found at [https://tatoeba.org/epo/stats/sentences_by_language]

==History==

Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name "multilangdict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/multilangdict/|title=Trang's dictionary project|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
Users, even those who are not registered, can search for words in any language to retrieve sentences that use them.  Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated.  Sentences are [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] for content such as subject matter, [[dialect]], or [[vulgarity]]; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of early 2016, more than 200,000 sentences in 19 languages had audio readings. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio.

Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. However, it is preferred that users translate into their native or "strongest" language and add sentences from their native language rather than translating into or adding from their target language.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/quick-start&lt;/ref&gt;  Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically.  Users can freely edit their own sentences, "adopt" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences.  Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change.

==Database structure==
[[File:Grafeo.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A simplified [[diagram]] of Tatoeba's underlying data structure.]]
Tatoeba's basic [[data structure]] is a series of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] and links.  Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2010/02/how-to-be-good-contributor-in-tatoeba.html |title=How to be a good contributor in Tatoeba |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
The entire Tatoeba database is published under a [[Creative Commons licenses#Original licenses|Creative Commons Attribution 2.0]] license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tatoeba.org/eng/terms-of-use |title=Terms of use |work=Tatoeba.org |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing it for academic and other use.

==Grants==

Tatoeba received a grant from [[HASTAC#Events|Mozilla Drumbeat]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2011/01/grant-from-mozilla-drumbeat.html |title=Grant from Mozilla Drumbeat |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |title=Best Drumbeat Projects: Tatoeba – a free and open database of sentences |work=Yoyodyne.cc |last=Moltke |first=Henrik |date=30 December 2010 |quote=...the Mozilla Foundation wants to encourage and help the Tatoeba project by giving it a USD 2.5K Mozilla Drumbeat Grant. |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102095352/http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some work on the Tatoeba infrastructure was sponsored by [[Google Summer of Code]], 2014 edition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/tatoeba&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Parallel text corpora such as Tatoeba are used for a variety of [[natural language processing]] tasks such as [[machine translation]].  The Tatoeba data has been used as data for [[treebank]]ing Japanese&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bond, 栗林 孝行 [Takayuki Kuribayashi], 橋本 力 [Hashimoto Chikara] (2008)

"'''The Engineering of Consent'''" is an [[essay]] by [[Edward Bernays]] first published in 1947, and a [[#Book|book]] he published in 1955.

==Overview==

In his own words, Bernays describes engineering consent as "use  of  an  engineering  approach—that is, action  based  only  on   thorough  knowledge of  the  situation  and  on  the  application  of  scientific  principles  and  tried practices  to  the  task  of  getting  people to   support   ideas   and  programs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernays|first1=Edward|title=The engineering of consent.|date=1969|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=9780806103280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernays explained, "Professionally, [public relations] activities are planned and executed by trained practitioners in accordance with scientific principles, based on the findings of [[social scientist]]s. Their dispassionate approach and methods may be likened to those of the engineering professions which stem from the [[physical science]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bernays 1955 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of engineered consent in democracy has been expressed in a textbook on American government:&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 11, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Under modern conditions of political advertising and manipulation, it has become possible to talk of the engineering of consent by an elite of experts and professional politicians. Consent that is thus engineered is difficult to distinguish in any fundamental way from the consent that supports modern totalitarian governments. Were the manipulated voter to become the normal voter, the government he supports could hardly be said to rest on his consent in any traditional sense of that word.

To some observers, [[Consumer psychology|consumer psychologists]] have already made the choice for people before they buy a certain product. [[Marketing]] is often based on themes and symbols that unconsciously influence consumer behavior.

| dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's observations in the essay include the following:
* The United States has become a small room where a single whisper is magnified thousands of times.
* There are two divisions in media: commercial and organized group information systems.
* Today’s leaders have become more remote physically from the public, yet, at the same time, the public has much greater familiarity with these leaders through the system of modern communications...Increased influence of mass media is due to widespread and enormously rapid diffusion of [[literacy]].
* With the aid of technicians in the field who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communications, [some leaders] have been able to achieve purposefully and scientifically what we have termed "the engineering of consent".
* The freedoms of press, speech, petition and assembly, the freedoms which make the engineering of consent possible, are among the most cherished guarantees in the Constitution of the United States.
* Under no circumstances should the engineering of consent supersede or displace the educational system, either formal or informal, in bringing about understanding by the people as the basis for their actions. The engineering of consent often does supplement the educational process.
* The chief function [of the profession] is to analyze objectively and realistically the position of its client vis-a-vis a public, and to advise as to the necessary corrections in its client’s attitudes towards and approaches to that public.
* It must be remembered of course that good will, the basis of lasting adjustment, can be preserved in the long run, only by those whose actions warrant it...The public relations counsel has the professional responsibility to push only those ideas that he can respect, and not to promote causes or accept assignments for clients he considers anti-social.
* As in physical engineering, a feasibility study must be done and a budget drawn up.
* The engineer of consent must be powerfully equipped with facts, with truths, with evidence before he shows himself before a public.
* Bernays recommends ''[[World Almanac]]'' with lists of thousands of [[voluntary association|associations]] across the United States – a cross-section of the country.
* The public’s attitudes, ideas, presumptions or prejudices result from definite influences. One must try to find out what they are in any situation in which one is working.
* Democratic society is actually only a loose aggregate of constituent groups...To influence the public, the engineer of consent works with and through group leaders and opinion moulders on every level.
* [[Research]] furnishes the equivalent of the mariner's chart, the architect's blue print,the traveler's road map.
* Themes must appeal to the motives of the public. [[Motivation|Motives]] are the activation of both conscious and subconscious pressure created by the force of desires
* Organization also correlates the activities of any specialists who may be called upon from time to time, such as opinion researchers, fund raisers, publicity men, radio and motion picture experts, specialists for women's clubs or foreign language groups, and the like.
* Set in motion a broad activity, the success of which depends on interlocking all phases and elements of the proposed strategy, implemented by tactics that are timed to the moment of maximum effectiveness.
* The developing of events and circumstances that are not routine is one of the basic functions of the engineer of consent.

==Book==
In 1955 [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published Bernays' book ''The Engineering of Consent''.  In fact Bernays contributed only the first chapter (22 pages) "The Theory and Practice of Public Relations: A Resumé". The seven other chapters were by his associates: "Objectives" by Howard Walden Cutler, "Research" by Sherwood Dodge, "Strategy" by [[Nicholas Samstag]], "Themes and Symbols" by [[Doris Fleischman]] and H.W. Cutler, "Organization for public relations" by John Price Jones, "Planning" by [[Benjamin Fine]], and "The tactics of public relations" by A. Robert Ginsburgh.

The longest chapter, the one on strategy, begins with sociological and psychological observations on human motivation drawn from [[Karl Menninger]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Samstag illustrates varieties of strategy with sample cases before the public. He details aspects of timing, forbearance, approach, surprise, participation, association, disassociation, crossroads, personalization, bland withdrawal, apparent withdrawal, apparent runner-up, omission, reversal, mosaic, and understatement.

===Reviews===
A. Edgar Schuler&lt;ref&gt;A. Edgar Schuler (1956) [http://chla.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=chla;cc=chla;rgn=full%20text;idno=5075626_4307_001;didno=5075626_4307_001;view=image;seq=0084;node=5075626_4307_001%3A5.13 Review: The Engineering of Consent], Rural Sociology 21(1):80, link from [[Cornell University]] Core Historical Literature of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; called the book a "convenient and compact introduction to the field of public relations." He singles out Samstag’s chapter as "interesting, enlightening, provocative, and poignant."

M. Weisglas reviewed the book for [[International Communication Gazette]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Weisglas (1956) "Review: Engineering of Consent", [[International Communication Gazette]] 2:59&lt;/ref&gt; panning it saying "Bernay’s and company have deluded their readers with false hopes about public relations- truths."

==Women’s smoking==
{{See also|Tobacco advertising}}
In a practical example of Edward Bernays’ theory detailed in his essay, [[George Washington Hill]], president of the [[American Tobacco Company]], hired Edward Bernays in 1928 to lead a campaign to entice more women to smoke in public.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is believed to have helped converting attitudes towards women's smoking from a social [[taboo]] to a more socially acceptable act.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom" /&gt; Bernays did this by associating women’s smoking with the ideas of "power" and "freedom" which he did by using the slogan [[Torches of Freedom]] during a famous parade in [[New York City]].

The idea of “Engineering of Consent” was motivated by [[Freud]]’s idea that humans are irrational beings, and are motivated primarily by inner desires hidden in their [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. If one understood what those unconscious desires were, then one could use this to one’s advantage to sell products and increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn T. Tanoue (2000) "Cigarette Smoking and Women's Respiratory Health", ''Clinics in Chest Medicine'' 21(1): 47–65 {{doi| 10.1016/S0272-5231(05)70007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Engineering of Consent also applies to the pioneered application of Freudian psychoanalytic concepts and techniques to business—in particular to the study of consumer behavior in the marketplace. Ideas established strongly influenced the practices of the advertising industry in the twentieth century.

The techniques applied developing the "consumer lifestyle" were also later applied to developing theories in [[cultural commodification]]; which has proven successful in the later 20th century (with diffusion of cultures throughout North America) to sell ethnic foods and style in popular mainstream culture by removing them from geography and ethnic histories and sanitizing them for a general public.

[[Ernest Dichter]] applied what he dubbed "the strategy of desire" for building a "stable society," by creating for the public a common identity through the products they consumed; again, much like with cultural commodification, where culture has no "identity," "meaning," or "history" inherited from previous generations, but rather, is created by the attitudes which are introduced by consumer behaviors and social patterns of the period. According to Dichter, "To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-sought gratification. Modern man is internally ready to fulfill his self-image, by purchasing products which compliment it."
