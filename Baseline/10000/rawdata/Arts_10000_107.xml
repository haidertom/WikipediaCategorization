'''''The Adoration of the Magi'''''  is an [[oil painting]] on wood panel by [[Netherlandish art|Netherlandish]] artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], executed around 1475. It is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum, New York]], US. A prominent feature of this painting is the strong perspective effect&lt;ref&gt;M. Ilsink and J. Koldeweij, Hieronymus Bosch, Visions of Genius, Yale University Press 2016, pp.58-61&lt;/ref&gt; and also the copious use of [[gold leaf]] which is not very typical for Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Matthijs Ilsink, Robert G. Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 172 – 181&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pigments]] employed are red lake, [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow]] and [[ochres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-adoration-magi-new-york/ Hieronymus Bosch, The Adoration of the Magi (New York)], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise authorship of this panel is and has been disputed, but in 2016 the Bosch Research and Conservation Project attributed it to Bosch based on evidence in the underdrawing.

A '''Brunaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of brown.  Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en brunaille''".&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 2437, Old Master Pictures'', lot 51, Amsterdam, Christie’s, 8 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Brunaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries,  which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. However, it was only in the early 17th century that the French term “''brunaille''” was coined to describe pictures painted in shades of brown.&lt;ref&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Brunaille are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]''), though more common than those in green ([[verdaille]]).

[[Image:Bulford Kiwi 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Kiwi before it was cleaned in 2007]]

The '''Bulford Kiwi'''{{coord|51|11|38.84|N|1|42|54.20|W|type:landmark|display=title}} is a large depiction of a [[kiwi]], carved in the [[chalk]] on Beacon Hill above the military town of [[Bulford]] on [[Salisbury Plain]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. It was created in 1919 by soldiers of the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] who were awaiting repatriation following the end of [[First World War]].

It is one of the few [[hill figure]]s in Wiltshire to be neither a white horse nor a military badge.

==History==
[[Sling Camp]] (now gone), part of [[Bulford Camp]], was established in June 1916 for the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (NZEF). Soldiers of the NZEF underwent training here when arriving in England before being transferred to New Zealand units serving on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]. The Kiwi was constructed on Beacon Hill overlooking the camp.

After the war was over, the New Zealand soldiers were eager to return home, but no troop ships were available. In the wake of riots by disaffected soldiers, their commanding officers decided that the troops should be kept busy carving an enormous [[kiwi]] into the chalk of the hill. This was done in February and March 1919, by the Canterbury&lt;ref name="NHLE" /&gt; and Otago&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/WILTSHIRE-EMI/2001-01/0979549654 RootsWeb: WILTSHIRE-EMI-L 3 RSA review The KIWI Bulford/Sling Camp&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers|Engineers Battalions]]. The emblem is cut out of the chalk hillside, and stands out in contrast from the surrounding vegetation.

The design was executed by Sergeant-Major Percy Cecil Blenkarne, a drawing instructor in the Education Staff, from a sketch of a stuffed kiwi specimen in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="NHLE" /&gt; The site was surveyed and the design extended on to the site by Sergeant-Major V.T. Low, NZE of the Education Staff.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

* The [[beak]] is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long.
* The letters "N.Z." are {{convert|65|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Bergamar|title=Discovering Hill Figures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-XWAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Shire|isbn=978-0-7478-0345-4|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
In the years after the Kiwi's creation, the [[Kiwi (shoe polish)|Kiwi Polish Company]] maintained the Kiwi through their offices in London, employing local villagers to do the work. Although it had "little if any advertising value [for the company]", they explained their interest in its upkeep as its being a memorial to the New Zealand troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/museum-news/acquisitions.html Recent Acquisitions: Army Museum Waiouru, New Zealand : Military History &amp; Army War Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608234033/http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/museum-news/acquisitions.html |date=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the Kiwi was camouflaged with [[leaf mold|leaf mould]], out of concerns that [[Luftwaffe|German bombers]] would use it as a navigation marker during their [[The Blitz|raids over Britain]]. In 1948, the leaf mould was removed by local [[Scout Section (UK)|Boy Scouts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiltshirescouts.org.uk/1stBulford/Kiwi%20History.htm The History of the Kiwi] – 1st Bulford Scouts: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012142/http://www.wiltshirescouts.org.uk/1stBulford/Kiwi%20History.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fresh chalk was added. The Scout troop subsequently renamed themselves in the kiwi's honour.

In the early 1950s, Blenkarne negotiated for the kiwi to be maintained by the British Army’s 3 (UK) Divisional Headquarters and Signal Regiment following on from the work done by 249 Signal Squadron. 3 DHQ&amp;SR was part of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]].

As of 2007, the Kiwi is maintained by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EstateAndEnvironment/BulfordKiwiGetsAFacelift.htm Ministry of Defence | Defence News | Bulford Kiwi gets a facelift&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710221105/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EstateAndEnvironment/BulfordKiwiGetsAFacelift.htm |date=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the chalk figure was designated as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1443438|desc=Kiwi Chalk Figure above Bulford Camp|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2018 the Kiwi was given a resurfacing. 100 tons of chalk were ferried by [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopter]] to the site where under the guidance of Richard Osgood, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation archaeologist, it was spread over the figure to restore it for the first time in 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Viewing and access==
Views of the kiwi are largely obscured, as the straight-ahead view is from within the camp. The kiwi is visible from Tidworth Road which passes the kiwi from the left at a skewed angle, and it is possible to walk up from there to the kiwi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://talltales.me/2012/07/15/the-bulford-chalk-kiwi/ The Bulford Chalk Kiwi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ngatapuwae.govt.nz/sling-camp Sling Camp - Ngā Tapuwae]&lt;/ref&gt; Very distorted views of the kiwi from the right of the hill can be seen from [[Woodhenge]] and from near [[Stonehenge]].

==Nearby==
There have been several military hill figures in Wiltshire, and this is the only surviving example which does not depict a badge. Roughly 20 miles from the Bulford Kiwi are the [[Fovant Badges]], a group of eight military badges cut mostly by camps in World War I. There used to be more badges on the hill, and until 2005, there were two more nearby at [[Sutton Mandeville]] and the outline of Australia also nearby in [[Compton Chamberlayne]]. Another nearby military badge is Lamb Down Military Badge near [[Codford St. Mary]].

'''''Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees''''') [''German: '''Kamel (in rhythmischer baumlandschaft)'''''] is a painting by Swiss artist [[Paul Klee]] in the collection of the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]] in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstsammlung.de/en/discover/collections/focuses/paul-klee.html|title=Paul Klee|date=|website=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|publisher=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is one of the first Klee did in oils and is typical of the artist's interest in colour theory, draughtsmanship and musicality. It is also one of many images in Western art to use camels as subject matter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~h1981d0z/pdf/2015-05-london/soas-london.pdf|title=The representation of the Camel in Western visual arts over 2000 years|last=Schwartz|first=H.J.|date=May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the painting is based on horizontal bands dotted with circular shapes.

== Subject  ==
Camels appear in manuscripts, mosaics, sculptures and paintings. For example, camels and horses appear in illustrations to the travel memoir of [[John Mandeville]] in the fourteenth century. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the nineteenth century include ones by artists such as [[Carl Haag]] ("Danger in the Desert", 1867) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] ("Street Scene, Egypt", 1869).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The memorial on the [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] in London commemorates the [[Imperial Camel Corps Memorial|Imperial Camel Corps]] in sculpture.

The year before, Klee had produced another camel painting in oils entitled "Two Camels and a donkey" (1919).

"Camel in rhythmic landscape with trees" is considered one of a series that includes "Rythmic Tree Landcape".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee: dialogue with nature|author1=Paul Klee |author2=Ernst-Gerhard Güse |author3=Richard Verdi |publisher=Prestel|year=1991|isbn=978-3-79131-141-8|location=Munich|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar landscapes, such as "Small rhythmic landscape" were also created at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/landscapes/klee-small-rhythmic-landscape.htm|title=Small Rhythmic Landscape (c1920)|date=|website=theartwolf.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' I would like now to examine the dimensions of the object in a new light to try to show how it is that the artist frequently arrives at what appears to be such an arbitrary 'deformation' of natural forms.''

''First, he does not attach such intense importance to natural form as do so many realist critics, because, for him, these final forms are not the real stuff of the process of natural creation. For he places more value on the powers which do the forming than on the final forms themselves.''&lt;br&gt; - Paul Klee&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;
}}

This is the period when the artist was working and teaching at the [[Bauhaus]] in Weimar under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]]. The task of teaching caused Klee to meditate on the problems of art and as a result he produced what [[Herbert Read]] called "the most profound and illuminating statement of the aesthetic basis of the modern movement in art ever made by a practising artist".&lt;ref name = Klee&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee on Modern Art|last=Klee|first=Paul|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1958|isbn=|edition= English edition, with introduction by Herbert Read, translated by Paul Findlay.

[[File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|thumb|Book of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Sahih Bukhari]], featuring 3882 chapters.]]

A '''chapter''' is one of the main divisions of a piece of writing of relative length, such as a [[book]] of [[prose]], [[poetry]], or [[law]]. A chapter book may have multiple chapters and these can be referred to by the things that may be the main topic of that specific chapter. In each case, chapters can be numbered or titled or both.  An example of a chapter that has become well known is "Down the [[White Rabbit|Rabbit]]-Hole", which is the first chapter from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

==Chapter structure==

Many [[novel]]s of great length have chapters. [[Non-fiction]] books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into [[Section (writing)|sections]]. Larger works with a lot of chapters often group them in several 'parts' as the main subdivision of the book.

The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a [[table of contents]]. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always. If chapters are used they are normally numbered sequentially; they may also have titles, and in a few cases an epigraph or prefatory quotation. In older novels it was a common practice to summarise the content of each chapter in the table of contents and/or in the beginning of the chapter.

==Unusual numbering schemes==

In works of fiction, authors sometimes number their chapters eccentrically, often as a [[metafictional]] statement.  For example:
*''[[Seiobo There Below]]'' by [[László Krasznahorkai]] has chapters numbered according to the [[Fibonacci sequence]].
*''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]] only has chapters which are [[prime numbers]].
*''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' by [[Flann O'Brien]] has the first page titled ''Chapter 1'', but has no further chapter divisions.
*''God, A Users' Guide'' by [[Seán Moncrieff]] is chaptered backwards (i.e., the first chapter is chapter 20 and the last is chapter 1). The novel ''[[The_Running_Man_(novel)|The Running Man]]'' by [[Stephen King]] also uses a similar chapter numbering scheme.
*Every novel in the series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' by [[Lemony Snicket]] has [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]] chapters, except the final instalment (''[[The End (A Series of Unfortunate Events)|The End]]''), which has a fourteenth chapter formatted as its own novel.
*''[[Mammoth (John Varley)|Mammoth]]'' by [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]] has the chapters ordered chronologically from the point of view of a non-time-traveler, but, as most of the characters travel through time, this leads to the chapters defying the conventional order.
*''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] has its 18 chapters labelled as episodes, with 3 books split between them.

==Book-like==
In [[ancient civilization]]s, books were often in the form of [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] [[scroll]]s, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as "Book 1", "Book 2" etc.

In the early printed era, long works were often published in multiple volumes, such as the Victorian [[Three-volume novel|triple decker novel]], each divided into numerous chapters. Modern omnibus reprints will often retain the volume divisions. In some cases the chapters will be numbered consecutively all the way through, such that "Book 2" might begin with "Chapter 9", but in other cases the numbering might reset after each part (i.e., "Book 2, Chapter 1"). Even though the practice of dividing novels into separate volumes is rare in modern publishing, many authors still structure their works into "Books" or "Parts" and then subdivide them into chapters. A notable example of this is [[The Lord of the Rings]] which consists of six 'Books', each with a recognizable part of the story, although it is usually published in three volumes.

'''Charles Edenshaw''' (ca. 1839–1920) was a [[Haida people|Haida]] artist&lt;ref name=amnh&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/totems/masters/edenshaw.php "Master Artists: Charles Edenshaw."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124101447/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/totems/masters/edenshaw.php |date=24 November 2009 }} ''American Museum of Natural History.'' (retrieved 3 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Haida Gwaii]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. He is known for his woodcarving, [[Haida argillite carving|argillite carving]], jewellery, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;HAND TO HAND:The Legacy of Charles Edenshaw DVD 2005 Ravens and Eagles Productions, www.urbanrez.ca&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}

==Background==
Edensew (the name also spelled Edensaw, or Edenso from the Haida chiefly name ''Idɨnsaw'') was born at the Haida village of [[Skidegate]], on Haida Gwaii, located 27 miles off of the coast of [[British Columbia]] Canada.  His father was K'łajangk'una of the Nikwən Qiwe lineage of the Raven moiety.  His mother, whose lineage identity he followed in the Haida matrilineal system, was Qawkúna (later Mrs. John Robson) of the Eagle moiety's Sdəłdás lineage, of which Charles eventually became chief.  He spent his early years at Kiusta and Yatza in the northwestern Charlottes, i.e. the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii). His Haida name was ''Da.a xiigang''&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt; or Tahaygen, alternatively spelled Tahayren and Tahayghen.&lt;ref name=CMCGoldenAge&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haaat04e.shtml | title=Artists – Golden Age: Charles Edenshaw | publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] | accessdate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ago.net/agoid24961 | publisher=[[Art Gallery of Ontario]] | title=Charles Edenshaw (Tahayghen). Model Totem Pole | accessdate=13 January 2010 | date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned from his uncle, the Eagle chief Albert Edward Edenshaw.  In 1884 he was baptised with his English name, which derived from Scotland's [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]].

In addition to the chiefly name Idɨnsaw, he also held the titles Skɨl'wxan jas ("Fairies Coming to You as in a Big Wave"), Dahʼégɨn ("Noise in the Housepit"), Nəngkwigetklałs ("They Gave Ten Potlatches for Him").

==Artworks==
He produced many commissioned works, including for the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt; His work is in many museum collections, and he served as consultant to many anthropologists.  His works include [[bentwood]] boxes, rattles, masks, [[totem poles]], and staffs, and he worked in wood, [[argillite]], gold, and silver.  His work was collected by the anthropologists [[Franz Boas]] and [[John R. Swanton]].

He is specifically credited for advancing gold and silver engraving in traditional formline design.&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt;

==Family==
Edenshaw's marriage to [[Isabella Edenshaw]] (Yahgujanaas) was part of a long pattern of intermarriage between these two prominent Haida lineages. Together they parented four daughters (in chronological order): Emily (White), Agnus (Yeltatzie), Florence (Davidson), and Nora (Cogo).

Through his daughter Emily, Edenshaw is great-grandfather to the contemporary artists [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas]], [[Jim Hart (Haida Artist)|Jim Hart]] and [[Lisa Hageman Yahgulanaas]] and great-great grandfather to many Haida artists. Edenshaw's daughter was the matriarch [[Florence Davidson]], and is great grandfather to internationally renowned artists [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]], and [[Reg Davidson]], and through Florence, he is grandfather to her daughter, the weaving artist [[Primrose Adams]],&lt;ref name="STONINGTON"&gt;{{cite web|title=Primrose Adams Bio|url=http://www.stoningtongallery.com/artistselect.php?fn=Primrose&amp;ln=Adams&amp;artist=118&amp;artType=4&amp;topic=bio|website=Stonington Gallery|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; great-grandfather to her daughter the weaving artist Isabel Rorick.

The '''concertmaster''' (from the [[German language|German]] '''''Konzertmeister''''') in the U.S. and Canada is the leader of the first violin section in an orchestra (or clarinet in a concert band) and the instrument-playing leader of the orchestra. After the conductor, the concertmaster is the second-most significant leader in an [[orchestra]], [[symphonic band]] or other [[musical ensemble]].  Another common term in the U.S. is "First Chair." In the U.K., Australia and elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the term commonly used is "leader."

== Orchestra ==

In an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first [[violin]] section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a [[concerto]], in which case a guest soloist usually plays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm655.org/item/the-role-of-the-concertmaster/catid/10 |title=The role of the Concertmaster |publisher=South Florida Musicians}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by their playing and bow gestures.

The concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the "first chair," "first [music] stand" or outside of the US "first desk." (In one instance, [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] had been concertmaster of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] since [[Felix Mendelssohn]] became conductor in 1835. In 1847, [[Joseph Joachim]] joined David on the first desk.) The concertmaster makes decisions regarding [[Bow (music)|bowing]] and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. They lead the orchestra in [[Musical tuning|tuning]] before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Classical Orchestra |url=http://www.camasb.org/yad/yad-orchestra.shtml |publisher=Community Arts Music Association |accessdate=15 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206174144/http://www.camasb.org/yad/yad-orchestra.shtml|archive-date=6 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the orchestral tuning is not a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, they will signal to the [[oboe]] player to play another "A." Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence.

The concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the [[audition]]s of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.

== Other large ensembles ==

In a standard [[concert band]], the concertmaster is the principal [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], or [[flute]] and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead [[flautist]] will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.

In [[brass bands]], the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo [[cornet]] or [[trumpet]].

== Duties ==

The duties and tasks of the concertmaster are myriad. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties.

One of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece.

Another primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is, often (unless he or she is a string player), a generalist.

Full-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra.  
  
In performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated, and bow and receive applause before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, the concertmaster will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''Copyright formalities''' are legal (generally [[statutory law|statutory]]) requirements needed to obtain a [[copyright]] in a particular jurisdiction. Common copyright formalities include [[copyright registration]], [[copyright renewal]], [[copyright notice]], and [[copyright deposit]].

==Benefits and critiques==
Copyright formalities had certain benefits to users and holders of copyrights.  First, they made determination of copyright status fairly easy.  Copyright notice requirements—such as placing a notice of copyright on the work itself, along with the copyright holder, and the date of copyright—meant that any work could readily be determined to be in copyright simply by looking for the copyright notice.  Copyright registration and renewal requirements meant that records of copyright owners were centrally located and made available; this facilitated licensing arrangements, and contacting the holders.  It also provided authoritative records about who owned the copyright, in case of disputes. 

However, copyright formalities were viewed as an unnecessary burden on creators—mostly authors at the end of the 19th century.  Authors who failed to comply with some particular aspect of a formality—for instance, placing the notice in the wrong place or in the wrong order, or failing to renew a copyright in a timely fashion—would lose their copyright.  Consequently, [[Victor Hugo]] and other authors agitated for the elimination of copyright formalities toward the end of the 19th century.  In response to their efforts, the 1908 Berlin text of the [[Berne Convention]] forbade treaty signatories from conditioning copyright on formalities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=Paul |title=International Copyright: Principles, Law, and Practice |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195128850 |oclc=43411605 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; shifting copyright from a system of application (registration) to automatic copyright on fixation.

== Shift away from formalities==
Requirements for meeting copyright formalities were largely eliminated in many countries with the adoption of the [[Berne Convention]], which granted a copyright for a creative work automatically as soon as the work was "[[copyright fixation|fixed]]".  Berne was first adopted in 1886 by eight countries, mostly in Europe.  Acceptance grew over the course of the 20th century. (See [[List of parties to the Berne Convention]].)  The United States, a notable late holdout, joined Berne effective March 1, 1989, with the passage of the [[Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988]]; China, another notable holdout, joined Berne in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of parties to the Berne Convention]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

With the adoption of Berne and its successor treaties, requiring formalities to obtain a copyright has fallen out of practice around the world.

== Renewed interest in formalities==
However, the system of automatic copyright on fixation has been cited as one of the factors behind the growth of the so-called "[[orphan works]]" problem.  For instance, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]]'s 2006 report on orphan works cited the shift away from formalities as one of the critical factors behind the creation of orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;United States Copyright Office, [http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat030806.html Copyright Office's Report on Orphan Works] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Consequently, some scholars and policy advocates (such as law professor and activist [[Lawrence Lessig]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'' by [[Larry Lessig]].&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. [[Zoe Lofgren|Representative Zoe Lofgren]]) have called for returning to a system of registration requirements and possibly other formalities such as [[copyright notice]].  UC Berkeley's Law School held a conference in 2013 on the question of "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?", noting that &lt;blockquote&gt;"Formalities, which in the past three decades have largely disappeared from American copyright law, may be about to stage a comeback. ... [R]ecent research on formalities suggests that we can get many of the benefits that formalities promise for a more efficient and focused copyright law, without the problems that led us to do away with them in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/bclt/past-events/2013-conferences/april013-copyright-formalities/ "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?"], [[Berkeley School of Law]], April 18–19, 2013, Claremont Hotel, Berkeley CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''Death and the Maiden'''" is a song by New Zealand rock band [[The Verlaines]]. It was released as a single in 1983 and is arguably the most popular song in their discography.
The 'B' side of the record was ''CD, Jimmy Jazz &amp; Me''.

"Death and the Maiden" later appeared on the 1987 album ''Juvenilia'', which was a collection of The Verlaines early singles and EP's.

New Zealand rock band [[Elemeno P]] released a cover version of this song on their 2005 album ''[[Trouble In Paradise (Elemeno P album)|Trouble in Paradise]]''. Former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] frontman [[Stephen Malkmus]] also recorded a version for the [[Flying Nun Records|Flying Nun]] tribute album ''[[Under the Influence - 21 Years of Flying Nun Records]]'' in 2002.  Boston band Prickly covered the song on their 1997 LP ''Velleity.''

==Meaning of the lyrics==
[[File:Egon Schiele 012.jpg|thumb|''Death and the Maiden'' by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
''You'll only end up like Rimbaud''&lt;br&gt;''Get shot by Verlaine, Verlaine, Verlaine, Verlaine....''&lt;br&gt;
The lyrics above refer to [[Paul Verlaine]], a 19th-century French poet. After going into a drunken rage, Verlaine shot his lover – fellow poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] in July 1873.  The Verlaines took their name from the French poet.

''Shall we have our photo taken?''&lt;br&gt;''We'll look like Death and the Maiden''&lt;br&gt; 
This is a reference to a painting of the same name by [[Egon Schiele]], which shows a woman embracing a skeleton. The image is reproduced on the label of Verlaines' side of the "Dunedin Double" EP, issued in 1982 (the year before the release of "Death and the Maiden".

==In the media==
*Featured in New Zealand movie ''[[Scarfies]]'' and on its soundtrack release.

[[File:Design Management in brief.jpg|thumb|Design management is the business side of design. Design managers need to speak the language of the business and the language of design.]]
'''Design management''' is a field of inquiry that uses [[project management]], [[design]], strategy, and [[supply chain]] techniques to control a [[creative process]], support a culture of [[creativity]], and build a structure and organization for design. The objective of design management is to develop and maintain an efficient business environment in which an organization can achieve its [[Strategic planning|strategic]] and [[mission statement|mission]] goals through design. Design management is a comprehensive activity at all levels of business (operational to strategic), from the discovery phase to the execution phase. "Simply put, design management is the business side of design. Design management encompasses the ongoing [[Business process|processes]], business decisions, and [[strategies]] that enable innovation and create effectively-designed [[Product (business)|products]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[communications]], [[Social environment|environments]], and [[brands]] that enhance our quality of life and provide organizational success."&lt;ref name="DMI2010web" /&gt; The discipline of design management overlaps with [[marketing management]], [[operations management]], and [[strategic management]].

Traditionally, design management was seen as limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of [[design thinking]] into [[strategic management]] as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive mode of inference]], compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.&lt;ref name="jones_2008" /&gt;

Design has become a strategic asset in [[brand equity]], differentiation, and product quality for many companies. More and more organizations apply design management to improve design-relevant activities and to better connect design with corporate strategy.

==Extended definition==
[[File:Dm-definition.pdf|thumb|right| Design management plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organization and market.]]
The multifaceted nature of design management leads to varied opinion,&lt;ref name="Koppelmann1993" /&gt; making it difficult to give an overall definition; furthermore, design managers have a broad range of roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market situation, and the importance of design within the organization's activities. As a result, design management is not restricted to a single design discipline and usually depends on the context of its application within an individual organization.

On an abstract level, design management plays three key roles in the interface of design, organization, and market. The three key roles are to:

# Align design strategy with corporate or brand strategy, or both
# Manage quality and consistency of design outcomes across and within different design disciplines (design classes)
# Enhance new methods of user experience, create new solutions for user needs and differentiation from competitor's designs

===Additional definitions===
{{quote|Design management is the effective deployment by line managers of the design resources available to an organization in the pursuance of its corporate objectives. It is therefore directly concerned with the organizational place of design, with the identification with specific design disciplines which are relevant to the resolution of key management issues, and with the training of managers to use design effectively.|Peter Gorb&lt;ref name="Peter Gorb" /&gt;}}
{{quote|Design management is a complex and multi-faceted activity that goes right to the heart of what a company is or does [...] it is not something susceptible to pat formulas, a few bullet points or a manual. Every company's structure and internal culture is different; design management is no exception. But the fact that every firm is different does not diminish the importance of managing design tightly and effectively.|John Thackara&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p139" /&gt;}}

==Definition of related terms==

===Design===
{{Main|Design}}
Unlike unique sciences such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or discipline of design is not brought to a generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex and the nature of design is still the subject of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ralph2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holm2006" /&gt; In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as ''intuition''. In his ''Classification of Design'' (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. [[industrial design]], packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).&lt;ref name="Gorb1988" /&gt;

===Management===
{{Main|Management}}
Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], [[Human resources|staffing]], [[leadership|leading]] or directing, and [[Control (management)|controlling]] an [[organization]] (a group of one or more people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal.&lt;ref name="Fayol1841-1925" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunod1966" /&gt; [[Human resources|Resourcing]] encompasses the deployment and manipulation of [[human resources]], [[financial]] resources, [[technological]] resources, and [[natural resources]]. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely [[human resources|human resource]] management, [[operations management]] (or production management), [[strategic management]], [[marketing management]], [[Corporate finance|financial management]], and [[information technology management]], which was responsible for [[management information systems]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches [[marketing management]], [[operations management]], and [[strategic management]].

===Design leadership===
Design managers often operate in the area of [[design leadership]]; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.&lt;ref name="Turner2002" /&gt;

==History==
Difficulties arise in tracing the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964,&lt;ref name="M-Farr1965" /&gt; earlier contributions created the context in which the expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines: architecture, [[industrial design]], management, software development, engineering; and movements such as [[system theory]], [[Design methodology|design methodologies]]. It cannot be attributed directly to either design or to management.

===Business===

====Managing product aesthetics and corporate design (early contributions)====
[[File:Peter Behrens, um 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Behrens]], around 1913 in his office in Berlin, was one of the first contributors to design management.]]
Early contributions to design management show how different design disciplines were coordinated to achieve business objectives at a corporate level, and demonstrate the early understanding of design as a competitive force. In that context, design was merely understood as an aesthetic function, and the management of design was at the level of project planning.

The practice of managing design to achieve a business objective was first documented in 1907. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) was established in [[Munich]] by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1996" /&gt; A German designer and architect, [[Peter Behrens]], created the entire [[corporate identity]] (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of [[AEG|Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft]] (AEG), and is regarded as the first [[industrial design]]er in history.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989p358" /&gt;

In the following years, companies applied the principles of corporate identity and [[corporate design]] to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. [[Olivetti]] became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities.&lt;ref name="Woodham1997" /&gt; In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted [[Marcello Nizzoli]] from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]], CEO of [[IBM]], retained American architect and industrial designer [[Eliot Noyes]] to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of [[Paul Rand]] and [[Charles Eames]] as consultants, is considered to be the first comprehensive corporate design program in America.&lt;ref name=Noyes&gt;Bruce, G., (2006) ''Eliot Noyes'', London: Phaidon Press Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on [[ergonomics]], functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed [[Just-in-time (business)|Just in time]], [[Total quality management]], and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, [[Bauhaus]], [[Ulm School of Design|HfG Ulm]], the [[Design Council|British Design Council]], Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and [[Walter Paepcke]].&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989p358" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noyes/&gt;

====Managing design systematically (1960s–1970s)====
The work of designers in the 1960s was influenced by industry, as the debate on design evolved from an aesthetic function into active cooperation with industry. Designers had to work in a team with engineers and marketers, and design was perceived as one part of the product development process. In the early years, design management was strongly influenced by system science and the emergence of a [[Design Science|design science]] (e.g. the "blooming period of [[Design methodology|design methodologies]]" in Germany, the US, and Great Britain), as its main contributors had backgrounds in architecture. Early discussions on design management were strongly influenced by Anglo-Saxon literature (e.g. [http://www.kengarland.co.uk/KGA-graphic-design/michael-farr/ Farr] and [[Horst Rittel]]), methodological studies in [[Design Research]] (e.g. [[Ulm School of Design|HfG Ulm]] and [[Christopher Alexander]]), and theories in business studies. Design management dealt with two main issues:
* how to develop corporate systems of planning aims
* how to solve problems of methodological [[information processing]]

Instruments and checklists were developed to structure the processes and decisions of companies for successful [[corporate development]].&lt;ref name="Geyer1970p35"/&gt; In this period the main contributors to design management were Michael Farr, Horst Rittel, HfG Ulm, Christopher Alexander, James Pilditch, the [[London Business School]], Peter Gorb, the Design Management Institute, and the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. Debates in design disciplines were focusing on design science, design methodology, [[wicked problems]],&lt;ref name="wicked_problem" group="note" /&gt; Ulm methodology, the relationship of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41373058 design and business], new German design, and semiotic and scenario technique.

====Managing design as a strategic asset (1980s–1990s)====
In the 1980s several managers realized the economic effect of design,&lt;ref name="Kicherer1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spieß1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rummel1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meier-Kortwig1997" /&gt;&lt;!--Are all these refs really necessary?--&gt; which increased the demand for design management. As companies were unsure how to manage design, there was a market for consultancy; focusing on helping organizations manage the product development process, including [[market research]], product concepts, projects, communications, and market launch phases—as well as the positioning of products and companies.

Three important works were published in 1990: the ''Publication of Design Management – A Handbook of Issues and Methods''&lt;ref name="Oakley1990" /&gt; by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book ''Design Management''&lt;ref name="Mozota1990" /&gt; by French researcher [[Brigitte Borja de Mozota]], and the ''Publication of Design Management – Papers from the London Business School''&lt;ref name="Gorb1990" /&gt; by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.

In the management community the topics of management theory, positioning strategy, brand management, strategic management, advertisement, competitive strategy, leadership, business ethics, mass customization, core competencies, strategic intent, reputation management, and system theory were discussed. Main issues and debates in design management included the topics of design leadership, design thinking, and corporate identity; plus the involvement of design management at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels.

In 1980 Robert Blaich, the senior managing director of design at [[Philips]], introduced a design management system that regards design, production, and marketing as a single unit.&lt;ref name="reddot2004" /&gt; This was an important contribution to the definition of design as a core element in business. At [[Philips Design]], Stefano Marzano became CEO and Chief Creative Director in 1991, continuing the work of Robert Blaich to align design processes with business processes and furthering design strategy as an important asset of the overall business strategy.

Upon being appointed corporate head of the IBM Design Program in 1989, [[Tom Hardy (designer)|Tom Hardy]], initiated a strategic design management effort, in collaboration with IBM design consultant [[Richard Sapper]], to return to the roots of the IBM Design Program first established in 1956 by [[Eliot Noyes]], [[Paul Rand]] and [[Charles Eames]]. The intent was to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM [[ThinkPad]] was the first product to emerge from this strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, B., ″Hot Products: Smart Design is the Common Thread″, ''Business Week'', June 7, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sakakibara&gt;Sakakibara, K., “IBM ThinkPad 700C Notebook Computer Case″, ''Centre for Design Management - London Business School'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dell, D.; Purdy, G., (1999) ''ThinkPad: A Different Shade of Blue'', Indianapolis: Sams/Mcmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, T., “Rebuilding Trust: Design Saves the Brand″, ''Innovation'', Summer 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, T., “Innovation &amp; Chaos”, ''Design Management Journal'', Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metz, C., ″25 Years of PC Magazine: Year Eleven/1992″, ''PC Magazine'', May 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consultant following his 22-year tenure at IBM, [[Tom Hardy (designer)|Hardy]] served as Corporate Design Advisor to [[Samsung]] &lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C.;  Engardio, P.; Ihlwan, M., "The Samsung Way", ''Business Week'', June 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, K.; Freeze, K., “Design Strategy at Samsung Electronics: Becoming a Top-Tier Company″, ''Design Management Institute Case Study - Harvard Business School Publishing'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1996-2003 where his integration of a brand-design philosophy and guiding principles, together with a comprehensive design management system, became a strategic corporate asset &lt;ref&gt;Delaney, M.; Hardy, T.; McFarland, J.; Yoon, G., ″Global Localization″, ''Innovation'', Summer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, R.; Kumar, K., ″Capturing Value in Global Markets: The Case of Samsung Electronics″, ''SCMS Journal of Indian Management - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore'', October - December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, L., "From Cheap to WOW", ''Case Study, Thunderbird School of Global Management'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; that significantly helped elevate Samsung's image from follower to global brand-design leader and dramatically increased brand equity value.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, B.; Ihlwan, M., ″Cool Korea″ [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_23/b3786002.htm], '' Business Week'', June 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, K.; Hardy, T.; So, S., ″Strategic Realization″ [http://www.dmi.org/dmi/html/publications/journal/fullabstract_d.jsp?itemID=00111HAR65], ''Design Management Journal'', Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, B., “The Hungriest Tiger”, ''Business Week'', June 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Managing design for innovation (2000s–2010s)====
Design management has taken a more strategic role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for design management have been established. Design management has been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the [[European Union]] as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations.&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kootstra2009" /&gt; The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management was influenced by the following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.&lt;ref name="Lockwood2009" /&gt;

===Notion of the term "design management"===
In 1965 the term ''design management'' was first published in a series of articles in the ''Design Journal''. This series includes a pre-publication&lt;ref name="M-Farr1965" /&gt; of the first chapter of the book ''Design Management'' by Michael Farr,&lt;ref name="Farr1996p4" /&gt; which is considered as the first comprehensive literature on design management. His thoughts on [[system theory]] and [[project management]] led to a framework on how to deal with design as a business function at the [[corporate management]] level by providing the language and methodology to effectively manage it.&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989" /&gt;

The term "[[architectural management]]" was coined by the architects Brunton, Baden Hellard and Boobyer in 1964 where they highlighted the tension and synergy between the management of individual projects (job management) and the management of the business (office management).&lt;ref name="Brunton1964" /&gt; Although they did not use the term "design management", they stressed identical issues; while the design community discussed methodologies for design. Christopher Alexander's work played an important role in the development of the design methodology, where he devoted his attention to the problems of form and context; and focused on disassembling complex design challenges into constituent parts to approach a solution. His intention was to bring more rationalism and structure into the solving of design problems.

===Design Policy (up to 2000s)===
[[File:Design Council - Bow Street 1.jpg|thumb|The '''British Design Council''' was founded in 1944 to promote design in the British industry.]]
Design policies have a history reaching back to the end of the 19th century, when design programs with roots in the crafts sector were implemented in Sweden (1845) and Finland (1875).&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt; In 1907 the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) was established in [[Munich]] to better compete with Great Britain and United States. The success of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] inspired a group of British designers, industrialists and business people after they had seen the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne in 1914, to found the Design and Industries Association and campaign for a greater involvement of government in the promotion of good design.&lt;ref name="Brighton" /&gt; In 1944 design management by managing design policies was used by the British Government. The British Design Council was founded by Hugh Dalton, president of the Board of Trade in the British wartime government, as the [[Council of Industrial Design]] with the objective "to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry".

Germany also realized the national importance of design during World War II. Between 1933 and 1945 [[Adolf Hitler]] used design, architecture and propaganda to increase his power; shown through the annual [[Reichsparteitage]] in [[Nürnberg]] on September 5. [[Heinrich Himmler]] coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including: the all-black SS-uniform designed by Professor [[Karl Diebitsch]] and Walter Heck in 1933; the [[Dachau concentration camp]], designed by [[Theodor Eicke]], and prototypes for other [[Nazi concentration camps]]; and the [[Wewelsburg]] redesign commissioned by Heinrich Himmler in 1944.

Since the 1990s the practice of design promotion evolved, and governments have used policy management and design management to promote design as part of their efforts of fostering technology, manufacturing and innovation.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt;

===Promotion and conference (till 2000s)===
[[File:DMI conference.jpg|thumb|right|The 15th European International '''Design Management Conference''' organized by the Design Management Institute]]

In America the [[Chicago]] industrialist [[Walter Paepcke]], of the [[Container Corporation of America]], founded the Aspen Design Conference after World War II as a way of bringing business and designers together – to the benefit of both. In 1951 the first conference topic, "Design as a function of management", was chosen to ensure the participation of the business community. After several years, business leaders stopped attending because the increased participation of designers changed the dialogue, focusing not on the need for collaboration between business and design, but rather on the business community's failure to understand the value of design.&lt;ref name="aspen2011" /&gt;

The [[Royal Society of Arts]] (RSA) Presidential Medals for Design Management were instituted in June 1964. These were to recognize outstanding examples of design policy in organizations that maintained a consistently high standard in all aspects of design management, throughout all industries and disciplines. With these awards the RSA introduced the term ''design management''. In 1965 the first medals were given to four companies; Conran &amp; Co Ltd, Jaeger &amp; Co Ltd, [[Hille (furniture)|S. Hille &amp; Co Ltd]] and W. &amp; A. Gilbey Ltd.&lt;ref name="Cheetman1965" /&gt; in the category "current achievements" and two companies [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5note" group="note" /&gt; and Heal and Son Ltd.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v7note" group="note" /&gt; in the category "long pioneering in the field of design management". The medal selection committee included representatives of the RSA council and the faculty of [[Royal Designers for Industry]].

The Design Management Institute (DMI) was founded in 1975 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] in [[Boston]]. Since the mid-1980s the DMI has been an international [[non-profit organization]] that seeks to heighten the awareness of design as an essential part of [[business strategy]], and become the leading resource and international authority on design management. One year later the first conference was organized. The DMI increased its international presence and established the "European International Conference on Design Management" in 1997, and a professional development program for design management.&lt;ref name="DMI2010web" /&gt;

In 2007 the [[European Commission]] funded the Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises (ADMIRE) project for two years, as part of the Pro Inno Europe Initiative, which is the EU's "focal point for innovation policy analysis, learning and development". The aim was to encourage companies – especially [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) – to introduce design management procedures to; improve their competitiveness, stimulate innovation, establish a European knowledge-sharing platform, organize the [[Design Management Europe Award]], and to identify and test new activities to promote Design Management.&lt;ref name="EU2009" /&gt;

===Education (1970s on)===
[[File:London - The Royal Society of Arts.jpg|thumb|The '''Royal Society of Arts''' in London is one of the first institutions supporting design management.]]
Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the [[London Business School]] (LBS) in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|date=1987|title=Projects Not Cases: Teaching Design to Managers|url=http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/18/4/299|journal=Management Learning|doi=10.1177/135050768701800408|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Peter Gorb (1926-2013), the first Honorary Fellow of the DMI and a long-standing Fellow of the RSA. Gorb had previously embedded design management in the Burton Retail Group before joining LBS where he later founded the Design Management Unit in 1982 (in collaboration with Charles Handy) which he led for over 20 years. In 1979 his talk at the RSA entitled ''Design and its Use by Managers''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|date=1980|title=Design and its Use to Managers|jstor=41373058|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|volume=128|issue=5283|pages=144–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, an appreciation of the power of design as a management resource, and advocated the teaching of design to managers.&lt;ref&gt;Gorb, Peter (1986) The Business of Design Management, Design Studies, Volume 7, Issue 2, pp.106-110 https://doi.org/10.1016/0142-694X(86)90023-2&lt;/ref&gt; Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design Management Unit at LBS, ''Design Talks'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design Talks|last=Gorb|first=Peter|publisher=Design Council|year=1988|isbn=0850722187|location=UK|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1988) with Eric Schneider and ''Design Management: Papers from the London Business School'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design Management: Papers from the London Business School|last=Gorb|first=Peter|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=1990|isbn=1854541536|location=UK|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|last2=Dumas|first2=Angela|date=1987-07-01|title=Silent design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0142694X87900378|journal=Design Studies|volume=8|issue=3|pages=150–156|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(87)90037-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).

In 1991 the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] founded the Institute of Design Leadership and Management and established an international training program.&lt;ref name="TAIKweb2010" /&gt; The International Design Management Conference was organized in the same year by them.&lt;ref name="TAIKconf1995note" group="note" /&gt; In 1995 the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (HSE), University of Art and Design Helsinki (TaiK), and [[University of Technology]] (TKK) cooperated to create the International Design Business Management Program ([[IDBM]]), which aims to bring together experts from different fields within the concept of design business management.&lt;ref name="Karjalainen2008" /&gt;

===Research===
The first international research project on design management, the TRIAD research project, was initiated by Earl Powell, then president of DMI and the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1989. In the same year Earl Powell and Thomas Walton, Ph.D. developed the Design Management Review and DMI published the first issue. The publication is solely focusing on design management and has become the flagship publication of the discipline.&lt;ref name="TRIAD1989" /&gt;

Design and design management have experienced different generations of theories. In its first generation design focused on the object, in the second on the process, and in the third on the user.&lt;ref name="Findeli2005" /&gt; Similar shifts can be seen in management and design management in almost parallel steps. For design management this has been illustrated by Brigitte Borja de Mozota,&lt;ref name="Mozota2006" /&gt; using Findeli's Bremen Model as a framework. Design management research organised itself into:&lt;ref name="mozota2002" /&gt;
* Organizational studies: design in an economic sector&lt;ref name="designstudies_economic" group="note" /&gt; or design in large firms, such as Philips or Olivetti&lt;ref name="designstudies_companies" group="note" /&gt;
* Descriptive studies of specific methods of design management&lt;ref name="designstudies_descriptive" group="note" /&gt;
It is difficult to predict where design management research is heading.&lt;ref name="Johansson2008" /&gt;

==Different types==
Different types of design management depend on the type and strategic orientation of the business.

===Product design management===
[[File:Saab hockey stick.jpg|thumb|'''Product design management''' helps to create a distinctive design. The [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] hockey stick is an automotive design feature.]]
In product-focused companies, design management focuses mainly on product design management, including strong interactions with product design, product marketing, research and development, and new product development. This perspective of design management is mainly focused on the aesthetic, semiotic, and ergonomic aspects of the product to express the product's qualities and to manage diverse product groups and product design platforms&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; and can be applied together with a [[user-centered design]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Simeone2014" /&gt;

===Brand design management===
In market and brand focused companies, design management focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand as the core for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The design is driven by the brand vision and strategy.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

;Corporate brand design management

Market and brand focused organizations are concerned with the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

;Product brand design management

The main focus of product brand management lies on the single product or product family. Product design management is linked to research and development, marketing, and brand management, and is present in the [[fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG) industry. It is responsible for the visual expressions of the individual product brand, with its diverse customer–brand touch points and the execution of the brand through design.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

===Service design management===
[[File:Car2Go in Austin.jpg|thumb|'''Service design management''' deals with the newly emerging discipline of service design. An example is the [[Car2Go]] concept from [[Daimler AG]], as seen in [[Austin, Texas]].]]
Service design management deals with the newly emerging field of [[service design]]. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim is to improve the quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.

Companies in the service sector innovate by addressing the intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability of service (the IHIP challenge):&lt;ref name="Regan1963" /&gt;
* Services are ''intangible''; they have no physical form and they cannot be seen before purchase or taken home.
* Services are ''heterogenous''; unlike tangible products, no two service delivery experiences are alike.
* Services are ''inseparable''; the act of supplying a service is inseparable from the customer's act of consuming it.
* Services are ''perishable''; they can not be inventoried.

Service design management differs in several ways from product design management. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult&lt;ref name="Morelli2006" /&gt; because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires the development of new tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency&lt;ref name="Lovelock2001" /&gt; and effective cost control.

===Business design management===
{{Main|Design thinking}}
[[File:Business Model Canvas.png|thumb|right|'''Business design management''' is used in the development of business models. The business model canvas by Alexander Osterwalder.]]
Business design management deals with the newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / [[Anthropology]] (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional [[Mathematic]]s / [[Economic]]s / [[Psychology]] (M/E/P) management paradigm.&lt;ref name="jones_2008"/&gt; Since 2006, the term ''Business Design'' is trademarked by the [[Rotman School of Management]]; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that is characterized by a deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business design management activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the [[Aalto University]] in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.&lt;ref name="TAIKweb2010" /&gt;

===Engineering design management===
Engineering Design Management is a knowledge area within engineering management. It represents the adaptation and application of customary management practices, with the intention of achieving a productive [engineering design process]. Engineering design management is primarily applied in the context of engineering design teams, whereby the activities, outputs and influences of design teams are planned, guided, monitored and controlled. The output of an engineering design process &lt;ref name="Ertas1996"/&gt; is ultimately a description of a technical system.&lt;ref name=Hubka1996 /&gt; That technical system may either be an artifact (technical object), production facility, a process plant or any infrastructure for the benefit of society. Therefore, the domain of engineering design management includes high volume, mass production as well as low-volume, infrastructure.

===Urban design management===
[[File:HafenCity Hafengeburtstag 2009c.jpg|thumb|'''Urban design management''' contributes to the development of urban districts. The newly built [[HafenCity]], [[Hamburg]], Germany.]]
[[Urban design]] management involves mediation among a range of self-interested stakeholders engaged in the production of the [[built environment]]. Such mediation can encourage a joint search for mutually beneficial outcomes or integrative development. Integrative development aims to produce sustainable solutions by increasing stakeholder satisfaction with the process and with the resulting [[urban development]].&lt;ref name="Edelman2007" /&gt;

Conventional [[real estate development]] and [[urban planning]] activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not been used as a coordinated approach to real estate development, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.&lt;ref name="Ahlava2008" /&gt;

Urban design management offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities in a way that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban design management provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.

The work on ''Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building''&lt;ref name="Susskind1999" /&gt; and the ''[[Mutual Gains Approach]]''&lt;ref name="Susskind1996" /&gt; provide a helpful theoretical framework for developing the theory of urban design management. [[Negotiation theory]] provides a useful framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. ''Interests'', a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and William Ury (1981), ''Getting to yes'', advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.&lt;ref name="Fisher1981" /&gt;

===Architectural management===

[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 - Departures.jpg|thumb|'''Architectural design management''' contributed to the development of [[Heathrow Terminal 5]] and [[Heathrow Express]] by managing the design development and applying visionary leadership.]]
Architectural management can be defined as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice.&lt;ref name="managearchitecture2010" /&gt; The term ''architectural management'' has been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Brunton1964" /&gt; The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared to be concerned about the conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or [[practice management]] and [[project management]]. [[Office management]] provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the [[design process]], construction, and project management, through to [[Facility management|facilities management]] of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Emmitt2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmitt2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmitt2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boissevain1995" /&gt;

==Business==

===Value for business===
Design plays a vital role in product and brand development, and is of great economic importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the [[creative industries]]' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture_note" group="note" /&gt;

The increasing importance of creative industries (and especially design) in knowledge-intense industries is reflected not only in the policies and studies on EU levels, but has initiated design and creative policies and programmes in the most advanced economies. Furthermore, design and creativity has been recognised on a regional and local level as a driving force for competitiveness, economic growth, job market, and citizen's satisfaction. The investment in creative and cultural industries are considered a significant component of EU growth in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy;&lt;ref name="OMC2010" /&gt; and designers are increasingly involved in innovation issues.

To better understand the value of design and its role in innovation, the EU holds a public consultation on the basis of their publication ''Design as a driver of user-centred innovation''&lt;ref name="EU2009" /&gt; and have published the mini-study ''Design as a tool for innovation''.&lt;ref name="Thenint2008" /&gt; The report highlights the importance of design in user-centred innovation and recommends the integration of design into the EU innovation policy. In addition to the design share in the export of all creative industry products, design can also have a positive impact on all business performance indicators; from turnover and profit to market share and competitiveness.&lt;ref name="designfactfinder2011" /&gt; Design management research results can be classified as follows:&lt;ref name="mozota2002" /&gt;
* Design improves the performance of the innovation policy and of the communications policy of the firm&lt;ref name="designvalue_performance" group="note" /&gt;
* Design improves the global performance of the firm; it is a profitable investment&lt;ref name="designvalue_profit" group="note" /&gt;
* Design is a profession that creates value on a macro economic level&lt;ref name="designvalue_macrolevel" group="note" /&gt;
* Design improves the competitive edge of a country in the international competition; it develops exports&lt;ref name="designvalue_export" group="note" /&gt;
* Design can help the restructuring of an economic sector in regional economic policy &lt;ref name="designvalue_economy" group="note" /&gt;

If and how design management is applied in a company correlates with the importance and integration of design in the company, but depends also on industry type, company size, ownership for design and type of competitive competence. A research from the Danish Design Centre (DDC) led to the "Danish Design Ladder", which shows how companies interpreted and applied design in differing depth:&lt;ref name="DDC2011" /&gt;
# Non-design: Companies that do not use design (15% in 2007).
# Design as styling: Companies that use design as styling appearance (17% in 2007).
# Design as process: Companies that integrate design into the development process (45% in 2007).
# Design as innovation: Companies that consider design as key strategic element (21% in 2007).
The research showed that companies that considered design on a higher level of the ladder were constantly growing. Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an ''Evaluation of the Importance of Design'' in 2006, with the result that most companies considered design as a promoter for innovation (71%), as a growth potential for the company (79%), and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.

The value of design can be leveraged if it is managed well. Research by Chiva and Alegre shows that there is no link between the level of design investment and business success, but instead a strong correlation between design management skills and business success.&lt;ref name="Chiva2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh1988" /&gt; This means that efficient and effective design management is crucial for maximising the value of design. Effective design management increases the efficiency of operations and process management, has a significant positive impact on process management, improves quality performance (internal and external quality), and increases operating performance.&lt;ref name="Ahire2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaynak2003" /&gt; To measure and communicate the value of design management, Borja de Mozota suggests adapting the Balanced Score Card model and structuring the values in the following four categories:&lt;ref name="Mozota2006" /&gt;
* Internal business processes: Design management as an innovation process, providing improvements in company performance and processes. Here, these innovations and processes are totally invisible to outsiders.
* Learning and growing: Beyond advanced design management. Design explicit knowledge is applied to strategic focus and improves the quality of staff.
* Customer and brand: Design management as perception and brand. Design knowledge is applied to corporate difference building and strategic positioning.
* Financial: The historic design management economic model. Design management as an explicit and measurable value for company reputation and stock market performance.

===Relation to other disciplines and departments===
Three different orientations for the choice of design management can be identified in companies. These orientations influence the perception of management and the responsibility of design managers within the organisation. The strategic orientations are; market focus, product focus and brand focus.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;
* Product-driven organisations often have design responsibility in their research and development (R&amp;D) departments.
* Market-focus driven organisation often have design responsibility in their marketing departments.
* Brand-focus driven organisations often have design responsibility in corporate communication.

Depending on the strategic orientation, design management overlaps with other management branches to differing extents:

[[Marketing management]]: The concepts and elements of brand management overlap with those of design management. In practice, design management can be part of the job profile of a marketing manager, though the discipline includes aspects that are not in the domain of marketing management. This intersection is called "brand design management" and consists of positioning, personality, purpose, personnel, project and practice,&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee_note" group="note" /&gt; where the objective is to increase brand equity.&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee" /&gt;

[[Operations management]]: At the operational level design management deals with the management of design projects. Processes and tools from operations management can be applied to design management in the execution of design projects.

[[Strategic management]]: Due to the increasing importance of design as a differentiator and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with strategic design issues and supports the strategic direction of the business or enterprise. The debate on design thinking suggests the integration of design thinking into strategic management. Design thinking and strategic thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, [[adductive]], hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, [[dialectic]]al, enquiring and value-driven.&lt;ref name="Wit-Meyer2004" /&gt;

[[Innovation management]]: The value of the coordinating role of design in [[new product development]] has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.&lt;ref name="Mozota2003" /&gt;

===Hierarchy===
Like the management of strategy, design can be managed on three levels: strategic (corporate level or enterprise wide), tactical (business level or individual business units), and operational (individual project level). These three levels have been termed differently by various authors over the last 50 years.

Operational design management involves the management of individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic design management. Success of good design management can be measured by evaluating the quality of operational design management outcomes.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.

'''Tactical level'''

Tactical design management addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes. Its goal is to create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic design management and the implementation of design on the operational level.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related to the creation of a structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design &amp; innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.

'''Strategic level'''

[[Strategic design]] management involves the creation of strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic design management is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating a relationship between the design and corporate strategy.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for the development and implementation of a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: [[design strategy|design strategist]], strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.

===Role and responsibility===
Design management is not a standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different [[industries]] and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different [[target group]]s and markets to serve. Design management is multifaceted, and so are the different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal1996vol9" /&gt;

'''Task'''

Similar tasks can be grouped into categories to describe the job profile of a design manager. Different categories in management that encompass design were defined by several authors; those tasks occur on all three design management levels (strategic, tactical, and operational):

'''Authority and position'''

The authority and position of the design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does in his or her daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function:&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a "line function" is directly responsible for design execution in the "primary" organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the "primary" organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited authority and the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a "secondary" organisational process, design management is seen as "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R&amp;D, and communication.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; Various authors use different concepts to describe the authority and position of design management; they can be grouped as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ style="padding-bottom:1em" | Terms used to describe categories of position and authority of design management

==Design Policy (since the 2010s)==
Today, most developed countries have some kind of design promotion programme. The Design Management Institute has dedicated three issues to design policy development.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt; Although initiatives promote design in different complexities, scopes and focuses, specific targets tend to address the following objectives:&lt;ref name="Sotamaa2004" /&gt;
* support business: increase use of design by companies, particularly by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and grow the design sector (use dimension);
* promote to the public: increase exports of design and attract international investment (international dimension);
* educate designers: improve design education and research (academic dimension).

A very comprehensive analysis on the situation of design on national level in Britain is the Cox review. The chairman of the [[Design Council]], Sir George Cox, published the Cox Review of Creativity in Business&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G (2005) Cox Review of Creativity in Business: Building on the
UK’s strengths. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407171211/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/coxreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 to communicate the competitive advantage of design for the British industry.

Innovation policies have been excessively focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years.&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kootstra2009" /&gt; However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation.&lt;ref name="APCI2004" group="note" /&gt; Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU innovation policy.

==Education (since the 2000s)==
[[File:London Business School facade.jpg|thumb|Design management was first taught at the London Business School, in 1976.]]
While design management had its origins in business schools, it has increasingly become embedded in the curriculum in design schools, particularly at the postgraduate level. Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the [[London Business School]] in 1976,&lt;ref name="LBSleaflet1989" /&gt; and the first programme of design management at a design school was started in the 1980s at the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA), DeMontfort, Middlesex, Staffordshire. Although, in the UK, some design management courses have not been sustainable, including those at the RCA, Westminster and Middlesex, other postgraduate courses have flourished including ones at Brunel, [http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/postgraduate-courses/design-management-ma/ Lancaster] and more recently the University of the Arts with each providing a specific point of view on design management.

The Design Leadership Fellowship at the [[University of Oxford]] was founded in 2005. In the same year the Stanford University Institute of Design founded the D-school, a faculty intended to advance multidisciplinary innovation. The Finnish [[Aalto University]] was founded in 2010 and is a merger of the three established Finnish universities – the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (HSE), University of Art and Design Helsinki (TaiK), and University of Technology (TKK) – that had been cooperating on the IDBM design management program since 1995. Since 2006 the [[Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts]] in Switzerland offers one of the few undergraduate studies in design management, completely taught in English.

''[[BusinessWeek]]'' annually publishes a lists of the best programmes that combine design thinking and business thinking (''D-schools 2009''&lt;ref name="Businessweek_2009_d-school" /&gt; and ''D-school Programmes to Watch 2009''&lt;ref name="Businessweek_2009_d-school_watch" /&gt;). The article ''Finland – World´s Innovation Hot Spot'' in the Harvard Business Review shows the interest of business leaders in the blended education of design and management.&lt;ref name="Havard2011" /&gt; Business Schools (such as the Rotman School of Management, Wharton University of Pennsylvania and MIT Sloan Executive Education) have acted on this interest and developed new academic curricula.

Integrated education models are emerging in the academic world, a model which is referred to as T-shape and π-shaped education.&lt;ref name="Karjalainen" /&gt; T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from ''small T'' innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to ''big T'' innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group="note"|refs=
&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009"&gt;The highest awareness in the design management community got the Pro Inno Europe initiative (the EU's "focal point for innovation policy analysis, learning and development"), because it funded the ADMIRE (Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises) project. The goal of the project was to stimulate companies to invest in design management and use it as a key driver for innovation and competitiveness (e.g. through the Design Management Award, the DME library and the DME self-assessment tool).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="APCI2004"&gt;In 2004, a representative of the EU{{who|date=November 2018}} intimated that there will never be a design policy at European level pursued by the EU, until the national policies become more effective and consistent across Europe (January 2004, on the APCI conference in Paris)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5note"&gt;With the award [...] London Transport's position as the first great commercial organisation to think of design as a major factor involving all its activities has at last been formally recognised.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee_note"&gt;The elements of design management are: purpose, personnel, Presence, Project and Practice. The elements of brand management are identity, positioning, personality, system and equity. The elements of brand design management are positioning, personality (personality and presence), purpose (identity and purpose), personnel, project and practice, with the objective to increase brand equity.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture_note"&gt;There are 5.885 million workers across the EU in the cultural and creative sector, this are 3.1% of the total employment in the EU. Those workers generate revenue of 654 billion EUR, which is 2.6% of the EU gross value added. The creative industry is on the 3rd place among the economic sectors of the EU and the international trade in creative goods and services experienced an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent between 2000 and 2005. (see below: EU-Study "The economy of culture in Europe", 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="wicked_problem"&gt;"Wicked problem" is a phrase originally used in social planning to describe a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Fayol1841-1925"&gt;[[Henri Fayol]] (1841–1925) considers management to consist of six [[function (engineering)|functions]]: forecasting, planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. He was one of the most influential contributors to modern concepts of management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8036">[[Image:Lesser Ury Dame im Kaffee.jpg|thumb|''Woman in Cafe'', drypoint by [[Lesser Ury]] showing the typical rich blurred line of drypoint.]] 
'''Drypoint''' is a [[printmaking]] technique of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, in which an image is incised into a plate (or "matrix") with a hard-pointed "needle" of sharp metal or diamond point. In principle the method is practically identical to [[engraving]]. The difference is in the use of tools, and that the raised ridge along the furrow is not scraped or filed away as in engraving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catrais.org/catraisorg/Glossary.html Glossary of Printmaking Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the plate was [[copper]], but now [[cellulose acetate|acetate]], [[zinc]], or [[plexiglas]] are also commonly used.  Like [[etching]], drypoint is easier to master than [[engraving]] for an artist trained in drawing because the technique of using the needle is closer to using a pencil than the [[Burin (engraving)|engraver's burin]].

The term is also used for inkless scratched inscriptions, such as glosses in manuscripts.

==Lines and burrs==
[[Image:Mary Cassatt - The Bath.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''The Bath'', drypoint combined with [[aquatint]], 1890-1.]]
The lines produced by printing a drypoint are formed by the [[Burr (metal)|burr]] thrown up at the edge of the incised lines, in addition to the depressions formed in the surface of the plate.  A larger burr, formed by a steep angle of the tool, will hold a lot of ink, producing a characteristically soft, dense line that differentiates drypoint from other intaglio methods such as [[etching]] or [[engraving]] which produce a smooth, hard-edged line. The size or characteristics of the burr usually depend not on how much pressure is applied, but on the angle of the needle. A perpendicular angle will leave little to no burr, while the smaller the angle gets to either side, the larger the burr pileup. The deepest drypoint lines leave enough burr on either side of them that they prevent the paper from pushing down into the center of the stroke, creating a feathery black line with a fine, white center. A lighter line may have no burr at all, creating a very fine line in the final print by holding very little ink.  This technique is different from [[engraving]], in which the incisions are made by removing metal to form depressions in the plate surface which hold ink, although the two methods can easily be combined, as [[Rembrandt]] often did.  Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for comparatively small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions with burr can be made, and after the burr has gone, the comparatively shallow lines will wear out relatively quickly.  Most impressions of Rembrandt prints on which drypoint was used show no burr, and often the drypoint lines are very weak, leaving the etched portions still strong.  To counter this and allow for longer print runs, [[electroplating]] (called steelfacing by printmakers) can harden the surface of a plate and allow the same edition size as produced by etchings and engravings.

==History== 
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Portrait of Artist's Wife, drypoint, ca 1905, 11.5x7.7 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Stanisław Masłowski]], ca 1905, ''Portrait of Artist's Wife'', drypoint, 11.5x7.7 cm, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]]]]
The technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German 15th-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the [[old master print]] [[Albrecht Dürer]] produced 3 drypoints before abandoning the technique; [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]] used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with [[etching]] and [[engraving]]. As [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques, they can all be used on the same plate. [[Alex Katz]] used this process to create several of his famous works, such as  "Sunny" and "The Swimmer".

In the 20th century many artists produced drypoints, including [[Max Beckmann]], [[Milton Avery]], and [[Hermann-Paul]]. By adding [[aquatint]] work on the plate and inking with various colours, artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]] have produced colour drypoints. Canadian artist [[David Brown Milne]] is credited as the first to produce coloured drypoints by  the use of multiple plates, one for each colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005307 thecanadianencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the West Coast of the United States the respected printmaker [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] simplified the methods for producing drypoints in art schools.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=66-67, 91 notes 353-354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of needles==
Any sharp object can theoretically be used to make a drypoint, as long as it can be used to carve lines into metal.  Dentistry tools, nails, and metal files can all be used to produce drypoints.  However, certain types of needles are created specifically for drypoints:
*'''Diamond-tipped needles''' carve easily through any metal and never need sharpening, but they are expensive.
*'''Carbide-tipped steel needles''' can also be used to great effect, and are cheaper than diamond-tipped needles, but they need frequent sharpening to maintain a sharp point. Steel needles were traditionally used.

==Printing processes==
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909, Two Nude Figures (Deux figures nues), steel-faced drypoint on Arches laid paper, 13 x 11 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909, ''Two Nude Figures'' (''Deux figures nues''), steel-faced drypoint on Arches laid paper, 13 x 11 cm, printed by Delâtre, Paris, published by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]]]
Printing is essentially the same as for the other intaglio techniques, but extra care is taken to preserve the burr. After the image is finished, or at least ready to proof, the artist applies ink to the plate with a dauber.  Too much pressure will flatten the burrs and ruin the image.  Once the plate is completely covered with a thin layer, a [[tarlatan]] cloth is used to wipe away excess ink, and paper (typically pages from old phone books) may be used for a final wipe of the lightest areas of the image.  Some printmakers will use their bare hand instead to wipe these areas.  Once the desired amount of ink is removed, the plate is run through an [[etching press]] along with a piece of dampened paper to produce a print.  

===Hand-wiping techniques===
Drypoint wiping techniques vary slightly from other intaglio techniques.  Less pressure is applied to achieve desirable lines, because the burrs forming the image are more fragile than etched or engraved lines, but also because the ink rests on the plate surface, instead of pressed down into indentations.  Also, because of the characteristics of the way the burrs catch ink, the direction of the wiping matters.  Ink tends to pile up in the lee of the burr during the application of the ink and wiping with the tarlatan, so if the printer wipes in the direction of the lines with his hand, he may remove most of the ink, leaving a light gray line.  However, if he wipes perpendicularly to the line, he can actually increase the pile of ink on the other side of the line, darkening the printed line.

==Reviews==
Jennifer Egan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gilbert's prose as "fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible", but said that the book "drags" in the middle. She was more interested in "the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out", noting that Gilbert omits the "confusion and unfinished business of real life", and that "we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] enjoyed the book, and devoted two episodes of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to it.&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

Maureen Callahan of the ''[[New York Post]]'' heavily criticized the book, calling it "[[narcissistic]] [[New Age]] reading", and "the worst in [[Orientalism|Western fetishization]] of Eastern thought and culture, assured in its answers to existential dilemmas that have confounded intellects greater than hers." In addition, she was critical of Oprah's focus on the book, as well as Oprah's fans who enjoy the book, asking why her fans are "indulging in this silliness", and why they aren't "clamoring for more weight when it comes to Oprah's female authors".&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

[[Katie Roiphe]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' agreed with Egan about the strength of Gilbert's writing. However, she described the journey as too fake: "too willed, too self-conscious". She stated that given the apparent artificiality of the journey, her "affection for ''Eat, Pray, Love'' is ... furtive", but that "it is a transcendently great beach book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2007/07/summer_reading.html |title=Summer Reading: Should you read the best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love? |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Roiphe |first=Katie |date=July 3, 2007 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s Grace Lichtenstein stated that "The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie."&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt;

Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', however, praised the spiritual aspect of the book, stating that "To read about her struggles with a 182-verse Sanskrit chant, or her (successful) attempt to meditate while being feasted on by mosquitoes, is to come about as close as you can to enlightenment-by-proxy." He did, however, agree with Roiphe that her writing occasionally seems to be "trying too hard to be liked; one feels the belabored mechanism of her jokes".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1161222,00.html |title=The Year of Living Happily |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Grossman |first=Lev |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Leibovich of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] agreed with several other reviewers about the strength of Gilbert's story telling.

In early 2010, the feminist magazine ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' published a critical review and social commentary called "Eat, Pray, Spend". Authors Joshunda Sanders and Diana Barnes-Brown wrote that "''Eat, Pray, Love'' is not the first book of its kind, but it is a perfect example of the genre of priv-lit: literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, [[existential]], or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women's hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial." The genre, they argued, positions women as inherently and deeply flawed, and offers "no real solutions for the astronomically high tariffs—both financial and social—that exclude all but the most fortunate among us from participating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/article/eat-pray-spend "Eat, Pray, Spend"]. ''BitchMagazine.com''. Retrieved June 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody==

[[Andrew Gottlieb]], an American comedy writer and producer, wrote a parody of Gilbert's Book, titled ''Drink, Play, Fuck: One Man's Search for Anything Across Ireland, Vegas and Thailand''. Gottlieb, in a 2010 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', said, "I was mystified by the success of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' and I felt that the book, and its Oprah-sanctioned ubiquity, needed to be made fun of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/08/the-exchange-andrew-gottlieb.html "The Exchange: Andrew Gottlibe"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2289">The '''Embroiderers' Guild of America''', headquartered in [[Louisville, Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;"The light is better in Louisville" was the winning pitch in 1989, when the location for a new national headquarters, formerly in New York, was being decided.&lt;/ref&gt; is an organization dedicated to "fostering the art of [[needlework]] and associated arts." Its members practice any and all forms of needlework, and are dedicated to [[education]] and [[community outreach]]. EGA has chapters throughout the [[United States]]. Chapters are organized into regions. Events are organized at all levels of the organization.

Membership in EGA is open to anyone interested in embroidery from the beginner to the professional. Members work within local chapters or a member-at-large network to improve their skills and knowledge. Also, the organization and individual members are involved with museums for education and preservation purposes. EGA offers individual and group correspondence courses, teacher and judge certification programs as well as master craftsman programs.

The Guild's definition of embroidery is intentionally unconfining: anything made "using a needle with an eye in it". In 2006 The national guild has 9,000 members organized in 295 local chapters in 13 regions.

The Guild was established in [[New York City|New York]] in 1958 as a branch of The [[Embroiderers' Guild (United Kingdom)|Embroiderers' Guild of London]] (established in 1906) but withdrew in 1970.

The organization's head office in Louisville includes a gallery for displays from its permanent collection and changing exhibits of embroidery.

The '''Emmanuel Gallery''' is an [[art gallery]] and historic building at 1205 10th Street in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], United States, on the [[Auraria Campus]].

The gallery is housed in Denver's oldest surviving church building and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Emmanuel Shearith Israel Chapel'''. It was built in 1876 as an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal church]], on the site of a Sunday School building that was erected in 1859. In 1903, it was bought by the Shearith Israel congregation and converted to serve as a [[Jewish synagogue]], which it was until 1958.&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=69000041}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Emmanuel Shearith Israel Chapel / Emmanuel Episcopal Chapel |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=1 July 2016 |author=Robert Fink |date=October 23, 1969 }} with {{NRHP url|id=69000041|photos=y|title=Two photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration of [[melanin]] in the [[iris pigment epithelium]] (located on the back of the iris), the melanin content within the iris stroma (located at the front of the iris), and the cellular density of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huiqiong Wang, Stephen Lin, Xiaopei Liu, Sing Bing Kang |title=Separating Reflections in Human Iris Images for Illumination Estimation |journal=Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision |volume=2 |pages=1691–1698 |year=2005 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.87.418 | doi=10.1109/ICCV.2005.215 |isbn=0-7695-2334-X|last2=Lin|last3=Xiaopei Liu |last4=Sing Bing Kang }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of blue and green, as well as hazel eyes, results from the [[Tyndall effect|Tyndall scattering]] of light in the stroma, a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky called [[Rayleigh scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturm R.A. &amp; Larsson M., Genetics of human iris colour and patterns, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res, 22:544-562, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid.&lt;ref name="Fox1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Clyde W. |title=Blue Eyes |journal= Journal of Physical Chemistry | volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=498–501 |year=1924 | doi=10.1021/j150239a007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye color is thus an instance of [[structural color]] and varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-colored eyes.

The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments, such as [[pteridine]]s, [[purine]]s, and [[carotenoid]]s.&lt;ref name="Oliphant 1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliphant LW |title=Pteridines and purines as major pigments of the avian iris |journal=Pigment Cell Res. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=129–31 |year=1987 |pmid=3507666 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.1987.tb00401.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other animals have many [[phenotypic]] variations in eye color.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, PJ.

These changes are known as [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s or SNPs. The actual number of genes that contribute to eye color is currently unknown, but there are a few likely candidates. A study in [[Rotterdam]] (2009) found that it was possible to predict eye color with more than 90% accuracy for brown and blue using just six SNPs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126992.100-dna-test-for-eye-colour-could-help-fight-crime.html "DNA test for eye colour could help fight crime"], ''[[New Scientist]]'' 14 March 2009.

The gene ''OCA2'' ({{OMIM3|203200}}), when in a variant form, causes the pink eye color and [[hypopigmentation]] common in human [[albinism]]. (The name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes, oculocutaneous albinism type II.) Different SNPs within ''OCA2'' are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in [[freckling]], [[Mole (skin marking)|mole]] counts, [[hair color|hair]] and [[Human skin color|skin tone]]. The polymorphisms may be in an ''OCA2'' [[regulatory sequence]], where they may influence the expression of the gene product, which in turn affects pigmentation.&lt;ref name="OCA2" /&gt; A specific mutation within the ''HERC2'' gene, a gene that regulates ''OCA2'' expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes.&lt;ref name="Kayser"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Three genome-wide association studies and a linkage analysis identify HERC2 as a human iris color gene |journal=Am.

Blue eyes with a brown spot, green eyes, and gray eyes are caused by an entirely different part of the genome.

==Ancient DNA and eye color in Europe==
People of European descent show the greatest variety in eye color of any population worldwide. Recent advances in [[ancient DNA]] technology have revealed some of the history of eye color in Europe. All European [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherer remains so far investigated have shown genetic markers for light-colored eyes, in the case of western and central European hunter-gatherers combined with dark skin color. The later additions to the European [[gene pool]], the Early [[Neolithic]] farmers from [[Anatolia]] and the [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Copper Age]]/[[Bronze Age]] pastoralists (possibly the [[Proto-Indo-European]] population) from the area north of the [[Black Sea]] appear to have had much higher incidences of dark eye color alleles, and alleles giving rise to lighter skin, than the original European population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Haak | first1 =W. | last2 = Lazaridis | first2 = I. | last3 = Patterson | first3 = N. | last4 = Rohland | first4 = N. | last5 = Mallick | first5 = S. | last6 = Llamas | first6 = B. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = G. | last8 = Nordenfelt | first8 = S. | last9 = Harney | first9 = E. | last10 = Stewardson | first10 = K. | last11 = Fu | first11 = Q. | last12 = Mittnik | first12 = A. | last13 = Bánffy | first13 = E. | last14 = Economou | first14 = C. | last15 = Francken | first15 = M. | last16 = Friederich | first16 = S. | last17 = Pena | first17 = R.

==Classification of color==
Iris color can provide a large amount of information about a person, and a classification of colors may be useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to ocular pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite journal |author=German EJ, Hurst MA, Wood D, Gilchrist J |title=A novel system for the objective classification of iris colour and its correlation with response to 1% tropicamide |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=103–10 |year=1998|pmid=9692029 |doi=10.1016/S0275-5408(97)00070-7|last2=Hurst |last3=Wood |last4=Gilchrist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification systems have ranged from a basic light or dark description to detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison.&lt;ref name=German/&gt; Others have attempted to set objective standards of color comparison.&lt;ref name=Fan&gt;Fan S, Dyer CR, Hubbard L. [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~shaohua/research/iris/IrisColor_files/IrisTr1495.pdf Quantification and Correction of Iris Color."] Technical report 1495, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dec 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye colors range from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest tints of blue.&lt;ref name=Sturm/&gt; To meet the need for standardized classification, at once simple yet detailed enough for research purposes, Seddon et al. developed a graded system based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or yellow pigment present.&lt;ref name=Seddon&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of an iris color classification system |journal=[[Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science]] |last=Seddon |first=J.M. |author2=CR Sahagian, RJ Glynn, RD Sperduto and ES Gragoudas |volume=31 |pages=1592–8 |publisher=Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology |date=1 August 1990|url=http://www.iovs.org/content/31/8/1592.abstract |accessdate=19 October 2011 |pmid=2201662 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three pigment colors that determine, depending on their proportion, the outward appearance of the iris, along with [[structural color]]. Green irises, for example, have blue and some yellow. Brown irises contain mostly brown. Some eyes have a dark ring around the iris, called a [[limbal ring]].

Eye color in non-human animals is regulated differently. For example, instead of blue as in humans, [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive]] eye color in the skink species ''[[Corucia zebrata]]'' is black, and the autosomal [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] color is yellow-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones, S.L. |author2=Schnirel, B.L. |title=Subspecies comparison of the Genus: Corucia |journal=Polyphemos |year=2006 |volume=4 |pages=1–25 |url=http://www.biology-online.org/biology-forum/about7587.html |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202023446/http://www.biology-online.org/biology-forum/about7587.html |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

As the [[color vision|perception of color]] depends on viewing conditions (e.g., the amount and kind of illumination, as well as the hue of the surrounding environment), so does the perception of eye color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edromanguitars.com/tech/color.htm Color Perception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020182804/http://www.edromanguitars.com/tech/color.htm |date=20 October 2006 }}.

==Changes in eye color==
[[File:Light eye coloration map.png|thumb|Percentage of light eyes in and near Europe according to anthropologist Robert Frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html|title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors?|website=cogweb.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most new-born babies who have European ancestry have light-colored eyes. As the child develops, melanocytes (cells found within the iris of human eyes, as well as skin and hair follicles) slowly begin to produce [[melanin]]. Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment, in theory eye color can be changed. Adult eye color is usually established between 3 and 6 months of age, though this can be later.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, A. and Leifer, G. (2001) ''Maternity Nursing: An Introductory Text'', W.B. Saunders Medical, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no reflection from the back of the iris, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of melanin. An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the infant ages. An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to turn from blue to green or brown as the infant ages.

Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during early childhood, puberty, pregnancy, and sometimes after serious trauma (like [[heterochromia]]) do represent cause for a plausible argument stating that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.

Studies on Caucasian twins, both fraternal and identical, have shown that eye color over time can be subject to change, and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined. Most eye-color changes have been observed or reported in the Caucasian population with hazel and amber eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9152135|title=Eye Color Changes Past Early Childhood|year=1997|last1=Bito|first1=LZ|last2=Matheny|first2=A|last3=Cruickshanks|first3=KJ|last4=Nondahl|first4=DM|last5=Carino|first5=OB|volume=115|issue=5|pages=659–63|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|doi=10.1001/archopht.1997.01100150661017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eye color chart (Martin scale)==
[[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]] created a chart by the original [[Martin scale]]. The numbering is reversed on the scale below in the (later) [[Martin–Schultz scale]], which is (still) used in [[physical anthropology]].

'''Light and light-mixed eyes''' (16–12 in Martin scale)

Pure light (16–15 in Martin scale)
* 16: pure light blue
* 15: gray

Light-mixed (14–12 in Martin scale)
* 14: Very light-mixed (blue with gray or green or green with gray)
* 13-12: Light-mixed (light or very light-mixed with small admixture of brown)

'''Mixed eyes''' (11–7 in Martin scale) 
Mixture of light eyes (blue, gray or green) with brown when light and brown appearance is at the same level.

'''Dark and dark-mixed eyes''' (6–1 in Martin scale)
* Dark-mixed: 6–5 in Martin scale. Brown with small admixture of light
* Dark: 4–1 in Martin scale. Brown (light brown and dark brown) and very dark brown (almost black)

===Amber===
[[File:EyesAmber1.JPG|thumb|Amber eyes in sunlight – displaying an orange color rather than brown]]
Amber eyes are of a solid color and have a strong yellowish/golden and russet/coppery tint. This may be due to the deposition of the yellow pigment called [[lipochrome]] in the iris (which is also found in green eyes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhmi.org/cgi-bin/askascientist/highlight.pl?kw=&amp;file=answers%2Fgenetics%2Fans_044.html Howard Hughes Medical Institute: Ask A Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901150309/http://www.hhmi.org/cgi-bin/askascientist/highlight.pl?kw=&amp;file=answers%2Fgenetics%2Fans_044.html |date=1 September 2010 }}.

Eyecarecontacts.com. Retrieved on 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Amber eyes should not be confused with hazel eyes; although hazel eyes may contain specks of amber or gold, they usually tend to comprise many other colors, including green, brown and orange. Also, hazel eyes may appear to shift in color and consist of flecks and ripples, while amber eyes are of a solid gold hue. Even though amber is considered to be like gold, some people have russet or copper colored amber eyes that many people mistake for hazel, though hazel tends to be duller and contains green with red/gold flecks, as mentioned above. Amber eyes may also contain amounts of very light gold-ish gray.

The eyes of some pigeons contain yellow fluorescing pigments known as [[pteridine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliphant LW |title=Observations on the pigmentation of the pigeon iris |journal=Pigment Cell Res. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=202–8 |year=1987 |pmid=3508278 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.1987.tb00414.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bright yellow eyes of the [[great horned owl]] are thought to be due to the presence of the pteridine pigment [[xanthopterin]] within certain [[chromatophore]]s (called xanthophores) located in the iris stroma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliphant LW |title=Crystalline pteridines in the stromal pigment cells of the iris of the great horned owl |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=217 |issue=2 |pages=387–95 |year=1981 |pmid=7237534 |doi=10.1007/BF00233588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, yellowish specks or patches are thought to be due to the pigment [[lipofuscin]], also known as lipochrome.&lt;ref name=Lefohn/&gt; Many animals such as canines, domestic cats, owls, eagles, pigeons and fish have amber eyes as a common color, whereas in humans this color occurs less frequently.

===Blue===
{{redirect|Blue eyes}}
[[File:BrightBlueEyes.JPG|thumb|A light blue iris]]

There is no blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the ocular fluid. Dissection reveals that the iris pigment [[epithelium]] is brownish black due to the presence of [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Menon&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menon IA, Basu PK, Persad S, Avaria M, Felix CC, Kalyanaraman B |title=Is there any difference in the photobiological properties of melanins isolated from human blue and brown eyes? |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=549–52 |year=1987|pmid=2820463 |pmc=1041224 |doi=10.1136/bjo.71.7.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike brown eyes, blue eyes have low concentrations of [[melanin]] in the stroma of the iris, which lies in front of the dark epithelium. Longer wavelengths of light tend to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium, while shorter wavelengths are reflected and undergo [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; This is the same frequency-dependence of scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky.&lt;ref name="Fox1978"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt; The result is a "[[Tyndall effect|Tyndall]] blue" [[structural color]] that varies with external lighting conditions.

In humans, the inheritance pattern followed by blue eyes is considered similar to that of a [[recessive]] trait (in general, eye color inheritance is considered a [[polygenic trait]], meaning that it is controlled by the interactions of several genes, not just one).&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; In 2008, new research tracked down a single genetic mutation that leads to blue eyes. "Originally, we all had brown eyes," said Eiberg.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeanna|last=Bryner|title= Genetic mutation makes those brown eyes blue|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=19 October 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22934464/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiberg and colleagues suggested in a study published in ''Human Genetics'' that a mutation in the 86th [[intron]] of the ''[[HERC2]]'' gene, which is hypothesized to interact with the ''OCA2'' gene [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], reduced expression of ''OCA2'' with subsequent reduction in melanin production.&lt;ref name="blue mutation"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Blue eye color in humans may be caused by a perfectly associated founder mutation in a regulatory element located within the HERC2 gene inhibiting OCA2 expression |journal=Hum.

[[File:Blue_eyed_black_lemur_face_by_Bruce_McAdam.jpg|thumb|[[Sclater's lemur]], also known as the blue-eyed black lemur]] 
Blue eyes are rare in mammals; one example is the recently discovered marsupial, the [[blue-eyed spotted cuscus]] (''Spilocuscus wilsoni''). The trait is hitherto known only from a single [[primate]] other than humans – [[Sclater's lemur]] (''Eulemur flavifrons'') of Madagascar. While some [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s have blue eyes, this is usually due to another mutation that is [[Deaf white cat|associated with deafness]]. But in cats alone, there are four identified gene mutations that produce blue eyes, some of which are associated with [[congenital]] [[neurological disorder]]s.  The mutation found in the [[Siamese cat]]s is associated with strabismus (crossed eyes).  The mutation found in blue-eyed solid white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for "epistatic white") is linked with deafness.  However, there are phenotypically identical, but genotypically different, blue-eyed white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for white spotting) where the coat color is not strongly associated with deafness.  In the blue-eyed [[Ojos Azules]] breed, there may be other neurological defects.  Blue-eyed non-white cats of unknown genotype also occur at random in the cat population.

===Gray===
[[File:Gray eyes.jpg|thumb|Gray eyes]]

Like blue eyes, gray eyes have a dark epithelium at the back of the iris and a relatively clear stroma at the front. One possible explanation for the difference in the appearance of gray and blue eyes is that gray eyes have larger deposits of [[collagen]] in the stroma, so that the light that is reflected from the epithelium undergoes [[Mie scattering]] (which is not strongly frequency-dependent) rather than Rayleigh scattering (in which shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more). This would be analogous to the change in the color of the sky, from the blue given by the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by small gas molecules when the sky is clear, to the gray caused by Mie scattering of large water droplets when the sky is cloudy.&lt;ref name="Southworth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=232 |title=Are gray eyes the same as blue in terms of genetics? |work=Understanding Genetics: Human Health and the Genome |publisher=Stanford School of Medicine |author=Lucy Southworth |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085904/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=232 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been suggested that gray and blue eyes might differ in the concentration of melanin at the front of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Southworth" /&gt;

As with blue eyes, the color of green eyes does not result simply from the pigmentation of the iris.  The green color is caused by the combination of: 1) an amber or light brown pigmentation in the stroma of the iris (which has a low or moderate concentration of melanin) with: 2) a blue shade created by the Rayleigh scattering of reflected light.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; Green eyes contain the yellowish pigment [[lipochrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allaboutgenes.weebly.com/oca2.html OCA2: The Gene for Color]. allaboutgenes.weebly.com.

Instead, the copper accumulates in the liver and in other tissues, including the iris of the eye. This results in the formation of [[Kayser–Fleischer ring]]s, which are dark rings that encircle the periphery of the iris.&lt;ref name=McDonnell&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonnell G, Esmonde T |title=A homesick student |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=75 |issue=884 |pages=375–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10435182|pmc=1741256|last2=Esmonde | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.75.884.375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aniridia===
{{Main|Aniridia}}
[[Aniridia]] is a congenital condition characterized by an extremely underdeveloped iris, which appears absent on superficial examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|oph|43|Aniridia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocular albinism and eye color===
Normally, there is a thick layer of melanin on the back of the iris. Even people with the lightest blue eyes, with no melanin on the front of the iris at all, have dark brown coloration on the back of it, to prevent light from scattering around inside the eye. In those with milder forms of [[albinism]], the color of the iris is typically blue but can vary from blue to brown. In severe forms of albinism, there is no pigment on the back of the iris, and light from inside the eye can pass through the iris to the front. In these cases, the only color seen is the red from the hemoglobin of the blood in the capillaries of the iris. Such albinos have pink eyes, as do albino rabbits, mice, or any other animal with a total lack of melanin. [[Transillumination]] defects can almost always be observed during an [[eye examination]] due to lack of iridial pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|OPH|260|Ocular Manifestations of Albinism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocular albino also lacks normal amounts of melanin in the retina as well, which allows more light than normal to reflect off the retina and out of the eye. Because of this, the [[Pupillary light reflex|pupillary reflex]] is much more pronounced in albino individuals, and this can emphasize the [[red eye effect]] in photographs.

===Heterochromia===
{{Main|Heterochromia iridum}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Heterochromia.jpg|thumb|An example of complete heterochromia. The subject has one brown eye and one hazel eye.]]
[[File:HeterochromiaEye.jpg|thumb|left|An example of sectoral heterochromia. The subject has a blue iris with a brown section.]]

Heterochromia (''[[heterochromia iridum]]'' or ''heterochromia iridis'') is an eye condition in which one iris is a different color from the other (complete heterochromia), or where a part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia). It is a result of the relative excess or lack of [[pigment]] within an iris or part of an iris, which may be [[Biological inheritance|inherited]] or acquired by [[disease]] or [[injury]].&lt;ref name=Imesch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Imesch PD, Wallow IH, Albert DM |title=The color of the human eye: a review of morphologic correlates and of some conditions that affect iridial pigmentation |journal=Surv Ophthalmol |volume=41 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S117–23 |year=1997 |pmid=9154287 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(97)80018-5 |last2=Wallow |last3=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncommon condition usually results due to uneven [[melanin]] content. A number of causes are responsible, including genetic, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], [[Horner's syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].

A [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]] can have two different colored eyes just like any two siblings can—because each cell has different eye color genes. A [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] can have two different colored eyes if the DNA difference happens to be in an eye-color gene.

There are many other possible reasons for having two different-colored eyes.  For example, the film actor [[Lee Van Cleef]] was born with one blue eye and one green eye, a trait that reportedly was common in his family, suggesting that it was a genetic trait.  This anomaly, which film producers thought would be disturbing to film audiences, was "corrected" by having Van Cleef wear brown contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1812|section=bio|Lee Van Cleef}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Bowie]], on the other hand, had the appearance of different eye colors due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.

Another hypothesis about heterochromia is that it can result from a viral infection ''in utero'' affecting the development of one eye, possibly through some sort of genetic mutation.  Occasionally, heterochromia can be a sign of a serious medical condition.

A common cause in females with heterochromia is [[X-inactivation]], which can result in a number of heterochromatic traits, such as [[calico cats]]. Trauma and certain medications, such as some [[prostaglandin analogue]]s, can also cause increased pigmentation in one eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hejkal TW, Camras CB |title=Prostaglandin analogs in the treatment of glaucoma |journal=Seminars in ophthalmology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=114–23 |year=1999 |pmid=10790575 |doi=10.3109/08820539909061464 |last2=Camras}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, a difference in eye color is caused by blood staining the iris after injury.

==Mate selection and traits that have been linked to iris color==

===Selection for rare iris colors===
A study compared the frequency of eye color in commercial advertising models in Brazil and the UK, these countries were chosen because they have inverted frequencies of eye-coloration, with Brazil having an excess of brown and the UK an excess of light-colored eyes. Models are chosen for their attractiveness, and it was found that, in Brazil, models with light eyes are in a significant excess compared to the levels found in the general population, while, in the UK, models with brown or intermediate eyes were in significant excess over their frequency in the general population. This suggests that eye color rarity plays a role in sexual attraction, people with rare eye colors being perceived as being more attractive. Some research indicates that eye color variation is greater in women than in men, which may reflect [[sexual selection]] of mates with rare eye colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0168458| pmid=28005995| pmc=5179042|title = Human Commercial Models' Eye Colour Shows Negative Frequency-Dependent Selection| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=11| issue=12| pages=e0168458|year = 2016|last1 = Forti|first1 = Isabela Rodrigues Nogueira| last2=Young| first2=Robert John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection though imprinting of parental eye color===
In contrast to the phenomenon of selection for rarity, scholarship has implied the existence another form of eye color involvement in mate selection. A study found a significant incidence of the partners of heterosexual people possessing similar eye and hair color to that of their opposite-sex parent. This is suggestive of a form of parental imprinting on eventual mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;Little A.C., Penton-Voak I.S., Burt D.M., Perrett D.I. (2003)''Investigating an imprinting like phenomenon in humans: partners and opposite-sex parents have similar hair and eye colour'', Evol Hum Behav., 24(1):43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">'''Fairy tale parody''' is a [[genre]] of fiction which parodies traditional [[fairy tale]]s. 

The genre was popularized on television by the ''[[Fractured Fairy Tales]]'' segments on ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Kinsella/&gt;&lt;!--1959 to 1961?--&gt;

The 2001 [[computer-animated]] film ''[[Shrek]]'' brought great popularity to the genre. Parodies soon eclipsed traditional fairy tales. The genre garnered some praise for its more modern views but was also criticized for supplanting the traditional stories.&lt;ref name=Poniewozik/&gt;

Children's books that have been classified as fairy tale parodies:
* ''The Giant's Big Toe'' by [[Brock Cole]]
* ''Sleeping Ugly'' by [[Jane Yolen]]
* ''Jack and the Meanstalk'' by [[Brian Wildsmith]] and Rebecca Wildsmith
* ''The Book That Jack Wrote'', ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'', ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince, Continued]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]]
* ''Ruby'', by Michael Emberley
* ''Jim Henson Presents Goldilocks, Miss Piggy's Dream'' by Louise Gikow
* ''The Three Bears'' by Cindy West
* Cinderella

* ''The Adventures of Simple Simon'' by Chris Conover
* ''The Velveteen Killer Rabbit'' by Elia Anie 
* ''Kawoni's Journey Across the Mountain: A Cherokee Little Red Riding Hood'' by Cordellya Smith

''Politically Correct Fairy Tales'' and ''[[Politically Correct Bedtime Stories |Politically Correct Bedtime Stories: Modern tales for our life and times]]'' by [[James Finn Garner]] have been called "Adult fractured fairy tales&amp;nbsp;... still humorous but the humor is for adults".&lt;ref name=kinsella2/&gt;

[[File:François Cellier by Ellis and Walery.jpg|thumb|Cellier, by [[Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg#Photographic career|Ellis and Walery]], c.1890]]

'''François Arsène Cellier''' (14 December 1849&amp;ndash;5 January 1914), often called '''Frank''', was an English conductor and composer. He is known for his tenure as musical director and conductor of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the original runs and early revivals of the [[Savoy opera]]s.

Succeeding his elder brother [[Alfred Cellier|Alfred]] as the company's chief conductor in 1878, Cellier devoted almost all the rest of his life to [[comic opera]]. He was musical director for the original runs of nine [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas and fourteen full-length pieces by other writers at the [[Savoy Theatre]] between 1881 and 1902. He composed songs and also some short [[curtain raisers]] that were well received but have rarely been revived.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Cellier was born in [[South Hackney]], London, the youngest of the five children of Arsène Cellier, a language teacher from France, and his wife Mary Ann Peterine, formerly Peacock, ''né'' Thomsett.&lt;ref name=ancestry&gt;[https://search.ancestryinstitution.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=allgs&amp;gss=sfs28_ms_f-2_s&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Francois%20Arsene&amp;gsfn_x=1&amp;gsln=Cellier&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;MSAV=0&amp;uidh=aqs François Cellier"], Ancestry Institution, [[Wellcome Library]], accessed 20 January 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed his eldest brother [[Alfred Cellier|Alfred]] as a chorister at the [[Chapel Royal#St_James's_Palace|Chapel Royal, St James's]]. Like his brother and the latter's fellow pupil [[Arthur Sullivan]], François benefited from the tutelage of the Rev [[Thomas Helmore]], who ensured that the choristers received an all-round education in addition to their musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the choir school at the age of seventeen, Cellier held a series of posts as an organist, first in Belfast, Ireland, and then at the church of St John of Jerusalem, South Hackney, where he had been christened, and in 1870 St Michael's, [[Sydenham|Lower Sydenham]].&lt;ref name=era&gt;"Popular Composers: Mr. François Cellier", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 12 August 1899, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; After a spell as Sullivan's deputy organist at St Peter's, Cranley Gardens, [[South Kensington]], he moved to St Anne's, [[Surbiton]], where he remained for the rest of his career, in tandem with his theatrical conducting work.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

Cellier married Clara Short in 1873. They had five daughters and a son, François, who became an actor under the name of [[Frank Cellier (actor)|Frank Cellier]] and was the father of the actor [[Peter Cellier]].&lt;ref name=ancestry/&gt;

===Conductor and musical director===
In July 1878 Cellier succeeded his brother Alfred as the conductor of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' during its long run at the [[Opera Comique]], London. He remained as the company's musical director there and, from 1881, at the [[Savoy Theatre]], until 1902, with a break between July 1880 and April 1881, when his brother temporarily resumed the position.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The composer conducted at first nights, but Cellier, as musical director, was the principal conductor for the original runs of ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881&amp;ndash;82), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882&amp;ndash;84), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885&amp;ndash;87), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888&amp;ndash;89), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889&amp;ndash;91), ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893&amp;ndash;94) and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 8&amp;ndash;15&lt;/ref&gt; As the Savoy's musical director he conducted the London runs of fourteen operas by other authors or composers between 1891 and 1902,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 13&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; fourteen revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan works, beginning with ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1884 and ending with ''Iolanthe'' in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 9&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar number of curtain-raisers and afterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed musical-director-in-chief at [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]] for the runs of Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' and [[André Messager|Messager's]] ''[[La Basoche]]'' in 1891&amp;ndash;92.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

In the 1890s Cellier began conducting [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] productions outside London. In 1890 he took charge of the first provincial performances of ''The Gondoliers'',&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1894 he conducted a touring company presenting ''Princess Ida'' and ''Utopia, Limited''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902&amp;ndash;03 he led a D'Oyly Carte tour of South Africa, conducting six Gilbert and Sullivan operas and ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly left D'Oyly Carte on his return to England in June 1903. During that month he conducted a one-off matinée performance of his new operetta, ''Bob'' (libretto by the author and journalist Cunningham Bridgeman) at the [[Adelphi Theatre]]. The piece had been premiered in [[Walsall]] in April while he was still in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bob'' was also played by D'Oyly Carte touring companies in 1903&amp;ndash;04.&lt;ref name=bob&gt;Walters, Michael, and George Low. [http://www.gsarchive.net/companions/bob/index.html "Bob"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 1996, accessed 20 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1904 Cellier conducted a short-lived comic opera, ''Ladyland'', by Eustace Ponsonby and Frank Lambert at the [[Playhouse Theatre|Avenue Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1905 he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte company, until retiring in 1913, as musical director of the touring repertory company and, at the Savoy, conducting the London repertory seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas in 1906&amp;ndash;07 and 1908&amp;ndash;09.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 21, 22, 121–125 and Appendix p. I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composer, orchestrator and author===
[[File:Old Sarah.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Part of a programme showing Cellier's ''[[Old Sarah]]'' preceding a revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], 1897]]
In addition to ''Bob'', which never played at the Savoy Theatre, Cellier composed music for several [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] that played together with the Savoy Operas (and often also on tour), including ''[[Mrs. Jarramie's Genie]]'' (1888, composed jointly with his brother Alfred, libretto by [[Frank Desprez]]), ''[[Captain Billy]]'' (1891, libretto by [[Harry Greenbank]]), ''[[Old Sarah]]'' (1897, libretto by Greenbank), and ''[[Pretty Polly (opera)|Pretty Polly]]'' (1900, libretto by [[Basil Hood]]).&lt;ref name=bob/&gt; These short pieces have rarely been revived professionally, but they were popular with amateur groups in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;.

For the ''Children's [[H.M.S. Pinafore|Pinafore]]'' in 1879&amp;ndash;80 and the ''Children's [[The Pirates of Penzance|Pirates]]'' in 1884, Cellier transposed the song keys to fit each individual child's voice. The choruses, especially the string parts, were rearranged so that the children's voices could be heard, and orchestral accompaniment was provided for the normally unaccompanied numbers for the support of the young male voices.&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' commented that although his other commitments left him short of time for composition, as a song-writer Cellier was "very favourably known".&lt;ref name=era/&gt; His published songs in the catalogue of the [[British Library]] are: "From Dawn to Dawn" (words by R. J. Martin, 1898); "Sad 'tis to Part" (words by W. S. Beadle, 1889); "The Polo Song" (words by "Marksman", 1901); "No Fear!" (words by R. J. Martin, 1903); and four songs with words by Bridgeman: "Coquet and Coy" (1887); "Hampton Courtship" (1887); "'Tis For the Best" (1888); and "Men of the Day" (1888). His short [[anthem]], "Holy, Holy, Holy" was published in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?ct=facet&amp;fctN=facet_rtype&amp;fctV=Scores&amp;rfnGrp=1&amp;rfnGrpCounter=1&amp;frbg=&amp;&amp;vl(488279563UI0)=any&amp;fn=search&amp;indx=1&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&amp;tb=t&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;mode=Basic&amp;ct=search&amp;srt=rank&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dum=true&amp;vl(freeText0)=Francois%20Cellier&amp;dstmp=1516461264878 "François Cellier"], British Library, accessed 20 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellier devoted his brief retirement to writing a book of reminiscences about Gilbert, Sullivan and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (''Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas''). He died at his home in [[Kingston upon Thames]] in 1914 before the book was completed, and his collaborator, Bridgeman, completed and published it later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[Henry Lytton]] wrote:
{{quote|Cellier had his heart and soul in every performance, and what that means is known only to those who work on the stage, and who do sometimes become dull and listless because of their very familiarity with the parts they are playing or because the audience cannot easily be aroused to 'concert pitch'. ... It is at just such times as these that a real conductor is worth his weight in gold. Notwithstanding that he may have seen the piece hundreds of times &amp;ndash; and might with reason be more bored than the principals themselves &amp;ndash; he comes to each new performance with an enthusiasm which shakes the company out of themselves and makes everything go with a will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/lytton_secrets/ch7.html Lytton, Henry. ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922)]&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Cellier's collaborator Bridgeman wrote of his friend's dedication to the music of Arthur Sullivan and Alfred Cellier, to the exclusion, Bridgeman felt, of all other music. Sullivan willed to Cellier the original manuscript scores for ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Mr François Cellier", ''The Times'', 7 January 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Bridgeman, and the anonymous author of ''The Era's'' profile, considered, as Lytton did, that Cellier's natural talent could have equipped him to rival the creative success of at least one of his two musical idols, but that indolence and lack of ambition prevented it.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridgeman in Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Both those sources agree that Cellier's conducting technique was unshowy and strictly practical, and he took pleasure in being known as "the musician who conducts in English".&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

A '''hookah lounge''' (also called a '''shisha bar''' or '''den''', especially in Britain and parts of Canada, or a '''hookah bar''') is an establishment where patrons share [[Mu‘assel|shisha]]  from a communal [[hookah]] or from one which is placed at each table or a bar. [[File:HarvardSquareHookah.jpg|222px|thumb|Center|A [[hookah]] and a variety of [[tobacco]] products are on display in a [[Harvard Square]] [[window shopping|store window]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]].]]
Often, hookah lounges are owned and operated by people from the [[Arab world]],  origin and or other regions where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition. Many hookah lounges incorporate such elements as [[Islamic architecture|Islamic decor]] and [[Arabic music]] or [[Music of India|Indian music]]. In Europe this is no longer a fact and hookah lounges are simply a bar without the eastern cultural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/20/EBGAJCNHUM1.DTL&amp;type=t|title=East Bay: Aromas, relaxation are the hook in hookah|date=20 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Hookah lounges are mostly found in [[college town]]s and [[urban area]]s and are regarded by some as a novel and chic way to socialize and embrace [[multiculturalism]]. Certain lounges offer modern hookahs with fruit bowls or other kinds of improvements over smoking hookah at home.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192828/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/344847/hookah_bars_finding_a_place_in_america/index.html?source=r_health|title=Hookah Bars Finding a Place in America - Health - RedOrbit|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people of [[Middle East]]ern or [[South Asia]]n extraction consider them a continuation of their own cultural traditions. Hookah lounges nowadays often distance themselves from the eastern cultures offering hookah and alcohol without the cultural elements. These bars differ from other bars only in the fact that they offer hookah. {{CN|date=June 2015}}

Typically a disposable mouthpiece is provided for each user for [[hygiene]] reasons.  Hookah lounges do not typically have [[liquor license]]s but instead derive the bulk of their revenue from sales of [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s and [[snack food]]s.{{cn|date=August 2014}}  Almost all offer [[Turkish coffee]]. 

Some hookah lounges have well-equipped kitchens and are more akin to [[bistro]]s.  In the broadest sense, any [[restaurant]] or [[nightclub]] can be considered a hookah lounge if it offers patrons hookahs, shisha and a comfortable place to smoke. Some offer [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] menu items.

Due to several state anti-tobacco laws, many hookah bars have made the transition from smoking traditional shisha to smoking herbal shisha because it contains no tobacco, or nicotine and is legal indoors in areas specific to the prohibition of tobacco smoking. Herbs do produce tar when they burn.

The hookah in its first and simplest form originated in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article-niche.com/launch/25-08-2008History-Of-Hookah.htm|title=article-niche.com|website=article-niche.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon traveled west to [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]], where it gained mass popularity{{CN|date=June 2015}} The hookah lounge has clear antecedents in the tradition of [[coffee house]]s in the Middle East and Turkey, where people smoke tobacco from hookahs or other styles of [[Bong|water pipe]] provided by the establishment.  In this traditional setting the hookah is typically of the single-hose variety.  This is in contrast with the multi-hose variety favored in the hookah lounge and intended to emphasize the communal nature of the activity.

==In Europe==
*'''[[Germany]]''' - Hookahs are available in many establishments in Germany, particularly in [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]] and the [[Ruhr Area]] and areas, and it is not only popular amongst [[Turkish people]].
*'''[[Netherlands]]''' - Hookahs are now gaining popularity in the Netherlands, particularly in [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]].
*'''[[United Kingdom]]''' - In the United Kingdom, hookahs are most commonly found in "shisha bars" run by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] or [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] people. Since a 2007 British ban on smoking in public places, Shisha bars have risen from 179 in 2007 to 556 in 2012. Birmingham also has a large number of Shisha lounges also such as Shabbi Shics in the Digbeth area of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hubble, bubble |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2013/08/24/hubble-bubble |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=The Economist |date=24 August 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Spain]]''' - Hookah use has grown in popularity in Spain, especially among the young.  As a result, many ''teterías'' ([[tea house]]s) have made hookahs available to patrons.
* '''[[Russia]]''' - Due to heavy influence from Caucasus and Central Asia, hookahs have become a widespread recreational practice in large Russian cities, and are now offered in many cafes and restaurants.
* '''[[Denmark]]''' - Hookah lounges have gained heavy popularity in the recent years. You can most likely find a hookah lounge in every moderately big city. [[Aarhus]], [[Odense]] and [[Copenhagen]] being the biggest citites in Denmark, you can without a doubt find several hookah lounges in each of these cities.

==In the United States==
[[Image:Hookah Lounge.jpg|thumb|Mist Hookah Lounge in North Brunswick, New Jersey]]
In the [[United States]], establishments akin to hookah lounges first opened decades ago in the [[immigrant]] quarters of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California]] as coffee and tea houses. The Hookah was not the central focus of the businesses until the Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas featured it as the primary offering. Patrons were typically men of Middle Eastern descent{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The first establishment to call itself the Hookah Lounge, is in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Hookah Lounge created the entire experience of the Hookah, specialty cocktails and Middle Eastern food. The decor is Moroccan. They registered the name in 2000 and began using the URL Hookahlounge.com. They have two locations in Las Vegas. It was the first full service bar that focused its business around serving hookahs. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas was opened in 2000 by owner Paymon Raouf and operator Jeff Ecker. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas originally defended the use of the name Hookah Lounge but it became too commonly used and too costly to defend. They now use the term America's Original Hookah Lounge in advertisements to better identify them as the first to operate in a major lounge setting. 

Many hookah lounges in the United States have [[modernism|modernistic]] elements such as glass tables, [[plasma television]]s, and [[oxygen bar]]s. Most bars in the U.S. require patrons to be at least 18 years of age to smoke shisha and 18 years of age to purchase (exceptions are Utah, Arizona, Alabama, and New Jersey: 19 years of age to smoke; New York is 21 years of age). &lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;

One purveyor of hookahs and shisha claims:

{{quote|It's at its largest demand ever in this country...I don't think it's going away anytime soon. There's so much more room for the product to expand. Only a small percentage of Americans know about it.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;}}

Over the recent years hookah in general has become increasingly popular for the young-adults; those who are just at the legal age to smoke in their state. It is not uncommon now to find hookah bars within short distance of college campuses and in the surrounding towns. This younger generation has revitalized the hookah market, hookah bars are successful and remaining open despite indoor smoking bans{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} For private hookah smokers, many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets now offer hookah products for sale.

==Smoking bans and exemptions==
Hookah use has increased dramatically among American and European youth in recent years because of the social atmosphere it creates, and because many young adults know it as an alternative to cigarette smoking.

Many municipalities, especially in North America and Europe have enacted [[smoking ban]]s in public places. Sometimes, however, businesses can obtain special permits allowing smoking within; these permits are typically available only for hookah lounges, [[cigar bar]]s, [[tobacconist]]s, and similar establishments where smoking is the focus of activity. They are less frequently available for places in which alcohol or food is served.

In some cases, the ban is against tobacco smoking specifically. When this is the case, a hookah lounge may remain in business by replacing traditional, tobacco-based shisha with a tobacco-free Mu‘assel.

In order to remain open, many hookah lounges cannot sell food or beverages. Approximately 90% of the cities that have put a ban on smoking in public places have exemptions for hookah lounges. The cities with these kinds of exemptions, typically, have more dense populations.&lt;ref name="PublicBan"&gt;A, Primack B. "US Health Policy Related to Hookah Tobacco Smoking." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 24 July 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health concerns===
Because hookah lounges are exempt from the smoking bans, and because the hookah trend is increasing at a high rate among youth, many believe it is becoming a public health concern. Many hookah users do not understand the health risks that come along with it. Common beliefs include shisha is not addictive, and the smoke contains less [[carcinogens]].
Hookah smoke contains the same chemicals found in cigarettes, it is not safer because it is smoked as often, it is addictive, and even if the tobacco is filtered with water, the carcinogens are not filtered out.&lt;ref name="HealthEffects"&gt;Morris, Daniel S., Steven C. Fiala, and Rebecca Pawlak. "Opportunities for Policy Interventions to Reduce Youth Hookah Smoking in the United States." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. N.p., 15 Nov. 2012. Web. 01 Apr. 2013..&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Popularity"&gt;Channick, Robert. "Hookah Lounges Thriving, Three Years after Smoking Ban." Chicago Tribune. N.p. Web.13 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many cities want to create tougher restrictions for hookah lounges, and some want them shut down altogether.

The '''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' ('''ICESCR''') is a multilateral [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 16 December 1966 through GA. Resolution 2200A (XXI), and came in force from 3 January 1976.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt; It commits its parties to work toward the granting of [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] (ESCR) to the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]] and individuals, including [[labour rights]] and the [[right to health]], the [[right to education]], and the [[right to an adequate standard of living]]. As of September 2018, the Covenant has 169 parties.&lt;ref name="reservations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-3&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=UN Treaty Collection: International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|last=|first=|date=3 January 1976|website=|publisher=UN|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further four countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.

The ICESCR (and its [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|Optional Protocol]]) is part of the [[International Bill of Human Rights]], along with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), including the latter's [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|first]] and [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|second]] Optional Protocols.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |title=Fact Sheet No.2 (Rev.1), The International Bill of Human Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=June 1996 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313093428/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |archivedate = 13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Covenant is monitored by the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on economic, social and cultural rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CESCR/Pages/CESCRIndex.aspx|work=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
The ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bill of human rights|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|work=lawteacher.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140819165643/http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man" had been proposed at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 San Francisco Conference]] which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] was given the task of drafting it.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt; Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt;

Drafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of [[negative right|negative]] civil and political versus [[positive right|positive]] economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Human Rights|last=Sieghart |first=Paul |year=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, "one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights."&lt;ref name=unga-r543&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 543, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously.&lt;ref name=unga-r543/&gt; Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 545, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]], shall promote the realization of the right of [[self-determination]], and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;'''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''', Part I, Article 1, Paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document became the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the [[UN General Assembly]] for discussion in 1954, and adopted in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2200, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR, with a preamble and thirty-one articles, divided into five parts.&lt;ref&gt;The following section summarises the text of the Covenant.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 1''' (Article 1) recognises the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]], including the right to "freely determine their political status",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a [[negative right]] of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence,&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 2''' (Articles 2–5) establishes the principle of "progressive realisation" – see below. It also requires the rights be recognised "without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The rights can only be limited by law, in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights, and only for the purpose of "promoting the general welfare in a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 3''' (Articles 6–15) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to
* work, under "just and favourable conditions",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; with the right to form and join trade unions (Articles 6, 7, and 8);
* [[social security]], including [[social insurance]] (Article 9);
* family life, including paid [[parental leave]] and the protection of children (Article 10);
* [[right to an adequate standard of living|an adequate standard of living]], including adequate [[right to food|food]], clothing and [[right to housing|housing]], and the "continuous improvement of living conditions" (Article 11);
* health, specifically "the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health" (Article 12);
* [[right to education|education]], including free universal primary education, generally available secondary education and equally accessible higher education. This should be directed to "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society (Articles 13 and 14);
* participation in cultural life (Article 15).

Many of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them.

'''Part 4''' (Articles 16–25) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It also allows the monitoring body – originally the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] – now the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the [[UN General Assembly]] on appropriate measures to realise the rights (Article 21)

'''Part 5''' (Articles 26–31) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.

==Core provisions==

===Principle of progressive realisation===
'''Article 2''' of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to

&lt;blockquote&gt;take steps... to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is known as the principle of "progressive realisation". It acknowledges that some of the rights (for example, the right to health) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time, and that states may be subject to resource constraints, but requires them to act as best they can within their means.

The principle differs from that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to "respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction" the rights in that Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICCPR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |pages=Article 2.1 |publisher=UN |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to "take steps" imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, {{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(symbol)/CESCR+General+comment+3.En?OpenDocument |title=CESCR General Comment 3 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=14 December 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 10.&lt;/ref&gt; If resources are highly constrained, this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraphs 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour rights===
{{main|Labour rights}}
'''Article&amp;nbsp;6''' of the Covenant recognises the [[right to work]], defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties are required to take "appropriate steps" to safeguard this right, including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately [[full employment]]. The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment. They must prevent [[workplace discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]] and ensure access for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/493bee38093458c0c12571140029367c/$FILE/G0640313.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 18: The Right to Work |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=6 February 2006|pages=paragraph 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit [[Unfree labour|forced]] or [[child labor]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work referred to in Article&amp;nbsp;6 must be ''[[decent work]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This is effectively defined by '''Article&amp;nbsp;7''' of the Covenant, which recognises the right of everyone to "just and favourable" working conditions. These are in turn defined as fair wages with [[equal pay for equal work]], sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants; [[Occupational safety and health|safe working conditions]]; equal opportunity in the workplace; and sufficient rest and leisure, including limited [[working hours]] and regular, [[paid holidays]].

'''Article&amp;nbsp;8''' recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the [[right to strike]]. It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico]]), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as [[firefighter]]s (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of Japan|Japan]]).&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

===Right to social security===
{{main|Social security}}
'''Article 9''' of the Covenant recognizes "the right of everyone to [[social security]], including [[social insurance]]".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; and to ensure that families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|title=CESCR Draft General Comment 19: The right to social security|accessdate=13 July 2008|publisher=UN Economic and Social Council|date=4 February 2008|at=paragraphs 1 – 4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520002906/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and non-contributory schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right, with very low levels of access.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several parties, including France and Monaco, have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions, provided they are proportionate and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to family life===
{{main|Children's rights|Fathers' rights|Mothers' rights|Reproductive rights}}
'''Article 10''' of the Covenant recognises the family as "the natural and fundamental group unit of society", and requires parties to accord it "the widest possible protection and assistance".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not [[forced marriage|forced]].&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |title=Fact Sheet No.16 (Rev.1), The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=July 1991 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501050654/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |archivedate = 1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must also provide [[parental leave|paid leave]] or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth, an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9. Finally, parties must take "special measures" to protect children from economic or social exploitation, including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to an adequate standard of living===
{{main|Right to food|Right to water|Right to housing|Right to clothing}}
'''Article 11''' recognises the [[right to an adequate standard of living|right of everyone to an adequate standard of living]]. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and "the continuous improvement of living conditions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 11.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate [[world hunger]].

The '''right to adequate food''', also referred to as the [[right to food]], is interpreted as requiring "the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3d02758c707031d58025677f003b73b9?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 12: The right to adequate food |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 May 1999|pages=paragraph 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 12'', paragraph 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world [[food supply|food supplies]] in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;''''ICESCR, Article 11, 2 (b)&lt;/ref&gt; The right to adequate food also implies a [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=4538838d11&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;advsearch=y&amp;amp;process=y&amp;amp;allwords=comment%2015&amp;amp;exactphrase=&amp;amp;atleastone=&amp;amp;without=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;monthfrom=01&amp;amp;yearfrom=2003&amp;amp;monthto=01&amp;amp;yearto=2003&amp;amp;coa=&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;citation=|title=CESCR General Comment 15: The right to water |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=20 January 2003|pages=paragraph 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate housing''', also referred to as the [[right to housing]], is "the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/469f4d91a9378221c12563ed0053547e?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 4: The right to adequate housing |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=13 December 1991|at= paragraph 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires "adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7/&gt; Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as "the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/959f71e476284596802564c3005d8d50?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 7: The right to adequate housing: forced evictions |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=20 May 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate clothing''', also referred to as the [[right to clothing]], has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion. What is considered "adequate" has only been discussed in specific contexts, such as refugees, the disabled, the elderly, or workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Stephen James, [http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf ''"A Forgotten Right?

===Right to health===
{{main|Right to health}}
'''Article 12''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 12.1&lt;/ref&gt; "Health" is understood not just as a right to be healthy, but as a right to control one's own health and body (including reproduction), and be free from interference such as [[torture]] or medical experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/40d009901358b0e2c1256915005090be?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=11 August 2000|pages=paragraph 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, sanitation, food, nutrition and housing, and through a comprehensive system of healthcare, which is available to everyone without discrimination, and economically accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraphs 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 12.2''' requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens, including reducing infant mortality and improving child health, improving environmental and workplace health, preventing, controlling and treating epidemic diseases, and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all. These are considered to be "illustrative, non-exhaustive examples", rather than a complete statement of parties' obligations.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women's' [[reproductive rights]], by not limiting access to [[contraception]] or "censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting" information about sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ Human Rights and the Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306185240/http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ |date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to free education===
{{main|Right to education}}
'''Article 13''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to [[free education]] (free for the [[primary education|primary]] level and "the progressive introduction of free education" for the [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher levels]]). This is to be directed towards "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its [[dignity]]",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1/&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society. Education is seen both as a human right and as "an indispensable means of realizing other human rights", and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/ae1a0b126d068e868025683c003c8b3b?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 13: The right to education |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=8 December 1999|pages=paragraph 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 13.2''' lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of [[Right to education|free, universal and compulsory]] primary education, "generally available and accessible" secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop a school system (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; "[p]rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all"; secondary education "shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of [[free education]]"; and "[h]igher education shall be made [[universal access to education|equally accessible to all]], on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education".

'''Articles 13.3 and 13.4''' require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children, also referred to as [[freedom of education]]. It also recognises the right of parents to "ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.3&lt;/ref&gt; This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non-discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the [[academic freedom]] of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers [[corporal punishment]] in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 14''' of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free [[compulsory education|compulsory]] primary education, to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction "within a reasonable number of years".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to participation in cultural life===
{{main|Right to science and culture}}
{{main|Right to development}}
{{main|Right to public participation}}
'''Article 15''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life, enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created. The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property, but the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of authors and "proclaim[ing] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/03902145edbbe797c125711500584ea8/$FILE/G0640060.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 17: The right of everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 January 2006|at= paragraph 12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work. The material rights are interpreted as being part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and "need not extend over the entire lifespan of an author."&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 17'', paragraph 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties must also work to promote the conservation, development and diffusion of science and culture, "respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage international contacts and cooperation in these fields.

==Reservations==
A number of parties have made [[reservation (law)|reservations]] and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant.

'''Algeria''' interprets parts of Article 13, protecting the liberty of parents to freely choose or establish suitable educational institutions, so as not to "impair its right freely to organize its educational system."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Bangladesh''' interprets the self-determination clause in Article 1 as applying in the historical context of [[colonialism]]. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within the context of its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Belgium''' interprets non-discrimination as to national origin as "not necessarily implying an obligation on States automatically to guarantee to foreigners the same rights as to their nationals. The term should be understood to refer to the elimination of any arbitrary behaviour but not of differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations, in conformity with the principles prevailing in democratic societies."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''China''' restricts labour rights in Article 8 in a manner consistent with its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Egypt''' accepts the Covenant only to the extent it does not conflict with Islamic [[Sharia]] law. Sharia is "a primary source of legislation" under Article 2 of both the suspended [[s:Constitution of Egypt|1973 Constitution]] and the [[s:2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt|2011 Provisional Constitutional Declaration]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''France''' views the Covenant as subservient to the [[UN Charter]]. It also reserves the right to govern the access of aliens to employment, social security, and other benefits.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''India''' interprets the right of self-determination as applying "only to the peoples under foreign domination"&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and not to apply to peoples within sovereign nation-states. It also interprets the limitation of rights clause and the rights of equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Indonesia''' interprets the self-determination clause (Article 1) within the context of other international law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation-state.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Ireland''' reserves the right to promote the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Japan''' reserved the right not to be bound to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education, the right to strike for [[civil service|public servant]] and the remuneration on public holidays.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Kuwait''' interprets the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its constitution and laws, and reserves the right to social security to apply only to Kuwaitis. It also reserves the right to forbid strikes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Mexico''' restricts the labour rights in Article 8 within the context of its constitution and laws.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Monaco''' interprets the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of national origin as "not necessarily implying an automatic obligation on the part of States to guarantee foreigners the same rights as their nationals",&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and reserves the right to set residence requirements on the rights to work, health, education, and social security.

'''New Zealand''' reserved the right not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were incompatible with it.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Norway''' reserves the right to strike so as to allow for compulsory arbitration of some labour disputes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Pakistan''' has a general reservation to interpret the Covenant within the framework of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Thailand''' interprets the right to self-determination within the framework of other international law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Trinidad and Tobago''' reserves the right to restrict the right to strike of those engaged in essential occupations.

'''Turkey''' will implement the Covenant subject to the UN Charter. It also reserves the right to interpret and implement the right of parents to choose and establish educational institutions in a manner compatible with its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United Kingdom''' views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter. It made several reservations regarding its overseas territories.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United States''' – [[Amnesty International]] writes that "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The '''[[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]''' is a side-agreement to the Covenant which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing a historic gap in human rights |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D39BD9ED5406650FC125751C0039FE08?opendocument |publisher=United Nations |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Economic, social and cultural rights: legal entitlements rather than charity" say UN Human Rights Experts |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/C5486C42747EC60BC125751B005B08B3?opendocument |publisher=United Nations |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32207&amp;Cr=cultural+rights&amp;Cr1= |title=UN urges States to adhere to new instrument to protect human rights |publisher=United Nations |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013 has been signed by 40 parties and ratified by 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-3-a&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having passed the threshold of required ratifications it has entered into force on 5 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12968&amp;LangID=E DisplayNews].

==Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights==
{{main|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

The '''Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/ECOSOC/resolutions/E-RES-1985-17.doc |title=ECOSOC Resolution 1985/17 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=28 May 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other human rights monitoring bodies, the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees. Rather, it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16/&gt;

All states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant. The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant; thereafter reports are due every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/index.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations".

The Committee typically meets every May and November in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – Sessions |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611184428/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19293">[[File:Julian-Sturgis.jpg|thumb|right|Sturgis circa 1890]]
'''Julian Russell Sturgis''' (21 October 1848 – 13 April 1904) was a novelist, poet, librettist and lyricist. Born in the US, he lived and worked in Britain nearly all his life and took British citizenship.

Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], Sturgis was a notable athlete. He distinguished himself in Eton's sporting activities and rowed for Balliol for three years. He then played [[association football]] as an amateur, from 1872 to 1876, and was the first foreigner to play in an [[FA Cup Final]].

Sturgis qualified as a [[barrister]], but he embarked on a writing career in 1874, producing novels, poetry, plays and [[libretto|libretti]].  He wrote the words for four operas, with music by [[Arthur Goring Thomas]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], respectively. He is, perhaps, best remembered as the librettist for Sullivan's 1891 opera ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:1896 FA Cup.jpg|thumb|right|125px|The Wanderers' trophy from the [[1873 FA Cup Final]]]]  
Sturgis was born in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the fourth son of merchant and lawyer [[Russell Sturgis (1805–1887)|Russell Sturgis]] and his third wife, Julia Overing ''née'' Boit  (1820–1888). His great-grandfather was another [[Russell Sturgis (1750-1826)|Russell Sturgis]], and his older half-brother was [[John Hubbard Sturgis]].&lt;ref&gt;Boit, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; When Julian was seven months old, the family moved to England, where Russell Sturgis joined [[Baring Brothers]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kellscraft.com/captainsboston/captainsboston03.html "Russell Sturgis" biography], ''Some Merchants and See Captains of Old Boston'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Sturgis's obituary in  ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that his half brother was the art critic [[Russell Sturgis]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/04/14/100468284.pdf "Julian Sturgis Dead"].

Sturgis was granted British nationality in 1877, and he travelled extensively throughout the world in the late 1870s.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

===Writer===
Sturgis's first published work as a professional writer was a short piece, "The Philosopher's Baby", in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1874.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His first novel was ''John-a-Dreams'' (1878), followed the next year by ''An Accomplished Gentleman'', of which ''[[The Times]]'' said:

{{quote|It may be described as an Idyll of Anglo-Italian life under the sunny skies of Venetia. Mr. Sturgis, who must have steeped himself in local inspiration, dwells with delicately sympathetic discrimination on his scenes as well as his characters. ... But with all its poetical refinement of tone and inspirations of cultivation and art worship there is a great deal of fun in the book in one shape or another.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Novels", ''The Times'', 7 July 1879, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Sturgis's biographer Elizabeth Lee writes that he specialised in "light comedies, mostly set at Eton or Oxford."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1880 he published ''Little Comedies'', described by Lee as "dialogues in dramatic form containing some of his most dazzling and characteristic writing".&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1882 two books by Sturgis came out: ''Comedies New and Old'' and ''Dick's Wandering''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In November 1883, he married Mary Maud de la Poer Beresford. They had three sons.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; One, [[Mark Beresford Russell Grant-Sturgis|Mark]], would later become assistant [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin F. Seedorf, "[[Mark Beresford Russell Grant-Sturgis|Sturgis, Sir Mark Beresford Russell Grant-]]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nadeshda.jpg|thumb|left|Playbill of ''Nadeshda'', 1885]]
In 1885, Sturgis wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Arthur Goring Thomas]]'s opera, ''Nadeshda'', which was first performed at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on 16 April 1885. In a generally favourable review, the critic in ''The Times'' noted that Sturgis had taken the plot from an old Russian story recently adapted as a German novel, and commented, "Wherever or in what shape Mr. Sturgis may have found his materials he has treated them in a clever and workmanlike manner. His diction is not very refined or elevated, and his metre in rhymed lyrics or blank verse often defies the rules of prosody. But the incidents of the story are set forth simply and clearly, and more than one powerful situation is attained."&lt;ref&gt;"Nadeshda", ''The Times'', 17 April 1885, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgis continued to write novels during the 1880s.  They were ''My Friends and I'' (1884), ''John Maidment'' (1885), ''Thraldom'' (1887), and ''The Comedy of a Country House'' (1889). Reviewing the second of these, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' said, "Readers of ''Little Comedies'' know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself that it is only a few people who know him to be a scoundrel at all.  He has made a fresh and more audacious study of this type in ''John Maidment'', a study audacious but successful."&lt;ref&gt;"New Books", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 23 January 1886, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgis's father died in 1887, leaving substantial legacies to his children.{{#tag:ref|The ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' incorrectly gives the year as 1883. Russell Sturgis's death was noted in the press in November 1887.&lt;ref&gt;"Money-Market and City Intelligence", ''The Times'' 7 November 1887, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wills/&gt;|group= n}} Sturgis received £40,000 tax-free,&lt;ref name=wills&gt;"Recent Wills", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 29 December 1887, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; the equivalent of more than £20m in 2010 terms.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Samuel H.

===1890s and last years===
[[File:Ivanhoe-programme.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Programme for ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', 1891]]
Throughout the 1880s, [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]] chafed at the restrictions of the comic operas for which he was famous.  His friends and associates, and even the queen, encouraged him to write a serious opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 188, 267 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  His usual collaborator, [[W.S. Gilbert]], declined to join him in writing a full-scale romantic opera, and recommended Sturgis as "the best serious librettist of the day".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1891), is an adaptation of [[Walter Scott]]'s long patriotic novel [[Ivanhoe|of the same title]]. Most critics praised the libretto. [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] was an exception, accusing Sturgis of "wanton debasement of a literary masterpiece", turning "Scott's noble dialogue" into "[[fustian]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|It is unclear how "noble" Shaw really held Scott to be: writing five years later he said, "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard.

The only novel published by Sturgis in the 1890s was ''The Folly of Pen Harrington'' (1897).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also essayed a sustained piece of verse in ''Count Julian: a Spanish Tragedy'' (1893), which he followed with ''A Book of Song'' (1894).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Among his poems, three were set to music by [[Hubert Parry]], an old friend from Eton days:&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, Jeremy.

[[File:Goringthomas-sullivan-mackenzie-stanford.jpg|thumb|left|Sturgis's operatic collaborators: clockwise from top l. [[Arthur Goring Thomas]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]]]
In 1901, Sturgis wrote the libretto for [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s opera, "''Much Ado About Nothing''", based on the [[Much Ado About Nothing|play]] by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Sturgis's text was exceptionally faithful to Shakespeare's original.&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Opera", ''The Times'', 31 May 1901, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' commented, "Not even in the ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' of [[Arrigo Boito]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]] have the characteristic charm, the ripe and pungent individuality of the original comedy been more sedulously preserved."&lt;ref&gt;"Much Ado About Nothing", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 31 May 1901, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The libretto for Stanford was the last of the four that Sturgis wrote. He did not live to see the third of them staged. In 1899 he wrote a libretto for [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] based on, and with the same title as, [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]'s story ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]''.&lt;ref name=chandler&gt;Chandler, David. [http://www.dickens.jp/archive/general/g-chandler.pdf "Beef and Pie, Fairies and Failure: The First English Dickens Opera"], Dickens Fellowship of Japan, accessed 7 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The text was published in 1901, and Mackenzie set it shortly afterwards. Accounts vary as to why it was not produced at the time.  It may have been because the composer and the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] could not agree on terms,&lt;ref name=chandler/&gt; or because another adaptation by [[Karl Goldmark]] had been successfully presented too recently for another version to be viable.&lt;ref name=cricket&gt;Barrett, Francis F. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/907772 "The Cricket on the Hearth: Sir A. C. Mackenzie's Opera"], ''The Musical Times'' , Vol. 55, No. 857 (July 1914), p. 460 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece did not reach the stage until ten years after Sturgis's death.  It was given under the composer's baton by students of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1914, with future stars of different operatic genres in the cast: [[Darrell Fancourt]] and [[Eva Turner]].&lt;ref name=cricket/&gt; The critic from ''[[The Musical Times]]'' wrote of Sturgis's "skill and sympathy. ... He approached his task in the true Dickens spirit and made a good version of the story, strengthening it ... by lyrics of appropriate spirit and refinement."&lt;ref name=cricket/&gt;

Sturgis died at his London house in [[Knightsbridge]] on 13 April 1904, aged 55, after a long illness.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sturgis was cremated and his ashes were buried in Compton Cemetery, near his country house in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  [[Henry James]] wrote to Sturgis's widow of her husband's "beautiful, noble, stainless memory, without the shadow upon him, or the shadow of a shadow, of a single grossness or meanness or ugliness – the world's dust on the nature of thousands of men. Everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him, and when I think of my friendship of so many years with him I see it all as fairness and felicity."&lt;ref&gt;James, Henry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6443">The '''Limburg Staurotheke''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], stauros “[[cross]]” and theke “[[container]]”) is an example of a [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[reliquary]]. It was crafted sometime in the mid to late 10th century in [[Constantinople]]. The box measures 48 centimeters by 35 centimeters and has a depth of 6 centimeters. This reliquary design was common in Byzantium beginning in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Holger A.|title=Eastern Objects and Western Desires: Relics and Reliquaries between Byzantium and the West|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|date=2004|volume=58|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limburg Staurotheke is currently housed in [[Germany]] in the Limburg an der Lahn.

== Description and History ==
[[File:Intérieur de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Limburg Staurotheke with the True Cross reliquary in place.]]
The Limburg Staurotheke consists of two parts that were made at separate times. The removable, double-armed cross was made first and holds seven fragments of the [[True Cross]] in the middle of the cross where its main set of arms meets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hostetler|first1=Bradley A.|title=The Limburg Staurotheke: A Reassessment|journal=Anthanor|date=2012|volume=30|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross is made out of [[sycamore]] wood and is entirely covered in gilded [[silver]] and embellished with gemstones and pearls. Inscribed on the back of the cross is the following verse:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Variorum, 2013), 2–3.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|pages=2–3}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=God stretched out his hands upon the wood,
gushing forth through it the energies of life.
And Constantine and Romanos the emperors
have with the addition of radiant stones and pearls
made this same full of wonder.
Upon it Christ formerly smashed the gates of hell,
giving new life to the dead. 
And the crowned ones who have now adorned it,
crush with it the temerities of the barbarians
}}

The two emperors mentioned in the inscription are [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] and [[Romanos II]], his son. They ruled jointly from 945 to 959, meaning that the cross would have been constructed during their rule.

[[File:Couvercle de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]
The box and its sliding, removable lid were made second and is designed to hold the cross reliquary in the center of the box. Surrounding the cross are ten [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] panels that depict angels wearing court outfits. Next to the angels are 10 more panels that each depict a pair of either [[cherubim]] or [[seraphim]]. The panels depicting the cherubim and seraphim are the containers that hold ten relics and each compartment has an inscription that identifies the [[relic]] housed inside. Six relics are Passion relics and are ascribed to [[Christ (title)|Christ]], three to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and one to [[John the Baptist]]. The relics in the compartments of the theke are:
* The swaddling clothes of Jesus
* The sponge used to give Christ water during his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]
* The crown of thorns worn by Christ during his crucifixion
* The winding sheet Christ was wrapped in while in his tomb
* The towel used by Christ to wash the feet of his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] during the [[Last Supper]]
* The purple himation worn by Christ during his crucifixion (mentioned in John 19:2)
* The belt of the Virgin Mary from [[Chalkoprateia]]
* The belt of the Virgin Mary brought from Zela
* The maphorion of the Virgin Mary
* Locks of hair from St. John the Baptist

[[File:LM Staurothek Pantokrator.JPG|thumb|Close up of [[Christ Pantocrator]] on the middle enamel panel of the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]

The lid of the box, like the cross and inner compartments of the theke, is covered in gilded silver and lavishly decorated with gemstones. It features nine enamel panels that portray the [[Deesis]], a scene that depicts Christ in a throne, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist and surrounded by angels. On the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke, Christ is seen in the middle panel, with John the Baptist to his left and the Virgin Mary to his right. The [[archangels]] [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] stand next to John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary.  The top and bottom panels portray the twelve Apostles. On an outer border framing the panels are the busts of eight unidentified figures, though they are likely images of four military saints and four important church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theke itself features an inscription on the outer rim that states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hahn|editor1-first=Cynthia|editor2-last=Klein|editor2-first=Holger A.|title=Saints and Sacred Matter: The Cult of Relics in Byzantium and Beyond|date=2015|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|location=Washington D.C.|page=246}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=No beauty had He, who was hanged on the Wood,
and yet, even in death, Christ surpassed all beauty.
While He had no comely form, He embellished my
unsightly face disfigured by sin and transgression.
For, though He was God, He suffered in mortals’ nature.
Since Basil the Proedros highly revered Him,
he greatly embellished the box of the wood,

on which He was stretched and embraced all creation.
}}  

The inscription reveals that [[Basil Lekapenos]] was the benefactor of the staurotheke. Basil was the bastard son of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] and was made a eunuch likely as a child. He would become a powerful figure in the imperial court. Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] gave him the title of ''[[proedros]]'' in 963. The theke was likely made between 963 and 985, when Basil was exiled from the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pentcheva|first1=Bissera V.|title=Containers of Power: Eunuchs and Reliquaries in Byzantium|date=2007|volume=51|issue=108-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Lovers of Valdaro.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Excavation of archaeological dig from [[Mantua, Italy]].|alt=Lovers of Valdaro]] --&gt;The '''Lovers of Valdaro''', also known as the "'''Valdaro Lovers'''," are a pair of human [[skeleton]]s dated as approximately 6,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Time | title=6,000 Years Later, the 'Lovers of Valdaro' Need a New Home | author = La Stampa / Worldcrunch 	 | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2092970,00.html | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were discovered by archaeologists at a [[Neolithic tomb]] in San Giorgio near [[Mantua]], Italy, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Reuters | title=Scientists to save 5,000-year-old embrace | author = Phil Stewart | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/14/us-italy-embrace-idUSL12831255020070214 | date=February 12, 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=www.stonepages.com | title=Prehistoric skeletons found locked in eternal embrace | author = | url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002264.html | date=February 11, 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two skeletons appear to have died or were interred facing each other with arms around each other, thus reminiscent of a "[[Sexual partner|lovers']] [[Physical intimacy|embrace]]".

Archaeologist Elena Maria Menotti led the excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Daily Mail| title=Locked in an eternal embrace | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-434454/Locked-eternal-embrace.html | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that the pair are a male and female no older than 20 years old at death and approximately {{convert|1.57|m|abbr=on}} in height.

The male skeleton was found with a flint arrowhead near the neck. The female had a long flint blade along the thigh, plus two flint knives under the pelvis. [[Osteology|Osteological]] examination found no evidence of violent death, no fractures, and no microtrauma, so the most likely explanation is the flint tools were buried along with the people as grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= | title=Neolithic lovers seek new home | author = | url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12797 | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their discovery, on 11 April 2014 they were permanently displayed inside a glass case in the National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, museum within the perimeter of the [[Ducal palace, Mantua|Ducal palace of Mantova]].

The skeletons were displayed briefly in public for the first time in September 2011 at the entrance of  National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, thanks to the effort of the association Lovers in Mantua which is seeking a permanent home for the ancient couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= | title=6,000-Year-Old Lovers Make Debut In Italy | author = | url=http://jezebel.com/5839639/6000-year-old-lovers-make-debut-in-italy | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Silvia Bagnoli, the president of Lovers in Mantua, has been campaigning for their right to have a permanent exhibit of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= | title=Locked in Eternal Embrace – The Lovers of Valdaro | author = | url=https://bookofresearch.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/locked-in-eternal-embrace-the-lovers-of-valdaro/ | date=November 28, 2014 | accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mangal Mahadev''' is a 33&amp;nbsp;m (108&amp;nbsp;ft) tall sculpture of the Hindu god [[Shiva]] standing with his [[Trishula]] (trident) at the entrance of [[Ganga Talao]] (Grand Bassin), a crater lake situated in the district of [[Savanne District|Savanne]] in [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="Berlitz: Mauritius Pocket Guide 2016 p. 78"&gt;{{cite book

== Inauguration ==
Mangal Mahadev Monument was inaugurated in 2007 and the "Sthapan" was done during the Maha Shivratri period of 2008. It is considered the most sacred [[Hindu]] place in Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/album/Mauritius/slides/Grand%20Bassin.html Bird's eye view] Retrieved on 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are temples dedicated to other Gods including [[Durga]], [[Hanuman]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Ganesh]] around the Shiva Temple and Mangal Mahadev statue on the banks of the Grand Bassin. During [[Shivaratri]], many pilgrims in Mauritius walk bare feet from their homes to the lake and pray at the feet of the sculpture.

'''Merz (art style)''' is a [[synonym]] for the more common expression and term [[Dada]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Richard Huelsenbeck (Ed.): ''Dada Almanach''. New York, Something Else Press, 1966 (reprint of the 1920-edition).&lt;/ref&gt; and traces back to [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monograph 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981. {{ISBN|3499502968}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The made-up word ''Merz'', however, traces back to Kurt Schwitters, who planned a Dada section in Hanover. But not being invited to the First International Dada Fair in Berlin in 1920, Schwitters was on the look-out for a ''totally unique hat fitting only a single head"— his own''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monographien 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981, p. 19 f. {{ISBN|3499502968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Original German quote translated by Arguseyed2200).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The very moment==
He found ''Merz'' by chance when creating a collage with the German word ''Kom'''merz''''' (commerce). The result: a nonsensical‚ dadaistic’ word. ''Merz'' became Schwitters 's very synonym for his own way of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Kurt Schwitters, 1887-1948: Urwerk'', Edited by Robert Galitz/Kurt Kreiler/Klaus Gabbert. Frankfurt am Main/Berlin 1986. {{ISBN|3-549-06667-8}}. New Edition: Zweitausendeins, Frankfurt am Main, 2007. {{ISBN|9783861506744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The very reception==
Kurt Schwitters, father of installation art and  a pioneer in fusing collage and abstraction—those two most transformative innovations of the 20th century art— influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]],  the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Joseph Beuys]], too.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Kurt Schwitters — Space, Image, Exile'' by Megan R. Luke. 352 p., 22 color plates, 98 halftones. University of Chicago, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17192">'''[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], 1st  Duke of Bronté''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KB2}} (29 September 1758&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1805) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[flag officer]] in the [[Royal Navy]] famous for his participation in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], most notably in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], during which he was killed.  He was responsible for several famous victories that helped to secure British control of the seas, both securing Britain from French invasion and frustrating [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] imperial ambitions.  After his death during his defeat of the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, there was a public outpouring of grief.  Nelson was accorded a [[state funeral]] and was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].  
[[File:Glasgow Green, Nelson Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Nelson Monument, Glasgow|Nelson Monument]] on [[Glasgow Green]], erected in 1806, is claimed to be the first civic monument in Britain to Nelson's victories.]]

A number of '''monuments and memorials''' were constructed across the country to honour his memory.  The period of British dominance of the seas that his victories were considered to have ushered in led to a continued drive to create monuments in his name across the [[British Empire]].  These have taken many forms.

==Sited in the UK==
[[File:Lord Nelson, Nelson's Column.JPG|thumb|left|Lord Nelson atop [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].]]
The monumental [[Nelson's Column]] (built in 1840s) and the surrounding [[Trafalgar Square]] are notable locations in [[London]] to this day, and Nelson's funerary monument can be found in the south transept of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. There are three great collections of items that belonged to him, or were made to commemorate him that are still visible today: at the [[Royal Naval Museum]] in [[HMNB Portsmouth]], at the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]] and in the [[Lloyd's building]] in the heart of London. Also at Portsmouth, Nelson's [[flagship]] at Trafalgar, {{HMS|Victory}} is preserved; on the [[quarterdeck]], a small [[brass]] plaque with the inscription "Here Nelson fell 21st Oct 1805" records the place where Nelson was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-victory.com/things-to-see/quarter-deck |title=HMS Victory - Things To See - The Quarter Deck |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.hms-victory.com |publisher=National Museum of the Royal Navy |access-date=8 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large monument to Nelson was the {{convert|43.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[Nelson Monument, Glasgow|Nelson Monument]] on [[Glasgow Green]] erected less than a year after his death in 1806. The [[Nelson Monument, Edinburgh|Nelson Monument in Edinburgh]] was later constructed atop [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]] between 1807 and 1816. The first monument in the [[British Empire]] to be funded by popular subscription was [[Nelson's Column, Montreal]], on August 17, 1809. In October 1809, the first monument to be funded by public subscription in Great Britain was erected in Birmingham. [[Statue of Horatio Nelson, Birmingham|The statue of Nelson in Birmingham]] was the first to be erected in Nelson's honour in Great Britain. It was sculpted by [[Richard Westmacott]] and is currently a [[Grade II* listed building]]. Westmacott also sculpted memorials in [[Liverpool]], which is also Grade II*, and [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]]. The [[Nelson Monument, Liverpool|Liverpool monument]] is a depiction of a goddess handing a naked Nelson the crowns of victory while a sinister, skeletal figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]] clutches at his breast. Four despondent French prisoners-in-chains sit at the base.  
[[File:Nelson Monument, Liverpool.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Nelson Monument, Liverpool|Nelson Monument]] in [[Liverpool]].]]

The officers and men who fought at Trafalgar erected [[The Nelson Monument, Portsdown Hill|a memorial column]] to the north of Portsmouth atop [[Portsdown Hill]].  The {{convert|36.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high obelisk features the inscription "Consecrated to the memory of Viscount Lord Nelson. By the zealous attachment of all those who fought at Trafalgar to perpetuate his triumph and their regret 1805. Foundation stone laid July 1807".

The {{convert|44|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[Britannia Monument|columnar Monument in Great Yarmouth]] to Nelson was started before his death but only completed in 1819. Properly called the Norfolk Naval Pillar, it is generally known as the "[[Britannia]] Monument" as it is topped by the martial female personification of the UK rather than a statue of Nelson; a statue of Nelson is, however, in the grounds of [[Norwich Cathedral]] alongside the other Napoleonic hero, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], near [[Norwich School (independent school)|the school]] he attended. Another columnar monument is situated on Castle Geen, [[Hereford]]. Nelson was made a freeman of the city in 1802, and he reportedly spent a lot of time at [[Ross-on-Wye]]. The column was erected in 1809, four years after Nelson's death, but has no statue at the top as there wasn't enough money left to commission one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2005/10/18/nelsons_column_feature.shtml |title=Why Nelson has a column in Hereford |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual monuments was constructed on Salisbury Plain, within cannon shot of Stonehenge, on land then owned by the Marquess of Queensberry. The monument consists of a series of clumps of trees in otherwise arable farmland. Known as the [[Nile Clumps]] they have been arranged to represent the positioning of French and British ships at the [[Battle of the Nile]], considered as Nelson's greatest tactical victory. Some clumps still survive, and work is underway to replant some of those that have "sunk". They stand on land owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], forming part of the [[Stonehenge Landscape]] estate.

There is also a memorial to Nelson on the banks of the [[Menai Strait]] in [[North Wales]]. This memorial stands at an out-of-the-way site on the shore below Plas Llanfair, in [[Llanfairpwll]] on the [[Anglesey]] shore. It was created by Admiral [[Lord Clarence Paget]], who lived in the mansion and who was an enthusiastic amateur sculptor. The monument is made of stone, inscribed with the words "Nelson" on the base of the statue. The words "Fell at Trafalgar 1805" are ingraved in slate on the west side of the plinth and repeated in welsh on the east side. On the south side is a slate engraved with "England expects that every man will do his duty". The view from this position is of the Menai Strait, which Nelson was reputed to have described as "''one of the most treacherous stretches of sea in the world.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anglesey.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=2012 |title=Lord Nelson Memorial, Anglesey |publisher=Discover Anglesey's Heritage | date=2006-01-03 |accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Nelson Memorial, Swarland|Nelson memorial]] in [[Swarland]], [[Northumberland]] which was raised as a private memorial of Nelson by his friend and sometime agent, Alexander Davison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/memorials/Memorial.cfm?Banner=3&amp;MemorialPage=3&amp;MemorialID=M4322 |title=Maritime Memorials List ,M4322 |publisher=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson also planted trees just to the west of the obelisk to represent the coastline of the Nile Delta and some of the ships that took part in the Battle of the Nile.

A small memorial to Nelson is located in the small [[County Antrim]] town of [[Dervock]], [[Northern Ireland]]. In the Allen Memorial Hall belonging to St Coleman’s Church of Ireland, a large stained glass triptych depicts the moment on the poop deck of the Victory when Nelson ordered the flying of the ‘England Expects’ signal just before the Battle of Trafalgar. The connection with Dervock is seen in the panel portraying the red-jacketed Captain William Adair, from Ballymena, in County Antrim, the commander of the marine force on the Victory, who was to die alongside Nelson. A smaller window in the hall shows the Victory locked in conflict with the French ship Redoubtable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dublin’s Fallen Hero:The Long Life and Sudden Death of Nelson’s Pillar (1809-1966) {{ISBN|978-0957256415}},  by [[Dennis Campbell Kennedy|Dennis Kennedy]].

Although his country house at Merton no longer exists and his estate was broken up and built over, Nelson's association with the area is commemorated in the names of a number of local roads, a trading estate on part of his former lands and Nelson Hospital in [[Merton Park]]. Nelson's [[funerary hatchment]] is displayed at St. Mary's Church of England, also in Merton Park, London SW19.

There is a Nelson's Monument on [[Birchen Edge]], in the [[Peak District]] national park in [[Derbyshire]]. The monument itself consists of a 3 metre tall [[gritstone]] obelisk, surmounted by a ball 30 cm in diameter. The column is inscribed with the date of Nelson's death and some other letters which may be later [[graffiti]]. A modern metal plaque shows that the monument was restored in 1992 by the [[1805 Club]] and the [[Peak District National Park]]. Three nearby gritstone outcrops, known as the "Three Ships" because of their slight resemblance to ships' prows, are inscribed ''VICTORY'', ''[[HMS Defiance (1783)|DEFIANCE]]'' and ''[[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|ROYAL SOVERIN]]'' (''[[sic]]''), named after British warships at Trafalgar. The monument was created in 1810 and is thought to have been funded by John Brightman from the local village of [[Baslow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://derbyshirewarmemorials.com/ddales/57257/57257.html |title=Adm Lord Nelson - Nelson's Monument |last=Branson |first=Roy |date= |website=derbyshirewarmemorials.com |publisher=Derbyshire War Memorials |access-date=8 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, in honour of Nelson, The [[Admiral Lord Nelson School]] was built in Portsmouth. The school has established and maintains strong links with the [[Royal Navy]] and was involved in the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] commemoration of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

There are a hundred and ninety-nine street names in the U.K. today that refer to Nelson's final and possibly greatest victory, Trafalgar.&lt;ref&gt;U.K. Streetmap&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 survey of British [[pub names]] found seventy-eight [[pub]]s called "Lord Nelson", thirty-one called "Nelson", five called "Admiral Nelson" and five "Nelson's"; in addition, sixteen pubs were named "Trafalgar" and thirty-two "Victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 April 2011 |title=A thousand rather popular pubs...

Throughout October, [[Trafalgar Night]] dinners are held in Royal Navy ships and establishments. After the Loyal Toast, there is always a toast drunk to Nelson's "Immortal Memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Nelson Encyclopaedia |last=White |first=Colin |year=2002 |publisher=Chatham Publishing, Lionel Leventhal Limited |location=Park House, Russell Gardens, London |isbn=1-86176-253-4 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several places overseas have been named after Nelson. The city of [[Nelson, New Zealand]] bears his name as well as [[Nelson Island (British Columbia)|Nelson Island]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia]], Canada. There is also [[Nelson's Island]], in [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]], the site of Nelson's victory at the [[Battle of the Nile]].

Two pillars were erected to Nelson in cities in [[Montreal]] and [[Dublin]], both by public subscription in the second half of 1809. [[Nelson's Pillar]] in Dublin survived controversy and rebellion and Ireland’s exit from the United Kingdom in 1922, but it was destroyed by a bomb planted by former [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] men in 1966, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Nelson's Column, Montreal]] is located in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (where Nelson had reportedly fallen in love with a young woman). The monument was begun in 1808 and erected in 1809. It is located in [[Place Jacques-Cartier]], which was a marketplace at the time. As the Dublin monument is no longer extant it is the oldest surviving monument to Nelson. Subscribers for the monument included both English and French, since the [[French Revolution]] was popular with neither. The monument is located in [[Old Montreal]] (''Vieux Montréal''). It has carved scenes from Nelson's career around the base and the statue on top was claimed to be the oldest public statue of Nelson in the world. It was removed due to excessive weathering and has been placed in the Montreal History Centre. A copy now stands atop the column in its place.

A small monument was erected to Nelson in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. It is claimed that it was erected within four days of the news of the admiral’s death reaching London on 6 November 1805. The monument consisted of a large rough stone arch on a hilltop near [[Castletownshend]]. It was destroyed 150 years later by Irish republicans. This Nelson Arch, as it was known, was the work of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson RN, then commander of the [[Sea Fencibles]] based in Castletownshend. One of the few surviving images of the arch dates from 1896. It is a photograph reproduced in the Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, and shows the arch largely intact, but with vegetation sprouting from it. The first mention of politically motivated damage to the arch comes in 1920, when according to some accounts it was ‘destroyed’ during the War of Independence, and re-erected two years later. It was again attacked in 1966, this time so seriously that the Townshend family, who whose land it stood, could do little more than erect a much smaller version from the wreckage. That in turn was demolished in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dublin’s Fallen Hero:The Long Life and Sudden Death of Nelson’s Pillar (1809-1966) {{ISBN|978-0957256415}}, by [[Dennis Campbell Kennedy|Dennis Kennedy]].  Ormeau Books, Belfast 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the island of Nevis, West Indies, where Nelson met and married [[Frances Nisbet]], there are two place names: Nelson's Spring and Nelson's Lookout.

On the island of [[Antigua]], West Indies, there is a house at [[Nelson's Dockyard]] that is historically taught to be Nelson's house while he was stationed in the Caribbean.

On 28 October 2005, a statue of Nelson was unveiled in [[Gibraltar]] 200 years after Nelson's death.

In 1813,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/placesofInterest.htm |title=Places of Interest |publisher=Government of Barbados |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113144604/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/placesofInterest.htm |archivedate=13 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a statue (pictured) was erected in [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], in what was known as Trafalgar Square, (now renamed [[National Heroes' Square]]) in recognition of Nelson's bravery and as a tribute to his honour within the British Empire. This statue was sculpted from bronze by Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] and is considered by many as an exact likeness to the man himself. This statue was erected some 27 years before another one of the same likeness was erected in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39443">The '''Nazario Collection''' ({{lang-es|Colección Nazario}}),&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; also known as '''Agüeybaná's Library''' ({{lang-es|Biblioteca de Agüeybaná|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; '''Father Nazario's Rocks''' ({{lang-es|Piedras del Padre Nazario|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; and the '''Phoenician Rocks''' ({{lang-es|Piedras Fenicias|links=no}}), is the name commonly used to describe a cache of carved stones that originated at [[Guayanilla, Puerto Rico]]. According to contemporary accounts, the statuettes made of local serpentine rocks were first discovered by Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel during the 19th century, and feature unidentified [[petroglyphs]] that have been speculated to be connected to the [[Old World]] for over 130 years.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; Their original site was not far from Yauco and was underground, where it was hidden under a slate that concealed a tunnel.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Overwhelmed with the quantity and difficulty of transporting a trove that totaled more than a ton, he opted to abandon his individual approach and recruited locals to aid in the moving of the rocks to his house, where he conducted the first research on them by comparing them to similar objects from other countries.&lt;ref name="Coll"/&gt; Nazario would combine his research with his religious background, leading to the hypothesis that there might be some connection between them and the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].

Due to the ramifications that their authentication would have on mainstream concepts of Pan-American history, the authenticity of the pieces has been in question from the onset, with researchers providing conflicting opinions.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; Despite this, several foreign archeologists traveled to Puerto Rico in order to study the pieces.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ENDI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/piedrasantiguasreescribenlahistoria-2173532/|title=Piedras antiguas reescriben la historia|author=Gerardo E. Alvarado León|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those that inquired on the matter was ethnographer [[Alphonse Pinart]], who examined the pieces and concluded that they were "undoubtedly authentic".&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; The explorer also expressed concern that some people could try to falsify pieces to receive gifts in exchange from them.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;  Locally, historians took an interest in the matter while archeologists did not study them for decades.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; After the death of Nazario, most pieces were kept at the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]] (ICP), with others being kept by the UPR and foreign institutions in New York, Spain and Paris.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; During the 1980s, the Collection attracted historian Salvador Tío, who tried to recruit a variety of institutions to the cause of studying the pieces.

During the 2010s, the study of the pieces has been taken by personnel of the archeology department of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] [[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado|at Utuado]]. Head archeologist Reniel Rodríguez decided to follow the scientific method to test several characteristics of the rocks and petroglyphs.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Among these are geological studies, which concluded that the petroglyphs were carved in Puerto Rico and that the rocks were likely not brought from abroad based on the raw materials used, serpentine rocks found near location of the discovery.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Another aspect of Rodríguez's research is based on using high power microscopes to determine the technique and instruments used to make the carvings, thus allowing for the detection of fraud if the tools are found not to have been available during the time.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Preliminary results from this area suggest that the technique used was unlike any of the ones used by the known native groups of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;
A new epigraphic study is also being conducted to determine the precedence of the petroglyphs or their closest parallels.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Preliminary results in this area have found similarities between the petroglyphs and the [[Tifinagh#Origins|Libyco-Berber]] alphabet as recorded in the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Tartessian language]] of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; During this research, Rodríguez has recruited experts from [[Universidad del Turabo]] and [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Additional studies planned include C-14 dating and thermoluminescence tests for burned pieces.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

==Discovery and relocation==
===Exploration at Río Coayuco===
[[File:José María Nazario y Cancel.jpg|thumb|José M. Nazario in clergical clothing.]]
The discovery of the rocks is attributed to Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel, a native of the municipality of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] that had settled in Guayanilla and had received education at the [[University of Salamanca]] that included, among other things, the study of ancient languages.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;{{efn|Nazario was first appointed priest of Guayanilla in 1866, serving the office for 46 years.&lt;ref name="EVT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvisitante.biz/new/component/content/article/54-tu-revista-es-vida/886-la-gesta-cultural-del-padre-nazario|title=La gesta cultural del padre Nazario|publisher=''El Visitante''|language=Spanish|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his archeological and philosophical research and a particular interest in the influence of the Agüeybaná dynasty in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; Nazario was also an author and published ''Guayanilla y la Historia de Puerto Rico'', in which he analyzed the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] and cited evidence for the likelihood that the municipality was the landing point of this expedition at Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt;}} The popular story of the event was told by the priest to historian [[Adolfo de Hostos]].&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periodicovision.com/buscan-conocer-origen-de-piedras-del-padre-nazario/|title=Buscan conocer origen de piedras del padre Nazario|publisher=''Periódico Visión''|language=Spanish|date=2015-09-09|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this narrative, sometime during the late 1870s the minister was summoned to the deathbed of a local woman of [[Taíno]] ascent.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; There she, who was aware of Nazario's interest in archeology and native history, decided to reveal the location of a long-hidden collection of artifacts.&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticel.com/noticia/189148/piedras-antiguas-de-guayanilla-podrian-alterar-la-historia-oficial.html|title=Piedras antiguas de Guayanilla podrían alterar la historia oficial|author=Gabriela Saker Jímenez|publisher=[[NotiCel]]|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-16|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge had been covertly passed from generation to generation throughout the centuries, but she decided to reveal it in hopes that the priest would recognize its historical importance and safeguard it from that point on.&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt; With time, the old woman was given the name of "Juana Morales" and was claimed to be "the last descendant" of [[Agüeybaná II]] or Agüeybaná El Bravo, the last ruler of the Puerto Rico natives and military leader during the [[Spanish–Taíno War of San Juan–Borikén]] (from whom the rocks get one of their colloquial namesakes), elements that were not found in the original version.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; There is no record of an elder person by that name dying during the time in the municipality’s records, but there is a local Morales family that lives at Barrio Indio and has its own oral tradition of the events dating back to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Nazario then traveled between municipalities until he arrived at a riverside location in what is now speculated to have been the modern barrio Los Indios, reaching a stone slab that was meant as a marker.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; Digging the terrain, the priest found a tunnel and continued rummaging until he reached an alcove within which were more than 800 rocks and stones of varying sizes several of which had anthropomorphic shape, all covered in unknown petroglyphs that did not match any Amerindian civilization known to have lived in Puerto Rico or the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Coll"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cayetano Coll y Toste: Síntesis de estímulos humanos|chapter=El Padre Nazario|author=Edna Coll|publisher=Editorial Universitaria (University of Puerto Rico)|language=Spanish|year=1970|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1880 onwards, the rocks were taken to Nazario's personal house at Guayanilla, not the parochial house, where he kept the other fragments of this finding and several other archeological pieces as part of his collection.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|The structure was worth 250 Spanish pesos and he established an impromptu museum within it.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;}} Nazario gave the people involved in the extraction a modest reward for bringing pieces there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1883, [[Agustín Stahl]] and [[Román Baldorioty de Castro]] visited the house and discussed the possibility of creating the Puerto Rico Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

===Early research===
Nazario named them ''antropoglifitas'' (hispanized from the Greek "antropōmorphos", which relates to having human-like characteristics, and "gluphē", which refers to carvings) and considered each individual piece a volume in a larger story.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"/&gt; In his writings, Nazario stated that they had been found packed in a small area and at a distance that was "not extraordinarily away from Guayanilla", speculating if they had been hidden there to avoid being lost at war (between the local and foreign natives) due to its proximity to the chiefdom of Agüeybaná.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The priest was close to physician and author [[Manuel Zeno Gandía]], with whom he exchanged correspondence and would later join him in a historical debate over the location of Columbus' arrival to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario gave him two pieces of the Collection to him and requested that they were kept safe and close.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1881, when Zeno Gandía was chosen as representative of the Puerto Rican media in the activities held to commemorate [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]'s second centenary in Spain, he took the pieces to the founder of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología (Madrid)|Museo Nacional de Antropología]], Pedro González de Velasco, who according to the author insisted in keeping one of them.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; An agreement was reached between both, where the Spaniard accepted naming it after Nazario and gave credit to its discovery in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; This event caused a temporary estrangement between Zeno Gandía and the priest.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; After González de Velasco died the following year, the destination of the piece became unknown.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The first formal mention of the Collection was made by Alphonse Pinart in 1890, noting that the discovery was made near Yauco, in a place that he identifies as "Hanoa, Puerto Rico", and that some pieces displayed signs of being "undoubtedly authentic", but assumed that unscrupulous people fabricated their own to receive a reward.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He further noted similarities between the characters in the Collection and known ancient alphabets, but declined speculating further on the matter.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Pinart also embarked some pieces with him to the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] from which they were moved to the [[Musée du quai Branly]] when the former institution closed down, 38 pieces remain there and form the largest known concentration outside of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario later noted that besides France, other pieces had been taken by the researcher to Copenhagen and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

In 1893, Nazario wrote a piece named ''Escritura Aborigen de Carib'' (English: "Aboriginal writing of the Carib"), where he detailed his interpretations of the petroglyphs.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|"Carib" was the term used by Nazario when discussing the Taíno.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"/&gt;}} Analyzing the inscriptions, he dismissed a Taíno or [[Arawak]] origin and by 1897 had concluded that the carvings were more reminiscent of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] languages, saying that he recognized some of the characters present.&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elvocero.com/las-piedras-antiguas-de-guayanilla-una-historia-que-puede-cambiar-la-historia/|title=Las piedras antiguas de Guayanilla: una historia que puede cambiar….la historia|author=Ileanexis Vera Rosado|publisher=''[[El Vocero]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazario also asserted that based on the study of the petroglyphs, it was safe to conclude that the Pre-Columbian inhabitants of Puerto Rico had perfected writing beyond the natives of Mexico or Peru, speculating that the pieces could have been a Pre-Columbian national archive of some kind.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guayanilla y la historia de Puerto Rico|author=José María Nazario y Cancel|chapter=Prueba directa del arribaje de Colón en Guayanilla, deducidas las huellas de un pueblo caribitano fundado en la Playa. Residencia del cacique Augueybana.|publisher=Impresora de la Revista de Puerto Rico|language=Spanish|year=1893|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazario would then begin an effort to translate the characters phonetically after acquiring a copy of 1889's ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea'' (English: "History of the Nations: Chaldea") and using the characters present in a Babylonian religious artifact reproduced there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The document would be modified and later become known as ''Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico'' (English: "Phonetic orthography of the Indians of Puerto Rico").&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario hypothesized that perceived linguistic similarities could imply that some of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] crossed Asia making their way into the [[Bering Strait]] and traveled from there to North America, before dividing somewhere near Central America, from where they arrived to the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The conclusions reached by Nazario were met with skepticism by mainstream archeologists who labeled him as "imaginative [and/or] crazy",&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; as it implied contact with the New World prior to Columbus' voyages, and speculation emerged that he had paid a local [[jíbaro]] (a class of Puerto Rican countrymen) to sculpt the stones with a machete and that the petroglyphs were meaningless. In 1894, Nazario met [[Cayetano Coll y Toste]], which whom he had been involved in a number of historical debates, at San Juan.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Both discussed the possibility of the historian aiding in the process of deciphering the characters in the Collection, but the effort was aborted when the condition of sending the pieces to San Juan (to be returned later) was proposed.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; According to historian Otto Sievens, several of the rocks were thrown into a cistern at Guayanilla's church when the Americans arrived during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5172:la-historia-se-reescribe-con-las-piedras-de-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|title=Piedras de Guayanilla reescriben historia|author=Hector Sánchez|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2013-06-12|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, Nazario was holding conferences about the Collection, which were unsuccessful in gaining the desired attention.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

That same year, [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], visited Puerto Rico and reportedly offered Nazario $800 to buy the pieces, but the offer was declined.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; In his subsequent report, the anthropologist concluded that the assemblage was the most intricate one among those that gathered native petroglyphs in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Fewkes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbu0v25powe/annualreportofbu0v25powe_djvu.txt|title=Annual report of the Bureau of ethnology to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution|author=John Wesley Powell|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his examination of the carvings Fewkes also commented that the inscriptions were not Amerindian in origin and labeled them as "exotic", leading to an assumption that they may not be ancient.&lt;ref name="Fewkes"/&gt; In his field notes, Fewkes notes that he was unable to find Nazario during a first visit in 1902, returning the following year.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He also stated that the entire Collection was under a roof, that the pieces were classified by priority, and that the priest gave him his writings (which he discarded as not being authored by a scientist).&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Despite his skepticism, Fewkes took some pieces with him, which he placed in an exhibit along pieces of dubious origin at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] based on his initial assessment.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; This led to unrelated American archeologists assuming that the rocks were a forgery, discontinuing their investigation for several decades.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Influenced by their foreign peer, local archeologists also lost interest in the Collection and stopped their inquiry for decades.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

In an interview held in 1905, the priest showed ''Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico'' to journalist Gabriel A. Piles and discussed hypotheses about the arrival of Old World travelers as well as his efforts to translate the characters using ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea''.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Between 1911 and 1912, Nazario was transferred to San Juan while facing health issues. After being relocated, the priest had the Collection moved to the capital and kept it in his room.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1908, Nazario wrote to Zeno Gandía informing him that a letter from Pinart had arrived, in the process making a throwaway remark noting that "it was almost incredible that 28 years [had already passed since their first meeting]", which would later allow to date the philologist's visit to 1880 and placed the original date of discovery sometime during the late 1870s.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|Nazario had been moved away from Guayanilla for some time, so the discovery had to take place between his return to the office in 1875 and Pinart's visit in 1880.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;}} During this decade, [[Samuel Kirkland Lothrop]] visited Puerto Rico and took some pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Archeologist [[Adolfo de Hostos]] visited Nazario in San Juan, where he was told the now-popular origin story.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Taking some pieces with him, Hostos was still not convinced that the Collection (which at this point he estimates rounds the 700 pieces) possessed cuneiform characters, but still felt that it required detailed study.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; With the death of Nazario in 1919, the pieces became segregated, with only around 250 being acquired by collector Robert Junhans and later preserved at the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]].&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; The first pieces arrived there during the 1950s, where they were placed in storage.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The pieces in Hostos possession were granted to the University of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; These were relocated to the Museo de Historia, Antropología y Arte at Río Piedras.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The ones owned by Lothrop were sent to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]].&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Alice de Santiago, a school teacher from Barceloneta, reportedly found a piece that was similar to those in possession of Nazario but made in limestone and contacted Zeno Gandía.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The current whereabouts of this rock are unknown.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

A number of writings authored by Nazario where later recovered by Zeno Gandía, who republished them in ''[[El Imparcial]]'' and claimed that he had seen Martin J. Berntsen of the Dominican priests of Bayamon taking some of the documents once his friend died, with the documents later being found by a priest in the parochial archives there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The origin story was first published by Hostos more than three decades later in 1955, having already deviated slightly from its original account by integrating elements related to the adaptation of the account to then-concurrent concepts.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZECSNhTyhU&amp;app=desktop|title=Reniel Rodríguez Ramos: Piedras Padre Nazario|publisher=Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe (official YouTube channel)|language=Spanish|date=2016-05-22|accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he discussed a booklet filled with notes from Nazario being the last known person to be see the lost document.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

==Media exposure==
===Late 20th century===
In 1969, Hostos sent one of the pieces to the [[British Museum]] so that it could be studied by scholar C.B.F. Walker, author of a number of books on cuneiform writing.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Afterwards, Walker responded with an assessment that it possessed characteristics similar to pieces recorded circa 2000 B.C. and that it could be Sumerian in origin.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; During the 1980s, the president of the ''Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia'' (English: "Puerto Rican Academy of History") Aurelio Tió revived the debate surrounding the pieces and began insisting on the thorough study of the inscriptions, citing that the idea that they were randomly inscribed with a machete was implausible.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; This historian dismissed the prevailing conclusions surrounding the rocks, noting that too much emphasis had been given to Fewkes' insinuation and that, despite the lack of formal studies by the anthropologist, it had somehow become widely accepted among local archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boletín de la Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia, vol. 6|chapter=Las antropoglifitas del Padre Nazario y su possible relación con el predominio del cacicazgo de Guaybana|author=Aurelio Tío|publisher=Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia|date=Jul 1980|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tío argued that if authenticated, the Collection could potentially represent one of the biggest archeological finds in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, a position that he defended until his death.&lt;ref name="Interes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/cultura/nota/altointeresporlaspiedrasantiguasdeguayanilla-2194592/|title=Alto interés por las piedras antiguas de Guayanilla|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-05-03|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt; He unsuccessfully tried encouraging the Smithsonian, [[Harvard University]], [[University of Valladolid]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[British Museum]] and archeologist Marcel Sigrist to retake the study of the pieces.&lt;ref name="PLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5154:aunque-muchos-lo-nieguen-ila-clave-esta-en-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105093402/http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5154:aunque-muchos-lo-nieguen-ila-clave-esta-en-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|title=Guayanilla: pieza clave de nuestra historia|author=Hector Sánchez|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2013-06-05|archivedate=2003-11-05|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Tío wrote over 30 papers on the Collection evaluating its potential significance to local history and the possible influence on the Taíno population, which did not receive academic examination or rebuttals from the archeological community.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; He also commissioned a professional photographer to capture the first high quality images of the pieces, which were to be re-published in the media.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Linguists from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and France were  involved in the issue, with the latter concluding that they could be legitimate.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt;

===Phoenician hypothesis===
Despite not meeting with immediate success, the attempt to bring the topic to the mainstream did gather the interest of peripheral groups such as the Midwestern Epigraphic Society, which considered the pieces authentic in a report and established parallels between the symbols present in the petroglyphs and similar inscriptions present in cooper and gold slabs recovered in Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Fell"&gt;{{cite book|title=Epigraphic Society Occasional Publications, Vol. 16|author=Barry Fell|chapter=Inscribed Stone Artifacts from Guayanilla, Puerto Rico|publisher=Midwestern Epigraphic Society|year=1987|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Barry Fell]] concluded that the inscriptions were not random, and that the characters correspond to Pre-Greek characters found in Cyprus, Turkey and Crete, rearranged so that they would be phonetically read in Pre-Incan [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]].&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The speculation being that ancient Cyprians had previously interacted with the South American ethnic group and learned to write that language with their alphabet before reaching Puerto Rico and doing the same with the local population.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; According to Fell, evidence suggesting the authenticity of the petroglyphs emerged with the discovery (along the relevant civilization) of a similar grid-based and acrostic language by Pedro I. Porrás Garcés at Ecuador in 1961, which was first detailed in his an article titled "Arqueología de la Región Oriental" (English: "Archeology of the Oriental Region").&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The document also notes similarities with characters present in the royal robe of [[Viracocha Inca]], leading to the hypothesis that they were [[huaca]]s and that one particular piece was dedicated to a request to Mamai, the title invested to the Incan queen.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; Fell concludes that the Collection would represent the largest finding related to this culture and the only one outside South America.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The report gathered some interest, but conflicting views within the mainstream media resulted in stagnation of the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.isla.net/cronista/el_padre.htm |title=El Padre Nazario: A 166 años de su natalicio |author=Norberto Lugo Negrón |publisher=''Periódico Regional El Cronista'' |language=Spanish |date=September 2004 |accessdate=June 4, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131071945/http://personal.isla.net/cronista/el_padre.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public exhibitions===
After the death of Salvador Tió, others that have promoted the topic include Antonio Molina and his daughter, Zoé Tió.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In Guayanilla, biographer Norbeto Lugo and Irvin Sepúlveda have made efforts to foment the study on the pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 2008, interest in the pieces surrounded the 175th Anniversary of the municipality's foundation.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; It was due to this celebration, where interest in Guayanilla's history peaked, that arrangements were made to have the Collection in public exhibition for the first time and the first time in decades that the topic returned to the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/isla/nota/exponenpiedrasdelpadrenazario-161850/|title=Exponen Piedras del padre Nazario|publisher=''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''|language=Spanish|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition took place between March 27 and 28 at the behest of Leandro Hernández, director of the ''Centro Cultural María Arzola'' (English: "María Arzola Cultural Center") which also hosted the pieces.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; The municipal administration of Guayanilla then announced arrangements to have them permanently moved there in order to exhibit them.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; During the following year, interest in the Collection grew and the municipality began efforts to create the ''Museo de Epigrafía Lítica Padre Nazario'' (English: "Father Nazario Museum of Lithic Epigraphy") to emphasize them.&lt;ref name="Museo2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/cultura/nota/porlapreservaciondelaarqueologia-613075/|title=Por la preservación de la arqueología|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the finding became a central argument against the creation of an eolic park in the region.&lt;ref name="Museo2009"/&gt; Upon opening, the museum featured a permanent exhibition where 19 pieces of the Collection were on display, among other archeological exhibitions relevant to the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KWHVpi_d6R8J:www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D6182%26Itemid%3D342&amp;num=1&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=pr&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0|title=Exposición colectiva digna de admiración|author=Reinaldo Millán|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2014-06-18|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic re-entered the mainstream media in April 2016, with coverage related to a conference covering his research that was organized by Zoé Tió.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

==Recent research==
===Studies on composition and characteristics===

In 2012, research on the pieces returned to the mainstream academia with the involvement of  Reniel Rodríguez Ramos from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado]], who was concerned that up to that point most of the local research had been carried by historians.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;{{efn|Rodríguez is a lithic artifact expert and Ripley B. Bullen Award winner for "Outstanding Research in Caribbean Archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohemis.uprm.edu/espa/docs/Vita_RenielRodriguez.pdf|title=Reniel Rodríguez: Ramos Programa de Ciencias Sociales Universidad de Puerto Rico Recinto de Utuado|publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} During his first visit to the ICP, he encountered part of the Collection being repurposed and the rest in storage.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;  While attending an activity in the British Museum in 2014, Rodríguez took some pieces with him to the cuneiform exhibit, where he was casually presented to C.B.F. Walker while showing [[Jago Cooper]] a copy of Hostos' letter to the now-retired cuneiform expert.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; None of the present gave a definitive answer to their nature, but agreed that further study was needed.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Parallel to this process, a documentary began being prepared by cinematographer Carlos García in collaboration with Rodríguez and his team.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

In terms of characteristics, most pieces depict individuals in what appear to be varying ceremonial postures while wearing headwear and a tunic in which the petroglyphs are present.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The group also examined other characters that deviated from the norm, such as those present at a site within the [[Guánica State Forest]] in an attempt to identify similar inscriptions.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In relation to local natives, analogues are scarce and not identical, with some a similar headwear appearing in a piece unearthed at Tecla in Guayanilla and elements of clothing in idols (and additional symbols) being found at La Hueca in Vieques.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez has been unable to pinpoint the place referred to as "Hanoa, Puerto Rico" in Pinart's notes.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Consequently, the research team carried sample collection in the south western coast of Puerto Rico, in particular the regions of Guayanilla and Yauco assumed to be near the initial discovery, such as Barrio Los Indios and Barina.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; After completing macroscopic examination, the prime matter is consonant with serpentinized peridotite with traces of bastite and mica typical in the region.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Efforts were made by the research team to retrieve as much firsthand information on the origin and history of the pieces as possible.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; With the collaboration of Laura Rodríguez from the [[Bayamón Central University]], the archeologist was able to rummage through the Zeno Gandía Collection (a repository of documents and artifacts that used to belong to him) and retrieve the correspondence between Nazario and the author.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; By establishing the date of Pinart's first visit, Rodríguez attempted to prove if Nazario had access to sources detailing ancient writing similar to that exhibited in the Collection prior to this.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In this regard, he concluded that since ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea'' was published at least nine years after the visit of Pinart, it could not have been used by Nazario to forge the characters.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He also acquired Fewke's field notes with the help of Roberto Martínez.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez tried to pinpoint the location of González de Velasco's piece, but was told that it is no longer part of the Museo Nacional de Antropología's Puerto Rico exhibit.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The archeologist discussed how to proceed with people from a number of fields, including geology, chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; To determine the chemical characteristics of the pieces, Antonio Martínez of the Physics Department of the UPR and Pablo Llerandi of General Studies at [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus]] (UPR-RP) have been involved in an initiative to complete studies on X-ray diffraction and spectrography, in order to further pinpoint the properties of the prime matter.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In order to determine the characteristics of the traces the high power microscopes of the UPR-RP were used to carry out high magnification studies in which perpendicular striations were noted as part of a pointer drag technique.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Some pieces do display characters that were added later than those in the others, implying that some were created afterwards.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; However, the manner in which some of the pieces have been [[erosion|intemperized]] (in particular the presence of differential intemperization in some that has rounded the edges of fractures in only one of the sides) is inconsistent with them being fabrications that were forged in the late 1870s and then stored indoors ever since, instead suggesting that they were exposed to the elements for a prolonged time period.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Further efforts are being made to fund a collaboration with [[Leiden University]] to advance this research area with their specialists.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Carlos Silva of [[Universidad del Turabo]] has been involved in the 3D scanning of the pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The high definition imaging has led to the interest of philologist [[Christopher Rollston]], whom Rodríguez considers a candidate to attempt the falsification of the Old World hypothesis.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Studies in thermoluminescence have been proposed to establish the last time that the rocks were set on fire.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Some of the artifacts were burned after the traces were made, with the pieces that fragmented during the process being plausible candidates.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Others have carbon remnants that could be dated by employing the C-14 method.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The general plan is to send separate pieces to the [[University of Washington]] Luminescence Dating Laboratory and to Oxford Authentication to compare results, which Rodríguez considers possibly conclusive.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Towards this end, he has requested additional support from the ICP or the Official Historian of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

===Potential hypotheses===
Based on his research, Rodríguez has formulated a number of hypotheses that are being currently examined without taking an a priori position about their authenticity or the possibility of fraud, with his initial position taking under consideration that some pieces where likely created after the initial discovery.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; If the entire Collection is proven to be fraudulent, he argues that the age of the pieces makes them archeological artifacts in their own right.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez has also formulated a preliminary hypothesis if several of the pieces are certified as authentic, for which he tried to identify similar geodesic characters, since these are not common, and have only been found in the Caribbean at [[Mona Island]], Salto Arriba in Puerto Rico, Bateyes de Viví in Cuba and Piedra Mapa in Santa Marta.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Throughout the rest of the globe, their closest analogues are found at the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez also considers that religious idols found in this archipelago exhibit similar posture and facial features, which were not discovered until after the pieces were reportedly unearthed and he argues that Nazario could not have known.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In terms of character analysis, there are some that are analogue to the [[Tifinagh#Origins|Libyco-Berber]] alphabet found in the Canary Islands.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

After the initial studies, a set of cave paintings was uncovered near Playa Los Tubos, which Rodríguez decided to capture and send to Renata Springer Bunk (a philologist who has authored several books about the Libyco-Berber characters at the Canary Islands) who responded in the affirmative about their nature but lost interest after being told that they were found at Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Ultimately, he combined these with the seafaring nature of Caribbean natives and studies like one in which archeologist Richard Thomas Callahan of the [[University of Calgary]] studied how far the [[Canary Current]] could have dragged a drifting vessel, to formulate a hypothesis that he wants to falsify.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|Callahan has studied the topic and published papers on his research, including a 2015 article titled "Drift Voyages across the Mid-Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9756298|title=Drift voyages across the mid-Atlantic|author=Richard T. Callaghan|publisher=''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''|date=June 2015|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In regards to other hypotheses, Rodríguez is skeptical of Fell's conclusion and notes that some of the words that the zoologist translated as phonetic Quechan such as ''yuca'', ''ungey'', ''chayote'' or ''papaya'' are in fact Arawak in origin.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

'''NORDIK''' Nordic Committee for Art History is an association of [[art historians]] from universities and museum in the Nordic countries. The Committee was founded in [[Helsinki]] in 1984 to promote research networks between Nordic art historians. The main task of the committee since 1984 has been to organize the NORDIK conference every third year in a Nordic country. The board of NORDIK consists members from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and are appointed by the general assembly of NORDIK for a period of three years. The general assembly usually takes place in connection with the NORDIK conferences. The present committee was appointed by the general assembly that took place in connection with NORDIK.X in 2012 in Stockholm, Sweden. Chairman of NORDIK is prof. [[:sv:Jeff Werner|Jeff Werner]], [[Stockholm University]].

'''Proto-Cubism''' (also referred to as '''Protocubism''', '''Pre-Cubism''' or '''Early Cubism''') is an intermediary transition phase in the [[history of art]] chronologically extending from 1906 to 1910. Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist or discourse. With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this period can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with [[Fauvism]]). It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase of an [[art movement]] that would become altogether more extreme, known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].

Proto-Cubist artworks typically depict objects in geometric schemas of cubic or conic shapes. The illusion of classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] is progressively stripped away from objective representation to reveal the constructive essence of the physical world (not just as seen). The term is applied not only to works of this period by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], but to a range of art produced in France during the early 1900s, by such artists as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and to variants developed elsewhere in Europe. Proto-Cubist works embrace many disparate styles, and would affect diverse individuals, groups and movements, ultimately forming a fundamental stage in the history of [[modern art]] of the [[20th-century art|20th-century]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and influences==
The building blocks that lead to the construction of proto-Cubist works are diverse in nature. Neither homogeneous nor isotropic, the progression of each individual artist was unique. The influences that characterize this transition period range from [[Post-Impressionism]], to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]], the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Egypt]]ian, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

In anticipation of Proto-Cubism the idea of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]] had been questioned. The [[Romanticism|romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], the [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Gustave Courbet]], and practically all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had abandoned a significant portion of [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge in contrast to the ''static'' means of expression promoted by the Academia. The representation of fixed objects occupying a space, was replaced by dynamic colors and form in constant evolution. Yet other means would be necessary to jettison completely the long-standing foundation that surrounded them. While the freedom of Impressionism had certainly jeopardized its integrity, it would take another generation of artists, not just to bring the edifice down piece by piece, but to rebuild an entirely new configuration, ''cube by cube''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierot and Harlequin)'', oil on canvas, {{convert|102|x|81|cm|in|abbr=on}}, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Several predominant factors mobilized the shift from a more representational art form to one that would become increasingly abstract; one of the most important would be found directly within the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and exemplified in a widely discussed letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904. Cézanne ambiguously writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, April 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object turns away from the source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

The art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] acknowledged the importance of Cézanne to the Cubists in his article titled ''From Cézanne to Cubism'' (published in ''Eclair'', 1920). For Vauxcelles the influence had a two-fold character, both 'architectural' and 'intellectual'. He stressed the statement made by [[Émile Bernard]] that Cézanne's optics were "not in the eye, but in his brain".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 112.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Paul Cézanne]], ca.1897, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from the Bibémus Quarry'', oil on canvas, 65 x 81 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. In order to express the mountain’s grandeur, Cézanne manipulated the scene by painting the mountain twice as large as it would have appeared, and tipped forward so that it would rise up rather than slope backwards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbma.org/learning%2Dfrom%2Dcezanne/downloads/cezanne%2Dmt%5Fsaint%5Fvictoire.pdf Baltimore Museum of Art, Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from the Bibémus Quarry, c. 1897, by Paul Cézanne]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With both his courage and experience to draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He combined on the one hand the imitative and the ''immobile'', a system left over from the Renaissance, and the ''mobile'' on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde artists in Paris (including [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]) had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which some of these artist made the transition from [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] to [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne syntax didn't just ripple outwards over the sphere, touching those that would become [[Cubism|Cubists]] in France, [[Futurism|Futurists]] in Italy and [[Die Brücke]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] in Germany, it also created currents that flowed throughout Parisian art world threatening to destabilize (if not topple) at least three of the core foundations of the academia: the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance; [[Figurative art|Figuratism]], derived from real object sources (and therefore [[Representation (arts)|representational]]), and [[aesthetics]]. At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, and anything that wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression'', CRCL, 24:3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
In his ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] reviews the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] roots of modern art, exploring the literary source of both [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting in France and [[Futurism]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776441?uid=3737952&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101725009653 Daniel Robbins, ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', Art Journal, Vol. 41, No. 4, (Winter 1981): pp. 324-27], Published by College Art Association&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution of ''free verse'' with which [[Gustave Kahn]] was associated, was a principle example of the correspondence between progress in art and politics; a growing conviction among young artists. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] acknowledged his indebtedness to it, as a source of modern artistic liberty. "[[Paul Fort]]'s Parisian review ''Vers et Prose''", writes Robbins, "as well as the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], cradle of both [[Jules Romain (author)|Jules Romain]]'s [[Unanimism]] and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]'s ''Dramatisme'', had emphasized the importance of this new formal device".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt; Kahn's free verse was revolutionary because, in his own words, "free verse is mobile, like mobile perspective". In classical French poetry, writes Robbins, "meaning and rhythm were united, and sense and rhythm stopped simultaneously. The unity consisted in the number and rhythm of vowels and consonants together forming an organic and independent cell". The system began to break down, according to Kahn, with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets when they permitted a stop for the ear, with ''no'' stop in meaning. This is akin to [[Jacques Villon]]'s drawings and prints of 1908 and 1909, notes Robbins, "where the hatching lines that create a shape do not stop at the contour, but continue beyond, taking on an independent life".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

The next step, wrote Kahn, was to impart unity and cohesion by means of a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the [[strophe]]. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the [[metronome]]-like symmetry and introduced ''liberty'', ''flexibility'' and ''elasticity''. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

''Elasticity'', one of Kahn's favorite words used to describe free verse, would become the title of well known Futurist works by [[Umberto Boccioni]], as well as two paintings by [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], a proto-Cubist work and later a cubist work entitled ''Marie Ressort'' (''ressort'' meaning elasticity or spring). These paintings, writes Robbins, are an homage to the prose of [[Jules Laforgue]], whose poems concerned the life of his sister Marie.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

====Pablo Picasso====
{{double image|right|El Greco, c.1609-14, The Vision of Saint John, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|190|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|210|[[El Greco]], ''[[The Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (c.1609–14, oil, 224.8 × 199.4&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) has been suggested to be the prime source of inspiration for Picasso's {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}}.|Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907, oil on canvas, 243.9&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;233.7&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]) appears to have certain morphological and stylistic similarities with ''The Opening of the Fifth Seal''.||}}
In 1899 Picasso rejected academic study and joined a circle of avant-garde artists and writers known as ''[[Modernisme|modernistes]]'' or ''decadentes''. Meeting at [[Els Quatre Gats]] in [[Barcelona]], they assimilated trends such as symbolism and [[Art nouveau]], characterized by contour lines, simplified form and unnatural colors. Yet, in addition to the influence of [[Théophile Steinlen]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], that of [[Francisco Goya]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm Goya and Modernism, Bienal Internacional de São Paulo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117072537/http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm |date=2008-01-17 }} Retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[El Greco]] can be seen in Picasso's work of the period. A significant innovation of El Greco's later works is the interweaving of form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two that unifies the painted surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref name="Lambraki57-59"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco'', 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting these style, the artist produced numerous portraits of friends such as [[Carlos Casagemas]] and [[Jaime Sabartes|Jaime Sabartès]] (Sabartès Seated). The modernists also devoted themselves to political anarchy and other social causes, including sympathy for the poor, denizens and the underclass; subjects that would soon emerge in the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]] (a color associated with despair and melancholy, blue was commonly used in Symbolist painting).&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/picasso.pdf ''Picasso: The Early Years, 1892-1906'', National Gallery of Art (NGA), Washington DC, Exhibition catalogue, March 30 - July 27, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

This work has a striking resemblance to 20th-century [[Expressionism]]. Historically however it is an example of [[Mannerism]].]]
The first artist who seems to have noticed the structural code built into the morphology of late El Greco was [[Paul Cézanne]], one of the forerunners of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Plaka49"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco—The Greek'', 49&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters works reveal common elements: the distortion of the human body, the reddish and unworked backgrounds, and the similarities in the rendering of space.&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki105-106"&gt;E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them".&lt;ref name="Brown28"&gt;J. Brown, ''El Greco of Toledo'', 28&lt;/ref&gt; Fry observed that Cézanne drew from "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".&lt;ref name="Lambraki15"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Picasso moved to Paris, where the work of post-impressionist painters Van Gogh, Cézanne, Seurat, Gauguin were exhibited at galleries and Salons. Rapidly assimilating these influences, he adapted to new styles and techniques, as the use of bright unmixed colors.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

The [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] during his [[Blue Period]], drew on the cool tonality of El Greco and the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on {{lang|fr|[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]}}, he visited his friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] in his Parisian atelier and studied El Greco's ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (owned by Zuloaga since 1897).&lt;ref&gt;Carter .B. Horsley, [http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html ''The Shock of the Old''], El Greco at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art. Accessed 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}} and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed. Art historian Ron Johnson was the first to focus on the relationship between the two paintings. According to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' "turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as [[Cézanne]]".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;R. Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon'', 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Picasso's Rose Period]] turns toward the theme of the fairground and circus performers; subjects often depicted in [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]], [[Romanticism|romantic]] and symbolist art and verse (from Baudelaire and Rimbaud to Daumier and Seurat), where melancholy and social alienation pervade the saltimbanque. Corresponding to the tone of Picasso, acrobats represent both mystery and enchantment in the poems of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] written in the same period.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

In 1906, working at the Bateau Lavoir, Picasso continued to explore new directions; portraying monumental female figures standing in abstract interior spaces. Now, in addition to the bathers of Cézanne, Spanish romanesque art and Iberian sculpture provide a prominent influences for Picasso. Around this time he also created a self-portrait depicting himself as something of a latter-day Cézanne.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

====Albert Gleizes====
[[File:L'Abbaye de Créteil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Abbaye de Créteil]], ca.1908. First row: Charles Vildrac, René Arcos, Albert Gleizes, Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau. Second row: Georges Duhamel, Berthold Mahn, d'Otémar]]
The proto-Cubism of [[Albert Gleizes]] too bares its roots in Symbolism. In his father's Montmartre workshop (around 1899), Gleizes joins a childhood friend, the poet [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Amiens (1904) he meets the painters [[:fr:Berthold Mahn|Berthold Mahn]], Jacques d'Otémar and Josué Gaboriaud, as well as the printer, Lucien Linard, who will soon run the printshop at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]. At the same time, through Jean Valmy Baysse, an art critic (and soon historian of the [[Comédie-Française]]) who was a friend of the Gleizes family, René Arcos is invited to participate on a new journal, ''La Vie'', in collaboration with [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Georges Duhamel]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1905 the group of writers and painters is joined by the Symbolist poet and writer [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]. Gleizes is instrumental in forming the Association [[Ernest Renan]], launched in December at the [[Théâtre Pigalle]], with the aim of countering the influence of militarist propaganda while providing the elements of a popular and secular culture. Gleizes is responsible for the ''Literary'' and ''Artistic'' section which organises street theatre and poetry readings.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Throughout 1906, Gleizes and his associates pursue an idea proposed by Charles Vildrac of establishing of a self-supporting artists community which would enable them to develop their art free of commercial considerations. A suitable house and grounds is found in Créteil, then a small village outside Paris. The rent for the first six months is provided by Barzun through a small inheritance. In December, Gleizes and Vildrac move in.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] consists of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel himself, like Barzun, appears intermittently. The group is joined by the musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''Fêtes du Peuple''. [[Alexandre Mercereau]] arrives in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife who speaks no French. The group supports itself through the fine quality printing run by Linard and Gleizes. Occasional visitors include the painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1909, Bords de la Marne, oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon..jpg|thumb|250px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1909, ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]'', oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]
The poets of the Abbaye, Arcos, Duhamel and Barzun, develop a distinctive style dealing in ''free verse'', with epic subjects influenced by [[Walt Whitman]], [[Emil Verhaeren]] and, especially, the French epic Symbolist poet [[:fr:René Ghil|René Ghil]]. Ghil developed his ideas on language, at first, in close relation with Symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. Ghil held open evenings every Friday, attended by the members of the Abbaye.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The Abbaye published books by a wide variety of authors including [[:fr:Robert de Montesqiou|Robert de Montesqiou]], model for the Duc de Charlus in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A la recherche de temps perdu'', the Polish anarchist and art theorist [[:fr:Mecislas Goldberg|Mecislas Goldberg]], and the well-known collection of poems ''La Vie Unanime'', by [[Jules Romains]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; ''La Vie Unanime'' was the result of a vision Romains had in 1903, writes Peter Brooke, "in which he had seen all the phenomena of daily life as intimately related like the different parts of a single huge beast". On the strength of its association with Romains the Abbaye de Créteil is often described as 'Unanimist'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
 
During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organise a great ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, soon to be the theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Gleizes' own painting in this period shifts from Post-Impressionism towards a fluid, linear style, with close relations to Symbolism and [[Les Nabis]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

When the Abbaye closed in January 1908, Gleizes moved into a studio situated in [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], rue du Delta, with his friend the painter and poet [[:fr:Henri Doucet|Henri Doucet]]. Though his subject matter is always taken from an unsentimental observation of the world, writes Brooke, 'Gleizes has a marked preference for urban and semi-urban scenes with an emphasis on human labour'. Though he often uses bright colors there is little or no interest in either Fauvism or Divisionism, the two schools that now dominate the Parisian [[Avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1909 Gleizes' evolution towards a more linear proto-Cubist style continues with greater emphasis on clear, simplified, construction; ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]''. At the [[Salon d'Automne]] Gleizes is impressed by the work of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], especially his portrait of the poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]]. Le Fauconnier's portraits and his landscapes painted in Brittany (''[[:fr:Ploumanac'h|Ploumanac'h]]'') show the intention of simplifying form similar to that of Gleizes. The two painters meet through the intermediary of Alexandre Mercereau.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Gleizes exhibits his proto-Cubist works ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'' at the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form clearly overwhelms the representational aspect of the works. The same tendency is evident in [[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited at the same Salon. In his ''Anecdotiques'', 16 October 1911, Apollinaire writes: "I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants."&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1132933/f46.image Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Anecdotiques'', Jean Metzinger, ''Portrait of Apollinaire'', 16 October, 1911, p. 44], Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Jean Metzinger, 1910, ''Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire'', Christie's Paris, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes and Metzinger become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1905-1906 [[Fauvism|Fauvist]]-[[Divisionism|divisionist]] technique, too, had its parallel in literature. For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's early work, proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], but beyond too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gino Severini, 1911, La Danseuse Obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin), oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection.jpg|thumb|[[Gino Severini]], 1911, ''La danseuse obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin)'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection]]
An interpretation of this statement was made by Robert L. Herbert: "What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement." (Herbert, 1968)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

During Metzinger's [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] period (see ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'', 1905–06), each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Impressionism===
[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906-07, ''Paysage au disque'', oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Musée national d'art moderne (MNAM), [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
"Artists of the years 1910-1914, including Mondrian and Kandinsky as well as the Cubists", writes Robert Herbert, "took support from one of its central principles: that line and color have the ability to communicate certain emotions to the observer, independently of natural form." He continues, "Neo-Impressionist color theory had an important heir in the person of Robert Delaunay. He had been a Neo-Impressionist in the Fauve period, and knew intimately the writings of Signac and Henry. His famous solar discs of 1912 and 1913 are descended from the Neo-Impressionists' concentration upon the decomposition of spectral light."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The height of Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay painted portraits of one another in prominent rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'', 1906–1907 (Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'', "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..." (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil No. 1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204851/http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together in 1906 and 1907—would develop a new style of Neo-Impressionism incorporating large cubic brushstrokes within highly geometrized compositions that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Both [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo-Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The [[Futurists]] later (1911–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;
 
"The Neo-Impressionists" according to Maurice Denis, "inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes, of the changes occurring in the early 20th century: "By about 1904, the resolution of the dilemma was made in favor of the abstract side of the equation. "Harmony means sacrifice", Cross said, and much of early Neo-Impressionism was jettisoned. Although they paid lip service to their established theory, Signac and Cross now painted in enormous strokes which could never pretend to mix in the eye, and which did not even retain nuance of tone. Raw, bold yellows, magentas, reds, blues, and greens sprang forth from their canvases, making them as free of the trammels of nature as any painting then being done in Europe."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Where the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, 1889-90, Le Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georges Seurat]], 1889-90, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', oil on canvas, 171.5 x 140.5 cm (66 7/8 x 54 3/4 in), [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], [[Netherlands]]]]
"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911," Herbert continues, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon "one of the great icons of the new devotion", and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], "almost belong to Synthetic Cubism".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics ([[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]) would do so with color too.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

With the exception of Picasso (his Blue and Pink periods being entirely different intellectually), all the leading Cubists and Futurists came from Neo-Impressionism, believing its objective validity to be a scientific discovery. It was in part this scientific basis that left the avant-garde artists vulnerable to the critique of scientific objectivity, of the type developed first by [[Immanuel Kant]], then [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and of course [[Albert Einstein]]; in relation to, for example, the treatment of time as the fourth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/othertxts/miller Peter Brooke, ''Letter to Arthur Miller'', A commentary on Arthur Miller's ''Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the beauty that causes havoc'', Basic Books, New York, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===African, Egyptian, Greek, Iberian &amp; Oceanic art===
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]
Another factor in the shift towards abstraction could be found burgeoning in art circles during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Europeans were discovering [[Prehistoric art]], along with art produced by a variety of cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]]. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Rousseau]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of those cultures.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up ''The Cubist Epoch''], London: Phaidon in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art &amp; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1970. {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[Tribal art]], [[Iberian sculpture]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications and expressive features, is another generally assumed starting point for the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. [[Pierre Daix]], explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. Without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism—coming as it did not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche—clairvoyantly (as Rimbaud would have said) arrived at the suprapersonal and thereby borders on the archaic mythological consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W09TW-75Be0C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0lE4CdAuFA&amp;sig=BS3eQQafhGRg3p46AVQc3YjAMfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r48qUevONcLRhAfZyYH4Dw&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;f=false Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Pierre+Daix,+rimbaud,+picasso,+conscience+mythologie+archaïques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2gmkbih4Ru&amp;sig=MgG93AripQUGLBdWvvcYc69dIiI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ldAsUbGDFIeS0QWHq4HYBQ&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pierre%20Daix%2C%20rimbaud%2C%20picasso%2C%20conscience%20mythologie%20archaïques&amp;f=false Anatoli Podoksik, Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011], {{ISBN|978-1-78042-285-5}} (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists (and art collectors) prized these objects for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N. Broude and M. Garrard (Eds.). New York: Harper Collins, 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted the Parisian avant-garde.

[[File:Paul Gauguin, 1894, Oviri (Sauvage), partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Gauguin]], 1894, ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri (Sauvage)]]'', partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris]]
The works of [[Paul Gauguin]] had achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1903 and 1906. Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly influenced by the paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his [[Work of art|oeuvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Sweetman"&gt;David Sweetman, ''Paul Gauguin, A life'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80941-9}}, 562-563&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,
:"The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor."&lt;ref&gt;John A. Richardson, ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26665-1}}, 1991, 461&lt;/ref&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin's ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes, "Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''."&lt;ref name="Sweetman" /&gt;

Many artists associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] transited through a proto-Cubist period, while some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others chose different paths. And not all underwent the transformation by passing through the [[Primitivism|Primitivist]] phase.

====Chronophotography====
[[File:Kiss, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|left|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Kiss'', animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444]]
The [[Chronophotography]] of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] had a profound influence on the beginnings of Cubism and Futurism. These photographic motion studies particularly interested artists that would later form a groups known as the [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]] and [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, chronophotography involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These studies would directly influence [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2|Nu descendant un escalier n° 2]]''&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin (1996). Duchamp: A Biography. U.S.: Henry Holt and Company, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could also be read into Metzinger's work of 1910-12, though rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict the motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest viewed from multiple angles; the dynamic role is played by the artist rather than the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/marey/?do=fic&amp;idn=P345 Étienne-Jules Marey, ''La Science du mouvement et l'image du temps''], (The Science of mouvement and the image of time)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eadweard Muybridge's sequential photography of movements broken down frame by frame produced in the late 19th century depicting a wide variety of subjects in motion, were known in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the subject is captured in split-second intervals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Helios.html?id=bwBMAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, ''Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change'', Corcoran Gallery of Art] in Washington, DC, 2010 {{ISBN|978-3-86521-926-8}} (Steidl).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125899013/muybridge-the-man-who-made-pictures-move [[Neda Ulaby]], ''Muybridge: The Man Who Made Pictures Move'', 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Eadweard_Muybridge.html?id=VIUaQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, with contributions by Marta Braun, Andy Grundberg, Corey Keller and Rebecca Solnit, ''Eadweard Muybridge'', San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Pub., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his work and its relation to the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me. The fact that I had seen chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me the idea for the ''Nude''. It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice.

Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, capturing the interest of artists at home and abroad. In 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, learning about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative, while Muybridge used multiple cameras to produce separate images that could be projected by his zoopraxiscope.&lt;ref name=Brookman&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=93|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, Muybridge's photos were published as a massive portfolio comprising 781 plates and 20,000 photographs in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.&lt;ref name=UPennArchive&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] "The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later work, Muybridge was influenced by, and in turn influenced the French photographer [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.&lt;ref name=Brookman91&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=91|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple exposure sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called "Marey wheel" camera.

[[File:Marey- Man walking, 1890–91.jpg|thumb|left|[[Étienne-Jules Marey]], 1890–91, ''Homme qui marche (Man Walking)'', [[Chronophotography]]]]
While Marey's scientific achievements in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]] are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic than scientific.&lt;ref name=Adam14&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam, (ed.)|first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783836509411|page=14|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled extensively, giving numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the "Science of Animal Locomotion" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public, making the Hall the first commercial [[movie theater]].&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite book| last = Clegg| first = Brian| title = The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher = [[Joseph Henry Press]]| year = 2007| isbn = 0-309-10112-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marey also made movies. His chronophotographic gun (1882) was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, and the most interesting fact is that all the frames were recorded on the same picture. Using these pictures he studied a great variety of animals. Some call it Marey’s "animated zoo". Marey also studied human [[animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He published several books including ''Le Mouvement'' in 1894.

His movies were at a high speed of 60 images per second and of excellent image quality: coming close to perfection in slow-motion cinematography. His research on how to capture and display moving images helped the emerging field of [[cinematography]].

Towards the turn of the century he returned to studying the movement of quite abstract forms, like a falling ball. His last great work, executed just before the outbreak of Fauvism in Paris, was the observation and photography of smoke trails. This research was partially funded by [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], after the two met in [[Paris]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]].

====Philosophical, scientific and social motivations====
To justify such a radical move towards the depiction of the world in unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William James]] and the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]]'s [[X-ray]]s, [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertzian]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[radio waves]] propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of [[sensory perception]]. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gregory, "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp. 598–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Linda D. Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art'', Princeton University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1881 and 1882 Poincaré wrote a series of works titled ''On curves defined by differential equations'' within which he built a new branch of mathematics called "qualitative theory of differential equations". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found (from the very form of the equation). He investigated the nature of trajectories of integral curves in a plane; classifying singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introducing the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{ISBN|978-3764358457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Poincaré, following [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and others, viewed geometric models as mere conventions rather than as absolute. [[Euclidean geometry]], upon which traditional [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery in the world of mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

Pictorial space could now be transformed in response to the artists own subjectivity (expressing primal impulses, irrespective of classical perspective and Beaux Arts artistic expectations). "Adherence to subjectivity in turn" write Antliff and Leighten, "signalled a radical break from past pictorial conventions in favour of a Nietzschean expression of individual will".&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;

Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[Maurice Princet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time, and the Beauty That Causes Havoc |year=2001 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=0-465-01860-2 |pages=171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[mathematician]] and [[actuary]] who played a role in the birth of [[Cubism]]. An associate of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Juan Gris]] and later [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet became known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=100 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }} Miller cites:

[[File:Jouffret.gif|right|thumb|An illustration from Jouffret's ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions''. The book, which influenced Picasso, was given to him by Princet.]]
Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to artists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princet brought to the attention of Picasso, Metzinger and others, a book by [[Esprit Jouffret]], ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/traitlmentaired00joufgoog/page/n9 Jouffret, Esprit, ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions''], 1903, (in French) archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional surface. Picasso's sketchbooks for ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=106–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Princet's wife left him for [[André Derain]], and he drifted away from the circle of artists at the Bateau-Lavoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Robbin |title=Shadows of Reality, The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-11039-1 |pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Princet remained close to Metzinger and would soon participate in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the group, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet's influence on the Cubists was attested to by [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]: "I witnessed the birth of cubism, its growth, its decline. Picasso was the obstetrician, Guillaume Apollinaire the midwife, Princet the godfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlaminck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice de Vlaminck |date=June 6, 1942 |title=Opinions libres... sur la peinture |journal=Comédia |pages=1, 6 |quote=J'ai assisté à la naissance du cubisme, à sa croissance, à son déclin.

[[Louis Vauxcelles]] along similar lines dubbed Princet, sarcastically, the 'father of Cubism': "M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak rather carelessly. Now then, M. Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious M. Picasso of it, and M. Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. M. Picasso explained his intentions to M. Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vauxcelles |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Vauxcelles |date=December 29, 1918 |title=Le Carnet des ateliers: La Père du cubisme |journal=Le Carnet de la semaine |pages=11 }} in {{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Linda Dalrymple |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-10142-6 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, in 1910, wrote of Princet: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |location=Paris |isbn= |pages=43–44 }} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Bergson, James, Stein====
The nineteenth-century positivists concept of measurable deterministic time became untenable as [[Henri Bergson]] exposed his radical idea that the human experience of time was a creative process associated with biological evolution. He rejected the division of space into separate measurable units. Both Bergson and [[William James]] described the intellect as an instrumental tool, a by-product of evolution. The intellect was no longer considered a cognitive faculty able to grasp reality in an impartial manner. Instead, argued Bergson, we should rely on intuition to inspired creative insights in both the sciences and the arts. His third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907, constituting one of the most profound and original contributions to the philosophical consideration of evolution. The proto-Cubists would have known of his work through, amongst others, [[Gertrude Stein]] a student of William James. Stein had recently purchased, following the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]] (La femme au chapeau)''&lt;ref&gt;Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat'' is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.&lt;ref&gt;Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8. The painting now in a private collection was displayed in a 2003 Matisse/Picasso exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt; With James's supervision, Stein and fellow student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on ''normal motor automatism'', a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking, yielding examples of writing that appeared to represent "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Has Gertrude Stein a Secret?"

Disposed to accept the unorthodox in life and art, and naturally tolerant of eccentricity, Gertrude Stein had accommodated the tendency of her Parisian contemporaries of spend their time and talent looking for ways to [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]. According to the American poet and literary critic [[John Malcolm Brinnin]], this was "a society committed to the systematic outraging of every rule".&lt;ref name="Brinnin"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thirdrose030726mbp John Malcolm Brinnin, ''The Third Rose, Gertrude Stein and Her World'', An Atlantic Monthly Press Book, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, Toronto, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso's famous dinner party for [[Henri Rousseau|Le Douanier Rousseau]] was an eye-opening event in the proto-Cubist period. ''Le Banquet Rousseau'', "one of the most notable social events of the twentieth century", writes Brinnin, "was neither an orgiastic occasion nor even an opulent one. Its subsequent fame grew from the fact that it was a colorful happening within a revolutionary art movement at a point of that movement's earliest success, and from the fact that it was attended by individuals whose separate influences radiated like spokes of creative light across the art world for generations."&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

[[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], in ''Les Soires de Paris'', 15 January 1914, p.&amp;nbsp;69, wrote about "Le Banquet Rousseau".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQUeVH8Sh4oC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=André+Salmon,+%22banquet+Rousseau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ievCA-jlLA&amp;sig=WaLalYMO1ksgzL1xbpL6yvyTghw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W6wvUc6VFMjV0QXysICwDA&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=banquet%20Rousseau&amp;f=false Ann Temkin, ''Rousseau: The Dream'', The Museum of Modern Art, July 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Years later the French writer [[André Salmon]] recalled the setting of the illustrious banquet; Picasso's studio at [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]]:

:"Here the nights of the Blue Period passed... here the days of the Rose Period flowered... here the Demoiselles d'Avignon halted in their dance to re-group themselves in accordance with the golden number and the secret of the fourth dimension... here fraternized the poets elevated by serious criticism into the School of the Rue Ravignan... here in these shadowy corridors lived the true worshippers of fire ... here one evening in the year 1908 unrolled the pageantry of the first and last banquet offered by his admirers to the painter Henri Rousseau called the Douanier."&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

Guests at the ''banquet Rousseau'' of 1908, in addition to Picasso and the guest of honor, included [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]], [[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], [[Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler]], [[Leo Stein]] and [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;

No observer, either academic or independent, could have mistaken the direction of change taken by the avant-garde between 1906 and 1910. The fundamental shift away from nature within artistic circles had advanced to the status of ''revolt'', in far-reaching ways, diverging significantly from the developments of Cézanne or Seurat. The symptoms of that shift during the first decade of the 20th century are countless and redoubtable, bursting practically overnight, and were soon to be perceived by the reactionary adversaries as no more than grotesque, incomprehensible, to be considered with haughty amusement.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

==The Wild Men of Paris==
Leading up to 1910, one year before the scandalous group exhibiting that brought "Cubism" to the attention of the general public for the first time, the draftsman, illustrator and poet, [[Gelett Burgess]], interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. After his visit to the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], the well-established anti-establishment art exhibition at this time peppered with proto-Cubist works, he wrote in humorist fashion:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, Wild Men of Paris, The Architectural Record, May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees...

''Blue Nude'' would later create a sensation at the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/11/the-response-to-matisses-blue-nude/ Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes, ''The Response to Matisse's Blue Nude'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet.

The dance theme passed through several stages in Matisse's work prior to this canvas. Only here, however, did it acquire its famous passion and expressive resonance. The frenzy of the pagan bacchanalia is embodied in the powerful, stunning accord of red, blue and green, uniting Man, Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;Query_Exp=%28WOA_TYPE+%3D%3D+%22Painting%22%29+AND+%28WOA_AUTHOR+%3D%3D+%22Matisse%2C+Henri%22%29&amp;PID=GJ-9673&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=8&amp;thumbFile=%2Ftmplobs%2FD2IQ47M%24BWXA34AL6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=noEmb&amp;comeFrom=browse&amp;check=false&amp;sorting=WOA_AUTHOR%5EWOA_NAME&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=38&amp;author=Matisse%2C%26%2332%3BHenri Henri Matisse, 1909-10, ''The Dance'', Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burgess, turning his attention to Metzinger, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the "need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. "Quite clearly" Metzinger notes, "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common..." Already, in 1906, "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Picasso... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the "entirely intuitive dissociation" between color of the Fauves and form of classical painting, exemplified in the works of [[Raoul Dufy]] (who paints first, then draws), "foreshadowed, more perhaps than Cézanne or black African art, not just Cubism but all the painting that followed afterward".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, "the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age."&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Jean Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] between 1905 and 1907 painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or rectangular planes of color (see Metzinger's ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'' and ''[[La danse, Bacchante]]''). The size and direction of each plane are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting, yet color can vary independently of size and placement. This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]]. Writing in 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] pointed out in his Gleizes Guggenheim catalogue, used the word "cube" which would later be taken up by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: 
:"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent: ''Les Artistes indépendantes'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

The history of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing Cross's Neo-Impressionist work at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'' commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

During the month of March, 1905, Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the Salon des Indépendants, published on the front page of Gil Blas, writes: "M. Metzinger, still very young, mimics his elders with the candor of a child throwing handfuls of multicolored confetti; his « point », very big, gives his paintings the appearance of a mosaic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7528616k/f1.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'' (front page article), Gil Blas, No. 9295, A27, 23 March 1905], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger formed a close friendship with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anonymous review of the 1908 Salon des Indépendants published in Le Matin, Metzinger is accused of making "a salad of Maurice Denis and Egyptian bas-reliefs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5686418/f2.image Salon des Indépendants, Le Matin, Numéro 8788, 20 March 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Vauxcelles again, in his review of [[Georges Braque]]'s exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7521008s/f2.item Louis Vauxcelles, Exposition Braques, Gil Blas, 14 November 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danchev"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vauxcelles recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 Salon d'Automne] a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse's words and spoke of Braque's little cubes. The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Futurism in Paris - The Avant-garde Explosion'', Pompidou Center, Paris 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1909, Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, this time in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants, published 19 March 1910 in Le Petit Parisien, art critic Jean Claude pejoratively combined the terms "Metzinger-le-cubique".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563551x/f2.image Jean Claude, La Vie Artistique, ''Au Salon des Indépendants'', Le Petit Parisien, Numéro 12194, 19 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso's works are exhibited at a small gallery run by the German collector-dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]] in May 1910 (cited in Fry 58 and Robbins 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 22). The exhibition is reviewed by Léon Werth, who used the adjective 'cubic' to describe Picasso's treatment of roofs and chimneys.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne published in L'Ouest-Éclair, a journalist (J.B.) employs the term 'Cubism' demeaningly (several months prior to the popularization of the term):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now a note on the grotesque: Among all these "fauves"—the name given to the Impressionists in conventional workshops—the most "fauve" of all is certainly Jean Metzinger, the defender of ''Cubism''. Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how "Cubism" proceeds. Under the title of ''Nu'' [''Nude''], Jean Metzinger shows us "cubes" of various tones, but of the same color. The trick is to find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art. This is the latest cry of pictorial craziness [''loufoquerie picturale''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6426734/f2.image ''Le Salon d'Automne, La Bretagne et les Peinture Bretonnes'', L'Ouest-Éclair (Rennes), 5 October 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne, published in ''La Presse'', art critique Edmond Epardaud writes of the 'geometric follies' of Metzinger, and describes both Gleizes and Le Fauconnier as 'specious architects' (''architectes fallacieux'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k596525z/f2.image Edmond Epardaud, ''On Inaugure demain le Salon d'Automne'', La Presse, 30 September 1910, Numéro 6675, pp. 1, 2], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Jean Claude writes in his review of the same salon, with reference to Metzinger's ''[[Nu à la cheminée]]'', published in ''Le Petit Parisien'', "Metzinger painted a puzzle, cubic and triangular, which after verification, is a naked woman. I managed to discover the head, torso and legs. I had to give up finding arms. This is beyond comprehension".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563747g/f5.image Jean Claude, ''Grand Palais, Le Salon d'Automne'', Le Petit Parisien, 2 October 1910, Numéro 12391, p. 5], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cézanne was "the point of departure for these mad explorers," [[Gelett Burgess]] writes, "It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly." Picasso, at the time, painted a nude woman "composed entirely of triangles". Braque "builds an architectural monster which he names woman". Braque was, according to Burgess, "the originator of architectural nudes with square feet, as square as boxes, with right-angled shoulders". Derain, "a co-experimenter," writes Burgess, "moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;

In his 1912 ''Anecdotal History of Cubism'' [[André Salmon]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay painted landscapes planted with cottages reduced to the severe appearance of [[parallelepiped]]s. Living less of an interior life than Picasso, remaining to all outward appearances more like painters than their precursor, these young artists were in a much greater hurry for results, though they be less complete. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exhibited, their works passed almost unobserved by the public and by art critics, who...recognized only the Fauves, whether it be to praise or to curse to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the king of the Fauves... Henri Matisse... with one word cast out Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay from the family. With that feminine sense of the appropriate, the basis of his taste, he baptized the cottages of the two painters, "Cubist." An ingenuous or ingenious art critic was with him. He ran to his newspaper and with style wrote the gospel article; the next day the public learned of the birth of Cubism.

The word "cube" for Chassevent in 1906, with regard to the large, thickly painted, and highly geometrized paintings of Metzinger and Delaunay, did not imply a movement. Nor did the word "cube" for Vauxcelles hold any special meaning two and a half years later when he wrote (in November 1908) a brief passage about Braque's landscapes exhibited at the Kahnweiler gallery: "He scorns forms, reduces all sites and figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes":&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

:"In neither case" notes Daniel Robbins, "did the use of the word "cube" lead to the immediate identification of the artists with a new pictorial attitude, with a movement. The word was no more than an isolated descriptive epithet that, in both cases, was prompted by a visible passion for structure so assertive that the critics were wrenched, momentarily, from their habitual concentration on motifs and subjects, in which context their comments on drawing, color, tonality, and, only occasionally, conception, resided." (Robbins, 1985)&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In light of the headway made by Cézanne, the multiple use of the word "cube" with reference to diverse works by diverse artists, and the other factors involved (political, social, cultural), it has been suggested that Cubism, with its proto-phase, would have emerged regardless of Picasso's intervention. The art historian and collector Douglas Cooper viewed Cubist painting to have been the beginning of a stylistic revolution which was inevitable. The American art scholar and MoMA curator [[William Rubin]] argued that Braque, with his commitment to a Cézannist syntax, would have created early Cubism had Picasso never existed.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=revolution%20that%20was%20inevitable&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'' or ''Brick factory at Tortosa'', as the first Cubist paintings.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

According to the personal predilections of Kahnweiler, Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] was the beginning of Cubism, and yet he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once. (Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, The rise of cubism (Der Weg zum Kubismus)'', New York, Wittenborn, Schultz. This is the first translation of the original German text entitled "Der Weg zum Kubismus", Munich, Delphin-Verlag, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
And Cottington following through notes that "the problems were quite unrelated, however, to the picture's subject of an encounter with five naked staring whores (even though Kahnweiler's choice of adjectives seems to have registered its affect)".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These problems were the basic tasks of painting: to represent three dimensions and color on a flat surface, and to comprehend them in the unity of that surface... Not the simulation of form by chiaroscuro, but the depiction of the three dimensional through drawing on a flat surface...(Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahnweiler's conclusion, similar to those leveled against Cézanne, was that Picasso's painting 'never constitutes a unified whole' and was thus unsuccessful. "After months of the most laborious searching, notes Kahnweiler, "Picasso realized that the complete solution of the problem did not lie in this direction".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt; In July 1916, ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time, and not in the gallery of Kahnweiler. It was included in the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by [[André Salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Billy Klüver, ''A Day with Picasso'', The MIT Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-262-61147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bypassing the problem of color, simply by eliminating color from his paintings, Picasso in 1908 concentrated on form. Kahnweiler notes:

:"Thus Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures, and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne. Light is never more than a means to create form — through chiaroscuro, since he did not at this time repeat the unsuccessful attempt of 1907 to create form through drawing."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

"Derain, too, had abandoned decorative light painting in 1907", Kahnweiler writes, "preceding Braque by a few months. But from the outset, their roads were diverse. Derain's endeavor to retain fidelity to nature in his painting separates him forever from Cubism, no matter how closely his ideas may otherwise parallel those of Braque."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

[[File:Othon Friesz, 1907-08, Le Travail à l'Automne, oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Othon Friesz]], 1907-08, ''Le Travail à l'Automne'', oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo]]
And Derain was not the only one to venture along the path of Cézanne, only to turn away from it in the coming years. Chagall, Friesz, Matisse, Dufy, Redon, Vlaminck and Modigliani are prime examples.

But too, just as Picasso and Braque, other artists independently and simultaneously explored the Cézannian approach, and did continue on to become Cubists, each with his or her own particular style.

==The sequence of events==
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was practically over by the spring of the 1907 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. And by the [[Salon d'Automne]] in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].

===1907===
* The 1907 Salon d'Automne impels Apollinaire to refer to Matisse as the "fauve of fauves". Works by both Derain and Matisse are criticized for the ugliness of their models. Braque and Le Fauconnier are considered as Fauves by the critic Michel Puy (brother of [[Jean Puy]]).&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt; Robert Delaunay showed one work, [[André Lhote]] showed three, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] three, [[Jean Crotti]] one, [[Fernand Léger]] five, [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] two, [[Raoul Dufy]] three, [[André Derain]] exhibited three paintings and [[Henri Matisse]] seven works.&lt;ref name="Salon 1907"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cataloguedesouvr00salo Salon d'automne; Société du Salon d'automne], Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art décoratif. Exposés au Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
* Metzinger and Delaunay are singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

===1908===
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Henri Le Fauconnier]], 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands]]
* At the Indépendants of 1908, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908), Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'...&amp;nbsp;who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* An exhibition at Galerie Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) includes [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;MAM, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris 1937, L'Art Indépendant, ex. cat. {{ISBN|2-85346-044-4}}, Paris-Musées, 1987, P. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 continues with the ''Salon de la Toison d'Or'', Moscow: Braque, Derain, Metzinger, van Dongen, Friesz, Manguin, Marquet, Matisse, Puy, Valtat and others exhibit. At the 1909 Salon d’Automne, [[Constantin Brâncuși]] exhibits with [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]] and Jean Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

* Six landscapes painted at L'Estaque signed Georges Braque were presented to the Jury of the [[Salon d'Automne]]: Guérin, Marquet, Rouault and Matisse rejected Braque's entire submission. Guérin and Marquet elected to keep two in play. Braque withdrew the two in protest, placing the blame on Matisse. [[Louis Vauxcelles]] recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1909, Autoportrait, Self-portrait, oil on canvas, 73 x 59.4 cm, 28 3-4 x 23.3-8, MNAM, Pompidou Paris.png|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1909, ''Autoportrait (Self portrait)'', oil on canvas, 73 × 59.4 cm (28 3/4 × 23 3/8 in), MNAM, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
It is not known to which painting Matisse had referred, but it has been speculated to be ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]'' (1908),&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; a prototypical proto-Cubist period painting consisting both of Cézannian trees and houses depicted in the absence of any unifying perspective. Houses in the background do, however, appear smaller than those of the foreground, consistent with classical perspective.

* Following the rejection of Braque's paintings, Kahnweiler offers the artist a [[one-person show]] at his claustrophobic gallery on a small street situated behind [[La Madeleine, Paris]]. Apollinaire writes of the paintings exhibited nothing about cubes, but mentions "the synthetic motifs he paints" and that he "no longer owes anything to his surroundings". It was Vauxcelles who called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

===1909===
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

* At the 1909 Automne, [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] exhibited a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] portrait of the French writer, novelist and poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]], drawing the attention of [[Albert Gleizes]] who had been working in a similar geometric style.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin Brâncuși exhibited alongside Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* The evolution towards a more rectilinear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from the works of Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

===1910===
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909-10, ''Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)'', oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, [[Tate Modern]], London. This painting from the collection of [[Wilhelm Uhde]] was confiscated by the French state and sold at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921]]
* At the 1910 Salon des Indépendants [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibits ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the "first Cubist portrait (a portrait of myself)".&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques" /&gt; Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S.

Read, University of California Press, 1 October 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Metzinger, the same year, managed to convince the jury of the Salon d'Automne to admit some highly geometric paintings into the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

According to Robert Delaunay himself, the ''Salle II'' of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants was "the first collective manifestation of a new art [un art naissant]".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987 p. 314, note 51&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the Salon d'Automne of 1910, held from 1 October to 8 November, Jean Metzinger introduced an extreme form of what would soon be labeled Cubism, not just to the general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's ''Nude'' represented a radical departure further still.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have in front of me a small cutting from an evening newspaper, ''The Press'', on the subject of the 1910 Salon d'Automne. It gives a good idea of the situation in which the new pictorial tendency, still barely perceptible, found itself: ''The geometrical fallacies of Messrs. Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, and Gleizes''. No sign of any compromise there. Braque and Picasso only showed in Kahnweiler's gallery and we were unaware of them. Robert Delaunay, Metzinger and Le Fauconnier had been noticed at the Salon des Indépendants of that same year, 1910, without a label being fixed on them. Consequently, although much effort has been put into proving the opposite, the word ''Cubism'' was not at that time current. (Albert Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', translation by Peter Brooke. Originally written by Gleizes in 1925 and published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in a series called ''Bauhausbücher'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review of the Salon, the poet [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] (1885-1961) announces the appearance of a new school of French painters concentrating their attention on form rather than on color. A group forms that includes Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger), and Fernand Léger. They meet regularly at Henri Le Fauconnier's studio near the Bld de Montparnasse, where he is working on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. "In this painting" writes Brooke, "the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements".&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

This exhibition preceded the 1911 Salon des Indépendants which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement. Metzinger had been close to Picasso and Braque, working at this time along similar lines.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited coincidentally in Room VIII. This was the moment in which the Montparnasse group quickly grew to include [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]. The three Duchamp brothers, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], and another artist known as [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] took part in the exhibition.

* Following this salon Metzinger writes the article ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51, reprinted in Edward Fry ''Cubism'', London, 1966. Quotation of the original French have been translated by Daniel Robbins&lt;/ref&gt; in which he compares the similarities in the works Picasso, Braque, Delaunay, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time, not the term "Cubism", but what would become known as the characteristics of [[Cubism]]: notably the notions of [[simultaneity]] and mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Once launched at the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the burgeoning movement would rapidly spread throughout Paris.

* After the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record, May 1910.&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;
* According to Gleizes' memoirs, Mercereau introduces him to Metzinger but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
* Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==Cubism==
{{Main article|Cubism}}
"The question of when Cubism began and who led the way in its development", writes art historian Christopher Green, "is inextricably tied up with the question of what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Picasso's landscapes painted at ''Horta de Hebro'' in 1909 (executed two years after ''Les Demoiselles'' and one year after the "cubes" of Braque's L'Estaque paintings) were considered the first Cubist painting by Gertrude Stein. It is generally recognized, however, that the first Cubist exhibition transpired in 1911. Jean Metzinger, judging from the Burgess interview, appears to have abandoned his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the ''faceting of form'' associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] at this time and exhibited with Braque at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of Picasso (''Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier'', 1910), Braque (''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910) and Metzinger (''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In his article entitled ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; published the same year, Metzinger acknowledges the birth of a new kind of painting; one that employed a mobile perspective. In that seminal text, Metzinger identifies similarities in the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], on the one hand, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the other. Of this group of five, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. It is now universally believed that Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of "a free, mobile perspective", and the "mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous".&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; He was the first to write of the fact that artists had abandoned traditional perspective and were now free to move around their subjects to paint them from various points in space, and at various moments in time.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; Metzinger's role at center of Cubism both as a painter and theorist prompted Guillaume Apollinaire to write of Picasso, Braque and Metzinger as the first three Cubist painters.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Now well beyond the teachings of Cézanne, the newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasize a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the [[Salon des Indépendants]] ensuring that the works of a small group of artists would be shown together: Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

===1911 Salon des Indépendants===
{{main article|Salon des Indépendants}}
The first group exhibition of Cubism transpired at the 1911 Indépendants.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; The result of the group show is a major scandal. Both the public and the press are outraged by the obscurity of the subject matter, represented as cones, cubes and spheres. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although similar terms (i.e., "cubes") have been used before in relation to the works of Cross (1901), Metzinger and Delaunay (1906, 1907) and Braque (1908), the term "Cubism" emerges for the first time at the inauguration of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants; imposed by 'scandal-mongering journalists who wished to create sensational news' (to use the words of Gleizes). The term was used derogatorily to describe the diverse geometric concerns reflected in the paintings of five artists in continual communication with one another: Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from this massive exhibition).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes ''Souvenirs, le cubisme 1908-14'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes 1 (Lyon, 1957), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], deeming it necessary to deflect the endless attacks throughout the press, accepts the term ''"Cubism"'' (the "ism" signifying a tendency of behavior, action or opinion belonging to a class or group of persons (an [[art movement]]); the result of an [[ideology]] or [[principle]]).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The term "Cubisme" is employed for the first time outside France in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Archipenko, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Segonzac, Le Fauconnier and Jean Marchand. But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed "the Emperor of Cubism" during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Apollinaire’s impulse was to define ''L'Esprit nouveau'' observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers. In his chapter on Picasso, however, there is no mention of the term Cubism.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Before the Indépendance, the Cubists infiltrated the placement committee to make sure they would all be shown as a group. Le Fauconnier, the secretary of the salon, facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works had been placed according to alphabetical order of the artists names. In Room 41 hung works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in ''Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre'', and ''Cri de Paris''. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1911 Salon d'Automne===
{{main article|Salon d'Automne}}
Another Cubist scandal is produced at the Salon d'Automne of 1911. The Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, held at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''), [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[František Kupka]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Francis Picabia]]. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. The first was the organized group showing by Cubists in ''Salle 41'' of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. In room 41 hung the work of Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. Articles in the press could be found in [[Gil Blas]], Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the April 20, 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; Thus Cubism spread into the literary world of writers, poets, critics, and art historians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v2r0HrOZmCMC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22the+press%22+1910,+salon+d'automne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AP0FMfXgwJ&amp;sig=nLRXYZg3us2vxH7LXlnxJvI_QuY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20press%22%201910%2C%20salon%20d'automne&amp;f=false Douglas Cooper, ''The Cubist Epoch'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y., Phaidon Press, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the Salon d'Automne in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes writes of the Salon d'Automne of 1911: "With the Salon d'Automne of that same year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent as it had been at the Indépendants." He writes: "The painters were the first to be surprised by the storms they had let loose without intending to, merely because they had hung on the wooden bars that run along the walls of the Cours-la-Reine, certain paintings that had been made with great care, with passionate conviction, but also in a state of great anxiety."&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was from that moment on that the word ''Cubism'' began to be widely used. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings - and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself - appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In nearly all the papers, all composure was lost. The critics would begin by saying: ''there is no need to devote much space to the Cubists, who are utterly without importance'' and then they furiously gave them seven columns out of the ten that were taken up, at that time, by the Salon. (Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in ''The New Age'' writes that "art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression." Carter continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at the Salon d'Automne, amid the Rhythmists [Cubists], I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two room remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhyth, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting. (Huntly Carter, 1911)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=1165303701968750 Huntley Carter, ''Letters from Abroad, The Post-Expressionists'', The New Age, a weekly review of Politics, Literature, and Art, New series, Vol. 9. No. 26, London: The New Age Press, Ltd., Thursday October 26, 1911. p. 617]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'':

:"To understand Cézanne is to foresee Cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat. (Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2824">The '''RIAI Travelling Scholarship''' is an award made annually by the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] to one or more students of architecture attending a school of architecture in the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Northern Ireland]].

The award has been made annually since 1935 and has former the basis for the careers of many notable Irish architects, among them [[Arthur Gibney]], [[Sam Stephenson]] and [[Trevor Leaker]].

Over the course of its history, the scholarship has been competed for in numerous ways. Current practice is for the RIAI to set a competition brief, which is then the subject of the design of a building or landscape by the competitors. An appointed jury of distinguished and learned architects and pedagogues then selects the winning entry.

The '''''Regatta at Sainte-Adresse''''' is an oil-on-canvas painting by the [[impressionism|impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. It was painted in 1867 and is owned by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

This painting and ''The Beach in Sainte-Adresse'' ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]) were probably conceived as a pair. They are identical in size, and their viewing point differs by only a few yards.
==Description==
[[Sainte-Adresse]], the well-to-do suburb of [[Le Havre]], was the home of Monet's father. Destitute, Monet spent the summer of 1867 with his father and aunt Sophie Lecadre at the cost of abandoning his companion, Camille Doncieux, and their newborn son, Jean. Monet attended the birth in Paris and returned to the coast a few days later.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437136?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=monet&amp;pos=4 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair of paintings juxtaposes this sunny regatta watched at high tide by well dressed bourgeois, with an overcast scene at low tide, fishing boats hauled onto the beach peopled with sailors and workers. Since Monet never exhibited the paintings side by side, the contrast between them was probably not intended as a social manifesto but instead reflected differing conditions under which the same place could be painted.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

On 25 June 1867, Monet reported that he was working on about twenty pictures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Among the seascapes, I am doing the regattas of Le Havre with many figures on the beach and the outer harbor covered with small sails." (Claude Monet)&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting is signed at the lower left.

'''"Replacements"''' is a [[short story]]  by American writer [[Lisa Tuttle]]. It concern a husband's surfacing insecurities as his wife's independence strengthens when she claims a bloodsucking pet for her very own.

Tuttle declared in an interview with M. M. Hall from ''Fantastic Metropolis'': "My first post-natal story to deal with in any way with motherhood was “Replacements”, written when my daughter was only seven months old. Make of that what you will…".&lt;ref name="fantastic"&gt;[http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tuttle/full/   The Mysterious Q&amp;A with Lisa Tuttle with M.M. hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Replacements" has been widely reprinted since being first published in 1992, both in Tuttle's own short story collections and various writers anthologies. It was also included on various "best of" anthologies in the year.
  
== Summary ==
As Stuart commences his walk to work, he notices  an animal "about the size of a cat, naked looking, with leathery, hairless skin and thin, spiky limbs that seemed too frail to support the bulbous, ill-proportioned body." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452274893/ ''American Gothic Tales'': edited with introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, New York: Plume, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Disgusted and horrified by the appearance of this animal, he crushes it with his foot. Immediately,  he is remorseful and his first instinct is to call his wife Jenny. Since he is not sure what her reaction will be, he waits to call her at the normal time in the afternoon. She is not able to take his call and does not return the call either. Stuart calls again, only to find that she has left work early. This, being unlike her, worries Stuart and he returns home as soon as possible.

Once home, he finds that Jenny brought one of the "creatures" with her. Stuart shows strong dislike towards the creature and wants Jenny to get rid of it. The two argue about what to do with Jenny's new "pet" but never come to a resolution. The creature begins taking up more of Jenny's time and attention. She also does abnormal activities with the creature (letting it drink blood from her). As this progresses, Stuart is regarded less and less and becomes very distanced from Jenny. Eventually, Jenny says that she is going to keep it whether Stuart likes it or not. Stuart then decides that he cannot live with the creature and the woman Jenny has become, and he moves out.

He begins to notice these creatures more and more. The women at work, women on the streets - every woman he sees seems to have one of these creatures. One evening while on his way home from work, he notices a woman sitting opposite with a gold chain that brings back memories. After leaving the train at the same stop as the woman, he strives to come up with something to say, but he sees the chain linked to one of the "pets" he despises and immediately lets her walk away. He absentmindedly walks to his old house where he sees the creature longing to be outside and he longing to be in.

==Adaptations==
The story was adapted for the 12th episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' season 2, also titled "Replacements" (28 November 1999).

The '''Smolin Gallery''' was an [[avant-garde]] art venue and gallery on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="Diggory2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diggory|first=Terence|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgsgw2xe-F0C&amp;pg=PT310|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1905-2|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its peak in the 1960s. It was known for its involvement with [[installation art]], [[performance art]] and experimental art, and was best known for the [[Allan Kaprow]] assemblage performance of September 11–12, 1962 entitled "Words",&lt;ref name="Hendricks2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendricks|first=Geoffrey|title=Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers University, 1958–1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40Qd97UAHPoC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3303-2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the first allowing the audience to participate in an art gallery context. Kaprow "used two continual rolls of cloth with words from poems, newspapers, comic and telephone books" during which the audience were asked to "tear off the words, staple them together, write notes, even attack and hack them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/|title=When New York Was Really Happening|publisher=Hyperallergic.com|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal fragments were pasted on the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;ref name="BanesBaryshnikov2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banes|first1=Sally|last2=Baryshnikov|first2=Mikhail|title=Reinventing Dance in the 1960s: Everything was Possible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY-BBzFGOpAC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2003|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-18014-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1963, [[Lima Towle|Lima]] and [[Tony Towle]] gave their first public recital at the gallery.&lt;ref name="Diggory2009"/&gt; 

In May 1963 the Smolin Gallery sponsored innovative [[Wolf Vostell]] events on TV. ''Do it yourself Dé-coll/age'' featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to use their own DIY liquids to create poster art on the walls and Wolf Vostells [[installation art|installation]] ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV Dé-coll/age'') was shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage Wolf Vostell, ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV dé-coll/age''), 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salter2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salter|first=Chris|title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&amp;pg=PA122|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19588-1|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gallery sponsored the ''Yam Festival'' and served as an information center during the event. The ''Yam Festival'', held at [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]s farm, in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] was venue on May 19, 1963 to actions and [[Happening]]s by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]] and [[Wolf Vostell]] who made the happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref name="Banes1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banes|first=Sally|title=Democracy's Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeJm6G8-T3cC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-1399-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/images/2/ Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Doris Totten Chase]] gave her first solo New York exhibition at the Smolin Gallery, featuring paintings on wood.&lt;ref name="Who1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Who|first=Inc.

'''''St Sebastian''''' is a painting of c. 1614 by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], showing the Christian [[Saint Sebastian]]. It dates to the early years of Rubens' stay in Rome - its sinuous line and defined figures are thought to be the result of his studies of [[Michelangelo]] and of Flemish [[Mannerism]]. It was bought by the [[Borghese]] directly from cardinal [[Neri Corsini (1614–1678)|Neri Corsini]] in [[Brussels]]. It is now in the [[Borghese collection]].

In 1618, Rubens wrote the English Sir Dudley Carlton a letter describing a collection of his own paintings he had at his home he wished to trade, including a painting of a naked St. Sebastian. It is more than likely not that this is that painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Daniel|last2=Krén|first2=Emil|title=St. Sebastian by RUBENS, Peter Paul|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/rubens/10religi/13religi.html|website=Web Gallery of Art|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories''''', sometimes shortened to '''''The Book of Virtues''''' ({{ISBN|0-684-83577-0}}), is an anthology edited by [[William Bennett]]. It was published on November 1, 1993 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and was followed by ''The Moral Compass: Stories for a Life's Journey'', in late 1995.

The book is intended for the moral education of the young and is divided into different virtues: [[self-discipline]], [[compassion]], [[moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[friendship]], [[employment|work]], [[courage]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]], [[honesty]], [[loyalty]], and [[faith]].

A spinoff for young audiences called ''The Children's Book of Virtues'' also came out in 1995. A year later, it served as the basis for a [[PBS Kids]] [[Adventures from the Book of Virtues|TV series]].

Bennett had served as [[Secretary of Education]] for President [[Ronald Reagan]] and often made school trips during his tenure. According to Bennett, the ''Book of Virtues'' grew out of conversations with teachers, who expressed difficulty in communicating common moral principles to diverse student bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/bill-bennett/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tripods''''' is a television adaptation of [[John Christopher]]'s ''[[The Tripods]]'' series of novels. It was jointly produced by the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Seven Network]] in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by [[Ken Freeman (composer)|Ken Freeman]].

Series one of ''The Tripods'', broadcast in 1984, which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the author of many radio plays [[Alick Rowe]], covers the first book, ''The White Mountains''; the 12-episode second series (1985) covers ''The City of Gold and Lead''.  Although a television script had been written for the third series, it never went into production.

The first series was released on both VHS and DVD. The BBC released ''Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2'' on DVD in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000R21294 |title=Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2 DVD |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series introduced several minor changes from the book, notably the shape of the [[Masters (The Tripods)|Masters]] and Tripods, which have tentacles (although the Tripods do have a mechanical claw-arm that they sometimes use) in the book; the Black Guard was introduced to serve as a tangible human antagonist as overuse of the Tripods themselves would be expensive to film and undermine their dramatic presence; gravity inside the Golden City was increased artificially, which is not mentioned in the TV series; the introduction of "cognoscs", spiritual life-forms vastly superior to the Masters themselves; and more other main characters, including love interests for both Will and Beanpole. The original texts have few female characters. John Christopher was asked about this for an interview on ''Wordcandy'',&lt;ref name=worldcandy&gt;[http://www.wordcandy.net/5-12-2006-the-white-mountains Wordcandy review of ''The White Mountains'']&lt;/ref&gt; replying that at the time of writing the series, it was generally accepted that girls would read books with boy main characters, but not vice versa. He also stated that he felt the addition of an entire family of girls to the TV series was somewhat "over the top".&lt;ref name=worldcandy/&gt; The series is also notable for featuring non-humanoid aliens, which was uncommon at the time.

[[Charlotte Long]], who played Will's love interest Eloise, died in a car crash shortly after the start of transmission of the first series. For the second series, the role was briefly recast, with [[Cindy Shelley]] appearing as Eloise during a dream sequence.

The [[tiger]] has been strongly associated with [[Korean people]] and [[Korean culture]]. It appears in not only the [[Korean foundation mythology]] but also in [[Korean folklore|folklore]], as well as a favorite subject of [[Korean art]] such as [[Korean painting|painting]] and sculpture. The mascot of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] is [[Hodori]], a stylized tiger to represent Korean people.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=294761&amp;v=42|script-title=ko:호랑이 |trans-title=Horang-i (Tiger)|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|language=Korean|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded by many as the divine spirit that guards the West, people in Korea consider the [[white tiger]] as a sacred creature in local folklore.

A tiger that has overcome trials and tribulations and understands the world is known to turn white, becoming a white tiger. Although it is a sacred creature that doesn’t harm people, it becomes angry when the ruler of the country conducts evil and inhumane deeds. Therefore, it has been told that powerful people become humble and rich people become generous when a white tiger appears.

As such, in Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirit and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power.

The oldest historical record about the tiger can be found in the myth of [[Dangun]], the legendary founding father of [[Gojoseon]], told in the Samguk Yusa, or the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms. According to the myth, a bear and a tiger wished to become human beings. The bear turned into a woman by observing the commandments to eat only mugwort and garlic for 100 days in the cave. But the tiger couldn’t endure the ordeal and ran off, failing to realize its wish.

There are 635 historical records about tigers in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=사냥-전통수렵 방법과 도구 |url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE001&amp;cp_code=cp0419&amp;index_id=cp04190009&amp;content_id=cp041900090001&amp;search_left_menu= |website=문화콘텐츠닷컴 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=ko |quote=『조선왕조실록』에 실린 호랑이 관련 기사는 모두 635건에 이른다.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a tiger that began from a myth can be also found in daily life as well. For example, the 19th-century painting named
“Sansindo” depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do the errands for the mountain’s guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built in the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called “Sansintaenghwa”, it is depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.

The painting “Jakhodo” is about a magpie and a tiger. The letter “jak” means magpie; “ho” means tiger; and “do” means painting. Since the work is known to keep away evil influence, there is a tradition to hang the art piece in the house in the first month of the [[Korean calendar|lunar calendar]]. On a branch of a green pine tree sits a magpie and the tiger, with a humorous expression, looks up at the bird. The tiger in “Jakhodo” doesn’t look anything like a strong creature with power and authority. Here again is Gu.{{non sequitur|date=February 2018}}

''Kkachi horangi'', paintings depicting magpies and tigers, was a prominent motif in the ''[[minhwa]]'' folk art of the Joseon period. In ''kkachi horangi'' paintings, the tiger, which is intentionally given a ridiculous and stupid appearance (hence its nickname "idiot tiger" 바보호랑이), represents authority and the aristocratic [[yangban]], while the dignified magpie represents the common man. Hence, ''kkachi horangi'' paintings of magpies and tigers were a satire of the hierarchical structure of Joseon's feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=까치호랑이|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4/6565|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KOREA Magazine March 2017|date=2017|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3M-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be also found around the royal tombs. In front of the burial mound stands the stone tiger sculptures. People believed that tigers also safeguarded the tomb, the permanent home for the dead. The sacredness of the tiger was also utilized for holding rituals that pray for rain. According to the historical records of the early Joseon era, the head of a tiger was offered as the sacrificial offering when performing a ritual praying for rain while Joseon was under the reign of kings such as [[Taejong]], [[Sejong]], [[Munjong of Joseon|Munjong]], and [[Danjong]].

=== Recent history ===
In 2011, UTA relocated its headquarters to a Civic Center Drive complex, which was renamed UTA Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2011/11/uta-moving-to-new-beverly-hills-location-195540/|title=UTA Moving To New Beverly Hills Location: 9336–9346 Civic Center Complex Named UTA Plaza|last=Finke|first=Nikki|date=2011-11-16|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company acquired [[N.S.

The agency created a new publishing imprint called Keywords Press in May 2014, to publish books by internet entertainers.

'''WHUT-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 32 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 33), is a Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) [[network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to the [[United States|American]] [[capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, District of Columbia]]. The station is owned by [[Howard University]], an [[historically black college]], and is [[sister station|sister]] to [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[urban contemporary]] radio station [[WHUR-FM|WHUR]] (96.3 FM). WHUT's studios are located on the Howard University campus, and its transmitter is located in the [[Tenleytown]] neighborhood in the [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest quadrant]] of Washington.

==History==
Channel 32 was founded on September 29, 1980 as '''WHMM-TV'''. The station was the first [[African-American]] owned and operated [[Public broadcasting|public]] [[non-commercial educational|educational]] station in the United States. In 1998, the station changed its [[call sign]] to WHUT, standing for Howard University Television, the station's branding.
[[File:WHUT-TV, Howard University.jpg|thumb|left|WHUT-TV station in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Since its founding, WHUT has won 11 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and 8 [[Communications Excellence to Black Audiences]] Awards. Despite this success, budget cuts have forced the station to roll back programming hours in recent years. As of October 21, 2007, digital channel 33 was on the air with a simulcast of the programming on analog channel 32. By November 21, 2007, the station had corrected an earlier problem with the lack of PSIP data so that digital receivers could lock on to it. Today, WHUT airs a variety of standard PBS programming, as well as programs produced by Howard University, and international programs focusing on regions such as the [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]].

Soon after the start of preparations for the [[Broadcast incentive auction#Spectrum reallocation|2016-17 spectrum reallocation auction]], Howard University announced that it was considering the sale of WHUT-TV's channel 33 allocation in the auction in order to alleviate longstanding financial issues at the university. The station was entered into the auction when it began in March 2016. Because of WHUT-TV's status as the only black-owned public television station in the United States, the decision attracted sustained opposition from faculty and community members who feared the loss of a rare minority voice in public media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University May Sell Rights to Its Public TV Station’s Spectrum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/business/howard-university-may-sell-rights-to-its-public-tv-stations-spectrum.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 December 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard announced WHUT-TV was withdrawn from the auction on February 16, 2017; the official reason was that the station's asking price had become low enough through the [[reverse auction]] process that it was apparent selling would not produce sufficient proceeds to justify ending operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University decides it won’t sell WHUT in spectrum auction |url=https://current.org/2017/02/howard-university-decides-it-wont-sell-whut-in-spectrum-auction/ |work=Current}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Washington, D.C. TV stations became a test market for [[Mobile DTV]], and WHUT was one of the participating stations.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHUT-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 32, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former UHF analog channel 32.

WHUT-TV commenced [[ATSC-M/H]] (Mobile DTV) broadcasting on February 27, 2011. WHUT-TV is the last remaining Washington-market broadcaster to broadcast an M/H signal. The signal nominally contains a feed of its main programming in standard definition on 32.1 and an audio feed of [[WAMU]] on 32.2, although neither stream contains audio or video data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHUT TSReader Capture 02/26/2018|url=https://rabbitears.info/atscinfo/dc-dca/27772-0_0.htm|website=RabbitEars.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26752">{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
The '''Washington Redskins trademark dispute''' was a legal effort by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who consider the term "[[redskin (slang)|redskin]]" to be an offensive and disparaging racial slur to prevent the owners of the [[Washington Redskins]] football team from being able to maintain federal [[trademark]] protection for this name. These efforts have primarily been carried forward in two cases brought before the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). While prevailing in the most recent case in which the trademarks were cancelled, petitioners have withdrawn for further litigation now that the legal issue has become moot due to a decision in another case which found the relevant portion of the trademark law to be an unconstitutional infringement on [[freedom of speech]].

==''Harjo'' case==
The first action in the dispute occurred in 1992, when [[Suzan Shown Harjo]], President of the Morning Star Institute, with six other prominent Native Americans represented by the [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] law firm of Minneapolis, petitioned the USPTO to cancel the trademark registrations owned by the Redskins' corporate entity of Pro-Football, Inc.  They based their lawsuit on the claim that federal trademark law states that certain trademark registrations are not legal if they are "disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous, or disreputable." The legal battle went on for seven years. In 1999 the PTO judges canceled the federal registration of the mark REDSKINS "on the grounds that the subject marks may disparage Native Americans and may bring them into contempt or disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davin L Seamon|title=Trademark Sensitivity: Learning from the Washington Redskins|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=8 July 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-sensitivity-learning-washington-redskins|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Steptoe &amp; Johnson PLLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners appealed the decision to a district court in the District of Columbia in ''[[Pro-Football, Inc. v.

Subsequent appeals have been rejected on the basis of ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]],'' which means that the specific Native American plaintiffs had pursued their rights in an untimely and delayed manner. In 2009 the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Washington Redskins can keep team name; Supreme Court refuses native Americans' suit| accessdate = November 15, 2015| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2009/1116/p02s07-usju.html| author=Warren Richey| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision does not bar the team from using the marks going forward, and the order itself is subject to further appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13220885/federal-judge-upholds-washington-redskins-trademark-ruling| title=Judge upholds ruling against Redskins trademark; team can appeal| date=July 8, 2015| author=Associated Press| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team president Bruce Allen expressed surprise at the decision, and that a summary judgement was made by the judge based upon the evidence submitted rather than proceeding to a trial. While the team continues to have certain rights to its trademarks, it must take action to protect those rights individually. The cancellation of federal registration of the trademarks means that the government will no longer take any action against anyone else using the name or logo, such as blocking counterfeit goods from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/07/08/bruce-allen-surprised-by-ruling-to-uphold-redskins-trademark-cancellation/| title=Bruce Allen ‘Surprised’ by Ruling to Uphold ‘Redskins’ Trademark Cancellation| author=Chris Lingebach| date=July 8, 2015| publisher=CBS DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Christine Haight Farley, a professor at [[American University Washington College of Law]]: A distinction should be made between trademarks and government registration.

==Supreme Court review==
Both the USPTO and Pro-Football, Inc. requested a review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) of the same legal issue, the constitutionality of banning a disparaging trademark. The USPTO appealed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which found in December 2015 that part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. That case ([[Matal v. Tam]]) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, "The Slants". The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the Lanham Act, NAPABA President Cyndie Chang stating “Racial slurs should not be recognized as commercial speech through federally-protected trademarks. “Freedom of speech does not require that the government allow racially derogatory terms to be trademarked so that a trademark owner can have exclusive rights to use and monetize such terms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://aapress.com/editorial/napaba-disagrees-with-band-in-trademark-case/| title=NAPABA disagrees with band in trademark case| date=January 21, 2017| publisher=Asian American Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2017 the court ruled unanimously in favor of Tam, the majority opinion stating "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15-1293 Martal V. Tam|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Redskins win trademark fight over the team’s name|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2017/06/29/a26f52f0-5cf6-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|accessdate=30 June 2017| author1=Ian Shapira| author2=Ann E.

In 1903, New York's first Yiddish theater was built, the [[Grand Theatre (New York City)|Grand Theatre]]. In addition to translated versions of classic plays, it featured vaudeville acts, musicals, and other entertainment.&lt;ref name="mvtimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mvtimes.com/robert-brustein-tradition-yiddish-theater-2380/ |author=CK Wolfson |title=Robert Brustein on the tradition of Yiddish theater |publisher=The Martha's Vineyard Times |date=October 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
