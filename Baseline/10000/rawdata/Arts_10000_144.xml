'''Architectural propaganda''' is the use of [[architecture]], intentionally or unintentionally, to communicate an attitude or idea in a persuasive manner, often for an explicitly [[propaganda|propagandic]] purpose. The use of architecture for propaganda purposes in order to influence attitudes, opinions, and feelings of the target audience can be found in many cultures across history. Since architecture itself is an expression of culture, the propaganda element of architecture can organically flow from the structure by nature of its being.

The fact that something may be used for propaganda is not a values statement about the thing itself. It is a simple truism that people are influenced by things around them and therefore, when those things around include architecture, people will be influenced by it as a part of an environment. This inherent quality of architecture then can be used by those with the desire to do so. This use is what transforms the architecture from a simple influence into a piece of propaganda.

The psychological dimension of architecture and propaganda means that even when a group or government has no direct intent to use architecture for propaganda purposes, the nature of architecture proceeding as it does from the human mind will express something about the designer and his or her culture. The architecture itself becomes an expression of the larger opinions of a cultural or social group which may then be impressed upon others. By virtue of observation of an architectural work, an individual may come to understand something about the original builder and his or her culture. Thus, even with no prior intent, architecture by its very nature has a built-in propaganda value.

==A Holistic Approach to Architecture==

[[Richard Swett]], the former [[Congressman]] from [[New Hampshire]] and US ambassador to [[Denmark]], an architect by training proposed that architecture need not be limited simply to buildings and grand constructions, but rather that architectural design and design considerations should permeate every aspect of life. He proposed that since everything utilized and created is designed at some level, it is possible and indeed necessary to include a great deal of thought and effort in the design of everything from buildings to desk lamps, to silverware.&lt;ref name="Swett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.di.net/articles/design-diplomacy-architectures-relationship-with-public-policy|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=Swett|first=Richard|date=September 30, 2000|work=[[Design Intelligence]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swett proposed that “examples of integrated artistic, social and environmental harmony created by architects who have served both their calling and the needs of society” are the ideal to be striven for in architectural design. He says that in Denmark, “all aspects of the design of a civilized life’s accouterments, from the shelter we need to the implements for feeding ourselves, are treated with the same high standards of design integrity and respect,”&lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; and proposes that American architecture and architects ought to follow a similar course. "In one of its articles in 1953, the [[Architectural Forum]] recognised US’s export architecture as a diplomatic tool, appreciating it and presenting US as a state exercising political world leadership and cultural leadership with the latter being driven especially by the US‘s architecture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicandculturaldiplomacy3.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/architecture-diplomacy-undervalued-dimension-of-branding/|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=kag0276|date=March 18, 2012|work=[[Architecture Diplomacy]]|accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture is a profession that is inherently engaged in public diplomacy by the nature of what it creates and who interacts with it, and that therefore, architects need to consciously participate in public diplomacy through their work rather than unwittingly be a part of it with no awareness of their significance. “The fact is too many architects are seriously marginalized, and I would go so far as to say, intentionally isolated, from the political process that determines the zoning, funding and the complex social and legal regulations that control the building of our shared environment. This subject needs to be confronted, debated and discussed in detail." &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; Swett concludes that the architectural profession would do well to develop “by assisting in the design of a blueprint that will frame the future influence of our profession beyond the limitations of bricks and mortar. Such a plan suggests that our fellow architects take up leadership roles in order to balance the tectonic, economic and political aspects of city/state planning more consciously. [[Thomas Jefferson]] also wrote in 1785: “I am proud to be an architect and don’t propose we go out and tear down any buildings. I do propose, however, we tear down some of the myths and misperceptions that architects have about public policy and vice versa.”” &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt;

Architectural propaganda is not limited simply to a given propaganda value or sum; rather, it has the ability to act in the wider realm of public diplomacy because of its importance and overreaching themes that touch all aspects of life. As such, when talking about [[Canada|Canadian]] public diplomacy, Evan Potter, a [[Professor]] of [[Communications]] at the [[University of Ottawa]] made the following points. He states that the entirety of public diplomacy must be thought of: "(1) temporally, in three time frames; (2) as an essentially contested concept that has many labels, such as cultural diplomacy, political communication, international public relations, democracy building, propaganda, branding, and military information operations; (3) as an endeavor whose effectiveness is linked to the level of societal support and understanding at home; and (4) as a form of statecraft that is not exclusive to foreign ministries but that, according to Bruce Gregory, “cuts across all political, economic, and military instruments and is essential to their implementation and success.” &lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Bruce. "Not Your Grandaparents’ Public Diplomacy," Presentation at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, November 30, 2005, Retrieved 2013-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Public diplomacy is not a single instrument or the exclusive preserve of a country’s foreign ministry; rather, it is a process, and as Gregory writes, it has “multiple components, each with their own organizations, budgets, tribal cultures, and rules for applying principles to behavior.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicdiplomacymagazine.com/a-new-architecture-for-canadian-public-diplomacy/|title=A New Architecture for Canadian Public Diplomacy |last=Potter|first=Evan|date=June 1, 2010|work=[[Public Diplomacy Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are not limited simply to their obvious and stated public diplomacy dimensions, but also to the inherent propaganda and public diplomacy value of architecture itself. It is this connectivity that brings together Swett's and Potter's theories into a practicable and useful set of operational principles for architecture in both its propaganda and public diplomacy aspects. Different countries and groups have utilized the propaganda and public diplomacy aspects of architecture with varying degrees of success and continue to do so today. Below, expanded are some of these countries and groups with examples of their architectural propaganda and public diplomacy.

==People's Republic of China==

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) is currently engaged in a prolonged public relations campaign with many other nations, the developing world particularly. This campaign has been termed a "charm offensive" by [[Joshua Kurlantzick]] in his book of the same name. Among the many elements of soft power used by the PRC is that of architecture. China has a rich architectural tradition to draw from and to publicize with. This allows the PRC government to promote tourism to famous architectural sites like the [[Great Wall]] or the [[Forbidden City]]. Furthermore, a rich architectural history combined with a desire to spread pro-PRC sentiment means that PRC funding of building projects abroad is increasingly common. ". . . Many scholars associated China's aid with giant white-elephant projects, like large buildings and ministries and similar structures."&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua. Charm Offensive. New Haven and London: Yale University, 2007, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wall of China may 2007.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.|The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.]]

In [[Mozambique]], a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony possessed of largely Portuguese-style architecture, in the capital city, Maputo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building In [[East Timor]], also a former Portuguese colony, the PRC funded and promoted the construction of that country's foreign ministry and funded the creation of a new East Timor [[embassy]] in [[Beijing]] despite the long-standing antagonism between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua. Charm Offensive. New Haven and London: Yale University, 2007, 100, 157-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of architecture to fuel tourism in the PRC has been highly successful. China is the third most visited country in the world. The number of overseas tourists was 55.98 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFli5xB9YgVoSunOYYFREW6BozmQ?docId=CNG.f55f656a9f597ee071fe1ead97d63e4a.3b1]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign exchange income was 45.8 billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]s, the world's fourth largest in 2010. The number of domestic tourist visits totaled 1.61 billion, with a total income of 777.1 billion yuan.&lt;ref name="factbox"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/06/content_8994009.htm  Factbox: Basic facts about China's economy]&lt;/ref&gt; While certainly all of this tourism cannot be attributed to architecture alone, a significant number of the tourist sites visited possess inherent architectural value.

==Corporate==

[[File:Chrysler Building by David Shankbone Retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.50|alt=The Chrysler Building in New York serves as coroprate propaganda for Chrysler Group LLC.|The Chrysler Building in New York serves as coroprate propaganda for Chrysler Group LLC.]]

As part of a corporation's overall marketing and branding campaign, when it comes to constructing a central office or corporate headquarters, architectural marketing or propaganda can be employed. A company's headquarters can be the ultimate expression or symbol of that company.&lt;ref name="Castillo"&gt;Castillo, Greg. Cold War on the Home Front: The Soft Power of Midcentury Design. Minneapolis: Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A building can make a statement to potential customers, clients, employees, or rivals. The architecture utilized in a corporate building can indicate general philosophies held by the corporation or principles it wishes to espouse. In some cases, corporate architecture can be used to show the success of a given corporation versus its rivals.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

Famous examples of corporate architecture can be found in cities around the world. In some cities, skyscrapers serve as unforgettable propaganda for the corporations for which they are named. In other places, corporate sponsorship of sports arenas, performing arts venues, and the sprawling headquarters of the corporations themselves serve as propaganda for their owners. A fine example of corporate architecture and propaganda can be found in the Chrysler Building in New York City. Built from 1928-1930, the Chrysler building gave the Chrysler Corporation a giant piece of advertising and propaganda. Not only could Chrysler lay claim to the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion, but the stainless steel spire of the building was styled after the grilles of then current Chrysler road cars. This huge building served as a massive statement of the success and power of the Chrysler Corporation while at the same time advertising its products to the world through the very architecture of the building.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

==Drug Cartel==

Mexican drug cartels have utilized architecture as part of their overall propaganda campaign. Large houses called "''narco mansions'' or ''narco castillos'' (drug mansions or castles)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are becoming an increasingly common feature of the recent drug conflicts in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to overwhelm and sway over local populaces and potential rivals, these demonstrations of wealth and power are built at least partly for their psychological value.

==Nazi==

[[Nazi architecture]] adopted many elements of [[neoclassicism]] and of [[art deco]] in keeping with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal fascination with [[Ancient Roman|Ancient Rome]]. Part of the Nazi cult involved the overaweing and subsuming of the individual into the greater German ''volk''. This giving over of oneself to the whole was also expressed through Nazi architecture. The three primary expressed roles found in Nazi architecture are the (i)[[Theatrical]], (ii)[[Symbol]]ic, and (iii)[[Didactic]], but each of these roles has its own place within the larger sphere of propaganda value.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally. |The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally.]]

Nazi architecture was designed to make the individual feel small and insignificant through its use of high ceilings. For example, at [[Nuremberg rallies]], the feeling produced by the use of massed groups coupled with the architecture of the Zepplintribune architecture was to create wonder and a powerful feeling of community. Indeed, Hitler stated in one of his Nuremberg rally speeches, "Not every one of you sees me and I do not see every one of you. But I feel you and you feel me!".&lt;ref&gt;Baynes, Norman H. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922-August 1939, V1 &amp; V2. London: Oxford University Press, 1942. V1 - {{ISBN|0-598-75893-3}} V2 - {{ISBN|0-598-75894-1}} ,197.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Nuremberg rallies, the overall effect of architecture was further enhanced through the use of many searchlights pointed directly upward in order to create a "Cathedral of Light" that even further served to invite the individual to buy into the Nazi worldview.

Another prominent conceptual feature of Nazi architecture was the "[[Ruin value|Theory of Ruin Value]]", first put forward by [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's personal architect. This theory postulated that in order for a civilization's influence to pass beyond the existence of the civilization itself, it was important that aesthetically pleasing and impressive ruins be left by the dilapidated buildings of that civilization. This theory, too, took inspiration from the ancient Romans and Greeks in attempting to emulate the even architectural remains of their civilizations with Nazi ones in thousands of years. Since the original inspiration for Nazi architecture was itself, the ancient Romans and Greeks, it was important to Hitler that at the end of the Thousand Year Reich, the remains would inspire others as Roman ruins had done for him.

An interesting remaining piece of Nazi architecture can be found in the former [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] which closed all airport operations in 2008. The main terminal was designed and built during the late 1930s and early 1940s according to a design by [[Ernst Sagebiel]] following the ideas of Speer and Hitler including that of ruin value. It was designed to be the main hub for Hitler's redesigned Berlin, to be called Germania. When completed, it was the world's largest building and today, should the building fall into disrepair, Speer and Hitler's ruin value theory may be demonstrated.

==United States (Federal)==

[[File:US Capitol Building Front New.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The [[Classical Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[United States]]' [[Founding fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] heavily influenced American Federal architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit04/context_activ-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas and creations of the [[Ancient Greeks]] and Romans held great sway not only in the formation of the United States and her founding documents, but also in the ways American ideals came to be expressed physically when it came to designing the Federal City, [[Washington, DC.]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/government.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln-Memorial WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The Embassy of the Hellenic Republic in Washington, DC has hosted lectures on the topic of Greek architectural influence on the Western World and in the United States in particular. Their website says, "Thomas Jefferson once wrote that “design activity and political thought are indivisible.”  He believed that architecture was an important vehicle for expressing political ideals, and he worked to ensure that Washington, as the seat of the American democracy, would become a city of stately and sophisticated buildings based on classical precedents."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office%3D1%26folder%3D14%26article%3D20822 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007144345/http://greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=14&amp;article=20822 |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can clearly be seen that while the modern state of Greece did not even exist at the time of the construction of many American government buildings, the Hellenic Republic is still able to derive some propaganda value and great national prestige from the influence of the ancient Greeks upon world history and architecture.

The style of construction found in the [[Lincoln Memorial]] closely parallels the design of a classical Greek temple. It utilizes a colonnade of thirty-six [[Doric order|Doric]] columns surrounding a central interior made up of three chambers. It serves as a memorial for American President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and for his service to the United States during the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The neoclassical design serves to reinforce the validity of the values Americans believed this president embodied at the time of the Memorial's construction.&lt;ref&gt;NRHP Nomination: {{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form: Lincoln Memorial |last=Pfanz |first=Donald C. |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=/Text/NRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps/FOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item(SUMMARY,COPYRIGHT) |date=1981-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002508/http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=%2FText%2FNRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps%2FFOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item%28SUMMARY%2CCOPYRIGHT%29 |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This itself is to some degree a self reinforcement, and thereby propaganda promoting the American values expounded therein.

The intent to showcase President Lincoln's connection to the founding values of the United States and to the values of the ancients Greeks and Romans is shown in the architecture of the monument itself. It is the implementation and exhibition of these values combined with the text inscribed on the memorial that transforms it from a simple honoring of a man into the honoring of all that he has been perceived to stand for. Even though the memorial is in President Lincoln's honor, it transcends this purpose and becomes a site for connection with American values themselves. The use of ancient Greek architecture allows for the transfer of the collective American values as passed down from the Lincoln, the Founding Fathers, and the ancient Greeks before them. This is consummate propaganda, it takes values, personifies them and holds them up as something to be aspired to, all through the use of architecture.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aerial View Rendering New US Embassy Londoin.jpg|thumb|left| alt= The design for the new US Embassy in London. Copyright KieranTimberlake.|The new US Embassy in London exhibits public diplomacy in its design.]] --&gt;

An interesting case study into the public diplomacy effects of architecture within a fixed culture and location is provided by the case of the United States embassy in London. “Public buildings project the identity of a country’s peoples, culture and aspirations. American public buildings convey the collective identity of our rich, culturally diverse, and increasingly complex society. An American embassy’s design expresses to the world the ideals of American democracy—the optimism, hope and promise of our time. By communicating the transcendent values that define the United States as a nation, the new Embassy of the United States of America in London has the potential to embody a new age of American openness, transparency, and renewed commitment to international collaboration.  Architecture itself becomes an act of public diplomacy; as the United States Department of State envisions, the design of the new Embassy “far transcends architecture and engineering… it is fully and firmly within the realm of international diplomacy.”” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://morphopedia.com/projects/new-u-s-embassy-in-london|title= New U.S. Embassy in London|last=Morphosis Team|date=August 31, 2011|work=[[Morphopedia]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old US Embassy in Grosvenor Square became the subject of intense dislike by the local inhabitants of London when, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, “the area surrounding the embassy was transformed into a fortress, complete with heavily armed guards, ugly security corridors and unsightly bollards – all of which defaced the elegant square.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"&gt;{{cite news|title=The US Embassy's move to Vauxhall|url= http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/Property-Experts/Expert-Opinions/The-US-Embassys-move-to-Vauxhall.html|last= Bar-Hillel |first= Mira |date=October 1, 2012|work=[[The London Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The new US Embassy integrates aspects of British landscaping and site design, rather than high fences, to create security”; “The main building itself will be “clad in glass to emphasise a transparent, open atmosphere.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"/&gt; The use of architecture itself in the design of the new US Embassy in London to present American ideals and values through the building itself is ingenious and exhibits well thought out and executed public diplomacy and propaganda value in its design.

'''ArtForo''' is an art fair, staged annually, that exhibits works by acclaimed [[Latin America|Latin American]] artists. Artforo also features lectures and symposiums dedicated to the understanding and promotion of [[Latin American art]].

==History==
ArtForo was started in 2016 in [[New York City]] by painter [[Oscar Abreu]] and curated by gallerist [[Karima Boutaleb]]. In its inaugural year, the Artforo show featured works by visual artists Mariano Sanchez, Joaquin Rosario, Pedro Gallardo, Pablo Palasso, Van Robert and Oscar Abreu. Writer Adrian Cabreja gave a lecture on [[Psycho-Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/on-thursday-washington-heights-will-host-the-first-ever-fair-of-dominican-art-040416|website=timeout.com|title=On Thursday, Washington Heights will host the first-ever fair of Dominican art|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnainfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160401/washington-heights/first-ever-art-fair-exclusively-for-dominicans-coming-washington-heights|title=First-Ever Art Fair Exclusively for Dominicans Coming to Washington Heights - Washington Heights - New York|website=DNAinfo|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ArtForo expanded into a multi-art fair that featured [[visual arts]], [[Culinary art|culinary arts]], and [[music]]. Musical performances were given by Emi Antonio, Alvaro, Gabbano, Roy Tavare and Zeo Munoz. David Nunez was the chef of the fair’s opening gala and provided a selection of Japanese/ Dominican fused foods. Lectures were provided by art critic Gamal, Michelen Stefan, art critic Odalis G. Perez, writer Ramon Dario Jimenez, producer Armando Guareno and Councilmember [[Ydanis Rodriguez]].&lt;ref name="elcaribe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2017/04/05/celebran-feria-arte-dominicano-artforo-nueva-york|author=Marcos A.

'''Art Deco''', sometimes referred to as '''Deco''', is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before [[World War I]].{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}} Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewelry, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} It took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts|Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes]] (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} It combined [[Modernism|modernist]] styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.

Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of [[Cubism]]; the bright colors of [[Fauvism]] and of the [[Ballets Russes]]; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of [[Louis Philippe I]] and [[Louis XVI]]; and the exotic styles of [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]], [[Indian art|India]], [[Persian art|Persia]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Maya art|Maya art]]. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The [[Chrysler Building]] and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.

In the 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], the Art Deco style became more subdued. New materials arrived, including [[chrome plating]], [[stainless steel]], and [[plastic]]. A sleeker form of the style, called [[Streamline Moderne]], appeared in the 1930s; it featured curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Renaut, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pages 110–116&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of [[modernism]] and the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture that followed.{{Sfn|Benton, Benton and Wood|''Art Déco (1910–1939)''|2010|pages=13–28}}

==Naming==
Art Deco took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] held in Paris in 1925,{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} though the diverse styles that characterize Art Deco had already appeared in Paris and [[Brussels]] before World War I.

The term ''arts décoratifs'' was first used in France in 1858; published in the Bulletin de la Société française de photographie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q "M. Cunny présente une Note sur un procédé vitro-héliographique applicable aux arts décoratifs", ''Bulletin de la Société française de photographie'', Société française de photographie. Éditeur: Société française de photographie (Paris), 1858], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 8-V-1012, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, ''Le Figaro'' newspaper used the term ''objets d'art décoratifs'' with respect to objects for stage scenery created for the [[Salle Le Peletier|Théâtre de l'Opéra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2716231 "Enfin, dans les ateliers, on travaille à l'achèvement des objets d'art décoratifs, qui sont très nombreux", Le Figaro, Éditeur: Figaro (Paris), 1869-09-18, no. 260], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65463131 ''L'Art décoratif à Limoges'', La Voix de la province : Revue littéraire, artistique, agricole et commerciale, 1862], (1862/04/01 (N1)-1863/01/01 (N12)), Bibliothèque francophone multimédia de Limoges, 2013-220524, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32858171s/date Revue des arts décoratifs (Paris), 1880-1902], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 4-V-1113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, furniture designers, textile, jewelry and glass designers, and other craftsmen were officially given the status of artists by the French government. In response to this, the ''École royale gratuite de dessin'' (Royal Free School of Design) founded in 1766 under King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to train artists and artisans in crafts relating to the fine arts, was renamed the National School of Decorative Arts (''[[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|l'École nationale des arts décoratifs]]''). It took its present name of ENSAD (''École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs'') in 1927.

During the 1925 Exposition the architect [[Le Corbusier]] wrote a series of articles about the exhibition for his magazine ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' under the title, "1925 EXPO. ARTS. DÉCO." which were combined into a book, "L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui" (Decorative Art Today). The book was a spirited attack on the excesses of the colorful and lavish objects at the Exposition; and on the idea that practical objects such as furniture should have any decoration at all; his conclusion was that "Modern decoration has no decoration".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier, ''L'Art décoratif d'aujourd'hui'',|Éditions Crès, Collection de "L'Esprit Nouveau", Paris, 1925|page=70-81}}

The actual phrase "Art déco" did not appear in print until 1966, when it featured in the title of the first modern exhibit on the subject, called ''Les Années 25 : Art déco, Bauhaus, Stijl, Esprit nouveau'', which covered the variety of major styles in the 1920s and 1930s. The term Art déco was then used in a 1966 newspaper article by Hillary Gelson in the Times (London, 12 November), describing the different styles at the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwYZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=evwzNMwV_h&amp;sig=V0-rrXusNYbSq3eS4oRIs08IPNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false David Raizman, Carma Gorman, ''Objects, Audiences, and Literatures: Alternative Narratives in the History of Design'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Mar 26, 2009], {{ISBN|1443809462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0kf0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FB0v14BG_y&amp;sig=R0aY_wYIx8EiSds5HUXQsH0S5Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false Richard Poulin, ''Graphic Design and Architecture, A 20th Century History: A Guide to Type, Image, Symbol, and Visual Storytelling in the Modern World'', Rockport Publishers, 2012], {{ISBN|1610586336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian [[Bevis Hillier]] published the first major academic book on the style: ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites ''The Times'' (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=430}} In 1971, Hillier organized an exhibition at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which he details in his book about it, ''The World of Art Deco''.&lt;ref name="Hillier4"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 | publisher=E.P.

==Origins==

===Society of Decorative Artists (1901–1913)===
[[File:Odilon Redon fireplace screen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A fireplace screen by the [[Symbolist]] painter [[Odilon Redon]] now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris (1908)]]
The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists, who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans. The term "arts décoratifs" had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the ''Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna'', was held in [[Turin]] in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including ''Arts et décoration'' and ''L'Art décoratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français, and later in the'' [[Salon d'automne]]''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=165-170}}

Parisian department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker [[Louis Vuitton]], silverware firm [[Christofle]], glass designer [[René Lalique]], and the jewelers [[Louis Cartier]] and [[Boucheron]], who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] had been entrusted to the department store [[Printemps]].&lt;ref name="Salon d'Automne 2012"&gt;[http://www.salon-automne.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/catalogue-SA-2012.pdf Salon d'Automne 2012, exhibition catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called "Primavera". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by [[Louis Süe]] and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent, Stephane, "L'artiste décorateur", in ''Art Deco, 1910–1939'' by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] (1910–1913), by [[Auguste Perret]] was the first landmark Art Deco building completed in Paris. Previously [[reinforced concrete]] had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. [[Henri Sauvage]], another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7 rue Trétaigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with [[Relief#High_relief|high reliefs]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[Édouard Vuillard]], and an Art Deco curtain [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]]. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Collins, ''Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture'', New York: Horizon Press, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=318–319}}

At its birth between 1910 and 1914, Art Deco was an explosion of colors, featuring bright and often clashing hues, frequently in floral designs, presented in furniture upholstery, carpets, screens, wallpaper and fabrics. Many colorful works, including chairs and a table by [[Maurice Dufrene]] and a bright Gobelin carpet by [[Paul Follot]] were presented at the 1912 [[Société des artistes décorateurs|Salon des artistes décorateurs]]. In 1912–1913 designer [[Adrien Karbowsky]] made a floral chair with a parrot design for the hunting lodge of art collector [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]].&lt;ref&gt;Descriptive text in the decorative arts display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The furniture designers Louis Süe and [[André Mare]] made their first appearance at the 1912 exhibit, under the name of the ''Atelier Française,'' combining colorful fabrics with exotic and expensive materials, including ebony and ivory. After World War I they became one of the most prominent French interior design firms, producing the furniture for the first-class salons and cabins of the French transatlantic ocean liners.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The vivid colors of Art Deco came from many sources, including the exotic set designs by [[Leon Bakst]] for the Ballets Russes, which caused a sensation in Paris just before World War I. Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier [[Fauvism]] movement led by [[Henri Matisse]]; others by the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] of painters such as [[Sonia Delaunay]]; others by the movement known as the Nabis, and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon, who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects. Bright colors were a feature of the work of fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]], whose work influenced both Art Deco fashion and interior design.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The art style known as [[Cubism]] appeared in France between 1907 and 1912, influencing the development of Art Deco. The Cubists, themselves under the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]], were interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the artists of the [[Section d'Or]] exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/frdc/hd_frdc.htm|title=French Art Deco|author=Goss, Jared|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1912 writings of [[André Vera]]. ''Le Nouveau style'', published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'', he expressed the rejection of [[Art Nouveau]] forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for ''simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie'', themes that would eventually become common within Art Deco; though with time the Deco style was often extremely colorful and anything but simple.&lt;ref&gt;André Vera, ''Le Nouveau style'', published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation was exhibited known as the ''[[La Maison Cubiste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, Nancy J.

The facade of the house, designed by Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished by Mare with neo-Louis XVI and Louis-Philippe style chairs and sofas that were updated with more angular features to make them go with the Cubist paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'': "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}} This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Detail of Duchamp-Villon's ''Façade architecturale'', catalog number 609, unidentified photographer, 1913.

The Cubist style continued within Art Deco, even as Deco branched out in many other directions. In 1927, Cubists [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Henri Laurens]], the sculptor [[Gustave Miklos]], and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of [[Post-Impressionist]] art by Henri Matisse and [[Cubist]] paintings (including ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet's staircase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22jacques+doucet%22+staircase+by+joseph+csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jvZeOQqDNb&amp;sig=FF6sbrEJ7QnZEljAmyquHlR6oJI&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jacques%20doucet%22%20staircase%20by%20joseph%20csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csaky's staircase in the home of Jacques Doucet |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aestheticus Rex |url=http://aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es/2011/04/jacques-doucets-studio-st-james-at.html |title=Jacques Doucet's Studio St. James at Neuilly-sur-Seine |publisher=Aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcKfjM9OknEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+rue+Saint-James,+Neuilly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QqQ4m-jgXG&amp;sig=5RJ8fjC4pmSaCE2b9sRNDNN3IfM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20rue%20Saint-James%2C%20Neuilly&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;The Modernist Garden in France'&amp;#39;, Dorothée Imbert, 1993, Yale University Press |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+joseph+Csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wywyzJn6BX&amp;sig=SeI2no9a60nGo0uIEfOSpbjxWVM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20joseph%20Csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csáky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, Edith Balas, 1998, p. 5 |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Cubist artists, Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house, including Pierre Legrain, who was in charge of organizing the decoration, and [[Paul Iribe]], Marcel Coard, [[André Groult]], [[Eileen Gray]] and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony, inspired by African art, and furniture covered with Morocco leather, crocodile skin and snakeskin, and patterns taken from African designs.{{Sfn|Arwas|1982|page=70}}

Art Deco was not a single style, but a collection of different and sometimes contradictory styles. In architecture, Art Deco was the successor to and reaction against Art Nouveau, a style which flourished in Europe between 1895 and 1900, and also gradually replaced the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] that were predominant in European and American architecture. In 1905 [[Eugène Grasset]] wrote and published ''Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6109619d |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale, Éléments rectilignes'&amp;#39;, 1905, Librarie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, Paris (in French) |language=fr |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of geometric elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating Art Nouveau style of [[Hector Guimard]], so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stressed the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. The reinforced concrete buildings of Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage, and particularly the [[Theatre des Champs-Elysees]], offered a new form of construction and decoration which was copied worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&amp;#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In decoration, many different styles were borrowed and used by Art Deco. They included pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Musée de l'Homme]] and the [[Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie]]. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], and the tomb of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]]. Artists and designers integrated motifs from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], Asia, [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Oceania]] with [[Machine Age]] elements.&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco Style |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential Art Deco"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ghislaine |title=Essential Art Deco |publisher=VA&amp;A Publications |location=London |isbn=0-8212-2833-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |title=Art Deco Study Guide |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025210428/http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |archivedate=25 October 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |title=Introduction to Art Deco |last=Juster |first=Randy |publisher=decopix.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202446/http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University Times"&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 October 2003 |title=How Art Deco came to be |journal=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |volume=36 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles borrowed included Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Italian [[Futurism]], as well as Orphism, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], and [[Modernism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8-10}}&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art, Design and Visual Thinking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |title=Art, Design and Visual Thinking |last=Jirousek |first=Charlotte |year=1995 |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202040916/http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco also used the clashing colors and designs of Fauvism, notably in the work of Henri Matisse and [[André Derain]], inspired the designs of art deco textiles, wallpaper, and painted ceramics.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;  It took ideas from the high fashion vocabulary of the period, which featured geometric designs, chevrons, zigzags, and stylized bouquets of flowers. It was influenced by discoveries in [[Egyptology]], and growing interest in the Orient and in African art. From 1925 onwards, it was often inspired by a passion for new machines, such as airships, automobiles and ocean liners, and by 1930 this influence resulted in the style called [[streamline moderne]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=7-8}}

==Style of luxury and modernity==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Deco was associated with both luxury and modernity; it combined very expensive materials and exquisite craftsmanship put into modernistic forms. Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the [[Great Depression]], the style changed and became more sober.

A good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]], designed by [[Armand-Albert Rateau]] (1882-1938) made between 1922-25. It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965. The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The walls are covered with molded ''lambris'' below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on with bases and a plinth of sculpted wood. The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk. Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=82}}

By 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs. The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928-30, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]], had a unique American feature. Since it was constructed during [[Prohibition]], when serving alcohol was prohibited, it included a secret bar hidden behind the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Home Page of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=77}}

{{main article|International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts}}
The event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925.  This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the [[Grand Palais]] on the right bank to [[Les Invalides]] on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine. The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new [[Soviet Union]], though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate. It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods.

The Hôtel du Riche Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by [[Jean Dupas]]. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of [[modernist architecture]].{{Sfn|Charles|2013|pages=35-104}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night.&lt;ref&gt;John Burchard and Albert Bush Brown, ''The Architecture of America'' (1966), Atlantic, Little and Brown, page 277&lt;/ref&gt; The first New York skyscraper, the [[Woolworth Building]], in a neoclassical style, was completed in 1913, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Building (1924) had ionic and doric columns and a classical Doric [[hypostyle]] with a frieze. The [[American Radiator Building]] by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's [[Guardian Building]], which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist [[Wirt C. Rowland]], the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments.

The New York skyline was radically changed by the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by [[William Van Alen]]. It was a giant seventy-seven floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles. The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator cap decorations. The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.{{Sfn|Benton|202|pages=249-258}}

The Chrysler Building was followed by the [[Empire State Building]] by [[William F. Lamb]] (1931) and the RCA Building (now the [[Comcast Building]]) in [[Rockefeller Center]], by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed the skyline of New York. The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design. Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities. The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style. Rockefeller Center added a new design element: several tall building grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.{{Sfn|Morel|2012|pages=125-30}}

In 1925 two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunard, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, [[The French Union of Modern Artists]], in 1929. Its members included architects [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Francis Jourdain]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, [[Konstantin Melnikov]]; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers [[Jean Fouquet]] and [[Jean Puiforcat]]. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture'', Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!"{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8}} However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt; Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council]]) and the [[Palais de Chaillot]] by [[Louis-Hippolyte Boileau]], [[Jacques Carlu]] and [[Léon Azéma]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]]; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.

After World War II the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and [[Mies Van der Rohe]]. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as jukeboxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. [[Postmodern architecture]], which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Design Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013725/http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco. Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers. His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']]. His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor.&lt;ref&gt;Louis René Vian, ''Les Arts décoratifs à bord des paquebots français'', Éditions Fonmare, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The other painter closely associated with the style is [[Tamara de Lempicka]]. Born in Poland, she emigrated to Paris after the [[Russian Revolution]]. She studied under [[Maurice Denis]] and [[André Lhote]], and borrowed many elements from their styles. She painted portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style.&lt;ref&gt;Blondel, Alain (1999). ''Tamara de Lempicka: a Catalogue Raisonné 1921–1980''. Lausanne: Editions Acatos.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools. There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to [[social realism]]; they included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and the Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]]. The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. Diego Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' (1933) for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of [[Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Alan (1978).

Most of the sculpture of the Art Deco period was, as the name suggests, purely decorative; it was designed not for museums, but to ornament office buildings, government buildings, public squares and private salons. It was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building; the themes were usually chosen by the patron, and abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. It was frequently attached to facade of buildings, particularly over the entrances and lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0671808044 Eva Weber, ''Art deco in America''], Exeter Books, 1985, p. 32, {{ISBN|0671808044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegorical sculptures of the dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle were the essential decorative feature of the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, in 1912. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] reinvented the classical ideal for his statue of the River (1939), now at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In the 1930s, a whole team of sculptors made sculpture for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. The buildings of the Exposition were covered with low-relief sculpture, statues. [[Alfred Janniot]] made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo. The [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by [[Charles Malfray]], Henry Arnold, and many others.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=165-66}}

In the United States, many European sculptors trained at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, came to work; they included [[Gutzon Borglum]], sculptor of Mount Rushmore [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other American sculptors, including [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]], had studied with [[Auguste Rodin]] in Paris. The 1929 stock market crash largely destroyed the market for monumental sculpture, but one grand project remained; the new Rockefeller Center. The American sculptors [[Lee Lawrie]] and [[Paul Manship]] designed heroic allegorical figures for facade and plaza. In San Francisco, [[Ralph Stackpole]] provided sculpture for the facade of the new [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] building.

One of the best known and certainly the largest Art Deco sculpture is the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' by the French sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. [[François Pompon]] was a pioneer of modern stylized [[animalier]] sculpture. He was not fully recognized for his artistic accomplishments until the age of 67 at the Salon d'Automne of 1922 with the work ''Ours blanc'', also known as ''The White Bear'', now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|page=551|edition=First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons. One genre of this sculpture was called the [[Chryselephantine]] statuette, named for a style of ancient Greek temple statues made of gold and ivory. One of the best-known Art Deco salon sculptors was the Romanian-born [[Demétre Chiparus]], who produced colorful small sculptures of dancers. Other notable salon sculptors included [[Ferdinand Preiss]], [[Josef Lorenzl]], Alexander Kelety, Dorothea Charol and Gustav Schmidtcassel.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=141-163}}

Parallel with these more neoclassical sculptors, more avant-garde and abstract sculptors were at work in Paris and New York. The most prominent were [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Gustave Miklos]], [[Jean Lambert-Rucki]], [[Jan et Joël Martel]], [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Pablo Gargallo]].&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/robesdePaulPoir00Irib Paul Iribe, ''Les robes de Paul Poiret'', 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations of [[Georges Barbier]], and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine ''La Gazette du bon ton'' perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer [[Mistinguett]] and for [[Air France]]. Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]], who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'' in 1935.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events.

The architectural style of art deco made its debut in Paris in 1903-04, with the construction of two apartment buildings in Paris, one by Auguste Perret on rue Trétaigne and the other on rue Benjamin Franklin by Henri Sauvage. The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] style.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages 299 and 318}} Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, 15 [[avenue Montaigne]]. Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in Paris.{{Sfn|Plum|2014|page=134}}

After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; [[Los Angeles City Hall]] combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], while the [[Los Angeles railroad station]] combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture. Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the intake towers of [[Hoover Dam]]. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts) in [[Mexico City]] by {{ill|Federico Mariscal|es}}, the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya Metro Station]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.

The Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'', whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by [[Lalique]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings. Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. An early example was the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]]; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics. The [[Guardian Building]] (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters. The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the "Cathedral of Commerce". The Medical and Dental Building called [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]] was inspired by [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

In France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the [[Palais de la Porte Dorée]] (1931) by [[Albert Laprade]], [[Léon Jaussely]] and [[Léon Bazin]]. The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the [[Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931]], to celebrate the people and products of French colonies. The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]s and [[pyramid]]s, while the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall. The largest of all is [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, which opened in 1932. Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons The interior design by [[Donald Deskey]] used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality The [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe. The [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe. The [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] Theater in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called ''The gate of 100 pleasures''; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in [[Asmara]] in what is now [[Eritrea]]. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=197-199}}

In the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called [[Streamline Moderne]] or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style. Buildings in the style were had rounded corners, long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the [[Mossehaus]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]], and later in the [[Hoover Building]], an industrial complex in the London suburb of [[Perivale]]. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=197}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Decoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases. Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 André Vera published an essay in the magazine ''L'Art Décoratif'' calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers. A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry. This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies. It became sleeker and less ornamental. Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline modern style. New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory text on Art Deco in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building. Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dorée at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies. The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion. The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=250}}

French furniture from 1910 until the early 1920s was largely an updating of French traditional furniture styles, and the art nouveau designs of [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Charles Plumet]] and other manufacturers. French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the [[Biedermeier]] style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufrene, André Groult, André Mare and Louis Suë took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and [[Louis Philippe]] with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=91-93}}

The painter André Mare and furniture designer [[Louis Suë]] both participated the 1912 Salon. After the war the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the ''Compagnie des Arts Française'', but usually known simply as Suë and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of [[Jean Patou]].The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51}}

The most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the "House of the Rich Collector", at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including [[ebony]], [[mahogany]], [[rosewood]], [[Ambon Island|ambon]] and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=15}} His furniture was based upon 18th-century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=56}}

[[Jules Leleu]] was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the [[Élysée Palace]], and for the first-class cabins of the steamship ''Normandie''. his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture at the end of in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=18-19}} In Italy, the designer [[Gio Ponti]] was famous for his streamlined designs.

The costly and exotic furniture of Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the ''arts décoratif'' style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm Alexandra Griffith Winton, ''Design, 1925–50''. The Metropolitain Museum of Art, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, furniture designs adapted to the form, with smoother surfaces and curved forms. The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=36}} The [[Waterfall style]] was popular the 1930s and 1940s, the most prevalent Art Deco form of furniture at the time. Pieces were typically of plywood finished with blond veneer and with rounded edges, resembling a waterfall.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Furniture of the Jazz Age|journal=Old-House Interiors|publisher=William J.

Streamline was a variety of Art Deco which emerged during the mid-1930s. It was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce aerodynamic drag at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History" /&gt; One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent; meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122–124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

New industrial materials began to influence design of cars and household objects. These included [[aluminum]], [[chrome plating|chrome]], and bakelite, an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances.

Ocean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the ''Style Paquebot'', or "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS ''Normandie'', which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Art Deco influenced fashion with a combination of geometric shapes, avant-garde style and luxury in clothing such as works of [[Paul Poiret]], [[Charles Worth]] and [[Jean Patou]]. In the 1920s, designers were inspired by the stage sets of the [[Ballets Russes]], fabric designs and costumes from [[Léon Bakst]] and creations by the [[Wiener Werkstätte]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, designers including René Lalique and Cartier tried reduce the traditional dominance of [[diamonds]] by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires. They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw a large number of diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used [[platinum]] instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black [[onyx]], which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Jewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers, to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants. Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Rapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

The established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, [[Chaumet]], Georges Fouquet, [[Mauboussin]], and [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]] all created jewelry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with [[jade]], [[lapis lazuli]], diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. [[Raymond Templier]] designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. [[Gerard Sandoz]] was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer René Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies or mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} The jeweler [[Paul Brandt]] contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. [[Jean Despres]] made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. [[Jean Dunand]] was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

Like the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of [[François Coty]], but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners [[SS Ile de France|SS ''Ile de France'']] in 1927 and the SS ''Normandie'' in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals. For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light. His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers. His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and [[Maurice Marinot]], who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases. The firm of [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] from the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form. More delicate multicolored works were made by [[Gabriel Argy-Rousseau]], who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

The Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients. Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches. In 1937, the [[Steuben Glass Works|Steuben]] glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}} [[Louis Majorelle]], famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the [[Aciéries de Longwy]], a steel mill in [[Longwy]], France.

Art Deco artists produced a wide variety of practical objects in the Art Deco style, made of industrial materials from traditional wrought iron to chrome-plated steel. The American artist [[Norman Bel Geddes]] designed a cocktail set resembling a skyscraper made of chrome-plated steel. Raymond Subes designed an elegant metal grille for the entrance of the Palais de la Porte Dorée, the centerpiece of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. The French sculptor Jean Dunand produced magnificent doors on the theme "The Hunt", covered with gold leaf and paint on plaster (1935).{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=71-81}}

Napier has been nominated for UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |title=Napier Earthquake |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date=3 February 1931 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706013856/http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |archivedate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |title=Home – Art Deco Trust |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630211317/http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |archivedate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wellington]] has retained a sizeable number of Art Deco buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/across-the-city/art-deco-heritage-trail |title=Art Deco heritage trail |publisher=wellington.gov.nz |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, surviving Art Deco structures are mainly in the major cities; [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Vancouver]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)|College Park]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]).
File:Edificios La Nacional I y II.JPG | La Nacional Buildings [[Mexico City]], Mexico (1932)
In [[Mexico]], the most imposing Art Deco example is interior of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts), finished in 1934 with its elaborate decor and murals. Examples of Art Deco residential architecture can be found in the [[Condesa]] neighborhood, many designed by [[Francisco J. Serrano]].

In the United States, Art Deco buildings are found from coast to coast, in all the major cities. It was most widely used for office buildings, train stations, airport terminals, and movie theaters; residential buildings are rare. In the 1930s, the more austere streamline style became popular. Many buildings were demolished between 1945 and the late 1960s, but then efforts began to protect the best examples. The City of Miami Beach established the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]] to preserve the colorful collection of Art Deco buildings found there.

The architectural style first appeared in Paris with the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–13) by Auguste Perret but then spread rapidly around Europe, until examples could be found in nearly every large city, from London to Moscow. In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] style and [[Expressionist architecture]]. Notable examples include Erich Mendelsohn's Mossehaus and [[Schaubühne]] theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s [[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]] and his [[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]] in Berlin, the Anzeiger Tower in [[Hannover]] and the Borsig Tower in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Kathleen|title=Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521571685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, Brussels. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg |publisher=Basilicakoekelberg.be |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal have some striking examples of Art Deco buildings, particularly movie theaters. Examples in Portugal are the Capitólio Theater (1931) and the Éden Cine-Theater (1937) in [[Lisbon]], the [[Rivoli Theatre (Portugal)|Rivoli Theater]] (1937) and the [[Coliseu do Porto|Coliseu]] (1941) in [[Porto]] and the Rosa Damasceno Theater (1937) in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]. An example in Spain is the Cine Rialto in Valencia (1939).

During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt; as well as the design of various public buildings.&lt;ref name="Design Handbook" /&gt; Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |title=Art Deco Buildings |year=2007 |publisher=london-footprints.co.uk |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |archivedate=11 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea |year=2006 |publisher=Art Deco Classics |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Underground]] is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] in Brentford. Also in West London is the Hoover Building, which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s.

===India===
{{See also|Art Deco in Mumbai}}

The Indian Institute of Architects, founded in Bombay in 1929, played a prominent role in propagating the Art Deco movement. In November 1937, this institute organized the ‘Ideal Home Exhibition’ held in the Town Hall in Bombay which spanned over 12 days and attracted about one hundred thousand visitors. As a result, it was declared a success by the 'Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects'. The exhibits displayed the ‘ideal’, or better described as the most ‘modern’ arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models. The exhibition focused on various elements of a home ranging from furniture, elements of interior decoration as well as radios and refrigerators using new and scientifically relevant materials and methods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mumbai Fables|last=Prakash|first=Gyan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780691142845|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guided by their desire to emulate the west, the Indian architects were fascinated by the industrial modernity that Art Deco offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western elites were the first to experiment with the technologically advanced facets of Art Deco, and architects began the process of transformation by the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bombay’s expanding port commerce in the 1930s resulted in the growth of educated middle class population. It also saw an increase of people migrating to Bombay in search of job opportunities. This led to the pressing need for new developments through Land Reclamation Schemes and construction of new public and residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33153751|title=Bombay : the cities within|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=1995|publisher=India Book House|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Mulla-Feroze, Umaima.|isbn=818502880X|location=Bombay|oclc=33153751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallelly, the changing political climate in the country and the aspirational quality of the Art Deco aesthetics led to a whole-hearted acceptance of the building style in the city’s development. Most of the buildings from this period can be seen spread throughout the city neighbourhoods in areas such as Churchgate, Colaba, Fort, Mohammed Ali Road, Cumbala Hill, Dadar, Matunga, Bandra and Chembur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300923025|title=Bombay Deco|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=2008|publisher=Eminence Designs|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Gobhai, Noshir.|year=|isbn=8190382152|location=Mumbai|pages=|oclc=300923025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdecomumbai.com/inventory/|title=Inventory {{!}} Art Deco|website=www.artdecomumbai.com|language=en-US|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco in South America is present especially at the countries that received a great wave of immigration on the first half of the 20th century, with notable works at their richest cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in [[Brazil]] and Buenos Aires in [[Argentina]].The [[Kavanagh building]] in [[Buenos Aires]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure when it was completed, and a notable example of late Art Deco style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In many cities, efforts have been made to protect the remaining Art Deco buildings. In many U.S. cities, historic art deco movie theaters have been preserved and turned into cultural centers. Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument. The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style. In [[Havana]], Cuba, a large number of Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated. Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance.

In the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco (or Neo-Art Deco), have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Capitman"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0525934421 Barbara B.

'''Baburao Painter''' (1890–1954) was an [[Cinema of India|Indian film]] director.&lt;ref name="Gulzar2003"&gt;{{cite book | author1=[[Gulzar]] | author2=[[Govind Nihalani]] | author3= Saibal Chatterjee | title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema: An Enchanting Close-Up of India's Hindi Cinema | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC&amp;pg=PT549 | accessdate=11 November 2012 | year=2003 | publisher=Popular Prakashan | isbn=978-81-7991-066-5 | page=549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born Baburao Krishnarao Mestry in 1890 in Kolhapur. He taught himself to [[paint]] and derives its name "Painter". (hence the name) and [[sculpt]] in [[academic art]] school style. He and his artist cousin [[Anandrao Painter]] between 1910 and 1916 were the leading painters of stage backdrops in [[Western India]] doing several famous curtains for Sangeet Natak troupes and also for Gujarati [[Parsi theatre]]s. They became avid filmgoers following [[Raja Harishchandra]].

Baburao and his cousin Anandarao bought a movie projector from the [[Mumbai]] [[flea market]] and proceeded to exhibit films, studying the art of movies all the while. Anandarao was busy with assembling a camera for their maiden venture, and his untimely death at this juncture compelled Baburao to go it alone

They turned to cinema first as exhibitors while trying to assemble their own camera. Anandrao however died in 1916 and Painter and his main disciple [[Vishnupant Damle|V.G. Damle]] eventually put together a working camera in 1918.

==Film career==
[[File:Kolhapur Memorial to Baburao Painter 2012 IMG 1601.jpg|thumb|right|A Memorial to Baburao Painter in [[Kolhapur]]]]
Baburao was one of the leading stage painter for  theatres in Western India during the period of 1910 and 1916. He was also a film enthusiast and founded [[Maharashtra Film Company]] in 1919. To enable this Baburao  borrowed money from [[Tanibai Kagolkar]], a long-time admirer. Movie acting, especially tamasha's were looked down upon in conservative societies like Kolhapur so the studio itself was a living quarter for quite a few including leading ladies – Gulab Bai (renamed Kamaladevi) and Anusuya Bai (renamed Sushiladevi). Painter got onboard his old colleagues including Damle and [[S. Fatehlal]] and later on [[V. Shantaram]], trio who later on left him to set up their  own studio called [[Prabhat Film Company]].

Baburao's first feature film was Sairandri (1920), which got heavily censored for its graphic depiction of slaying of Keechak by [[Bhima]]. However the movie itself got positive critics and commercial acclaim spurring Painter on to take on more ambitious projects. He wrote his own screenplays, and led the three-dimensional space rather than stage-painting in the Indian movie. 1921/22, he published the first Indian films and programs designed to even the [[movie poster]]s. Publicity was not alien to Painter's many talents – in 1921–22, he distributed programme booklets complete with photographs and film details.

Baburao was a man of many talents – he wrote his own screenplays and he was also the first Indian filmmaker to adopt the method, [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] had described as 'stenographic' – he sketched the costumes, movements, and characters. He changed the concept of set designing from painted curtains to solid multi-dimensional lived in spaces, he introduced artificial lighting and understood the importance of publicity. As early as 1921–22 he was the first to issue programme booklets, complete with details of the film and photographs. He also painted himself tasteful, eye-catching posters of his films.

A perfectionist, he insisted upon any number of rehearsals. As Zunzarrao Pawar, a [[cast member]], said '` He would take umpteen rehearsals before actual shooting....but he was very slow in film-making. That was why we used to get annoyed with him sometimes.'`

The advent of sound in 1931 did not excite Painter. However, after a few more [[silent film]]s, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.

He returned to painting and sculpture, his original vocation barring sporadic ventures like remaking Savkari Pash in sound in 1936, Pratibha (1937), one of his few preserved films which is a good illustration of Painter's control over big sets, lighting and crowd scenes and Lokshahir Ramjoshi (1947) on Shantaram's invitation.

The beautiful posters that Baburao painted for his films prompted the advice of not wasting his talent on ''dirty walls'', that an [[art gallery]] was the correct destination! Prophetic words indeed, because later his posters were up at [[J.J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai]] and much admired by the principal, Gladstone Solomon.

==Filmography==

=== Actor ===
* Kalyan Khajina (1924)
* Sinhagad (1923) – Emperor Shivaji

Together, Sinhagad and Kalyan Khajina won a medal at the Wembley Exhibition, London. One newspaper, Daily Express, described the films as ''full of strangely wistful beauty, and acted with extraordinary grace.''

===Art Director===
* Usha (1935/I)
* Usha (1935/II)

===Writer===
* Sairandhri (1920)

===Cinematographer===

* [[Sairandhri (1920 Hindi film)]]: This episode from the Mahabharata dealt with the slaying of Keechak by [[Bhima]] (one of the Pandava princes), and the film was based on the play Keechak Wadh by K.P. Khadilkar. The play itself was banned because of the perceived criticism of Lord Curzon. The intense realism of the killing was horrifying to the audience, and the scenes were deleted.

=== Director ===

* Surekha Haran (1921): This was the debut film of [[V. Shantaram]]
* Bhagwata Bhakta Damaji (1922)
* Damaji (1922)
* Vatsalaharan (1923)
* Sinhagad (1923): Baburao shifted from painted curtains to multi-dimensional sets. Another first – he used artificial lighting to create the effect of fog and of moonlight. The film was based on [[Hari Narayan Apte]]'s novel "Gad Aala Pan Sinha Gela" (गड आला पण सिंह गेला). The protagonist Tanaji was a follower of [[Shivaji]] and died while capturing Kondhana Fort.While filming Sinhagad, Baburao fell off a horse, the injury causing a lifelong speech defect. Sinhagad proved so popular that it attracted the Revenue Department's attention to bring about introduction of Entertainment Tax.
* Sati Padmini (1924)
* Shri Krishna Avatar (1924)
* Shaha la Shah (1925)
* Rana Hamir (1925)
* Maya Bazaar (1925)
* [[Savkari Pash]] (1925): Dealt with money lending and the plight of poor farmers. However the audience long fed on mythological fantasy and historical love was just not prepared for so strong a dose of realism and the film did not do well. Baburao returned to costume dramas. The film failed. Baburao Painter returned to the tried-and-true subject-matter.Painter's artistic masterpiece remains Savkari Pash (1925), dealing with money lending, a problem that blighted the lives of countless illiterate, poor farmers. J.H.Wadia on the two versions of Savkari Pash: ''I faintly remember the silent Savkari Pash...But it was only when I saw the talkie version that I realised what a great creative artist he (Baburao) was. I go into a trance when I recollect the long shot of a dreary hut photographed in low key, highlighted only by the howl of a dog.''&lt;ref name=Filmheritagefoundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Savkari Pash (1925)|url=http://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/savkari-pash-the-indian-shylock-1925-80-mins/|website=filmheritagefoundation.co.in|publisher=Film Heritage Foundation|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theatre lighting]], a '''bastard color''' is a color, typically in a [[color gel]], wherein the predominant color is blended with small amounts of complementary colors; for example, a "bastard orange" gel would produce predominantly [[orange (color)|orange]] light with undertones of [[blue (color)|blue]]. Bastard colors appear warmer and more natural than pure colors and are used to replicate [[Sunlight|natural light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnta.com/lighting/gels/e-colour-004-med-bastard-amber/ |title=Rosco E-Colour #004: Medium Bastard Amber |accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2588">The '''Boston Watercolor Club''' (sometimes written Boston Water Color Club) was a society formed in 1887 to promote women [[watercolor]] artists in and around Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==
The Boston Watercolor Club was formed in 1887 to promote and exhibit the work of women artists at a time when they were barred from admission to the male-run [[Boston Watercolor Society]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt; The group held annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; In 1896 the group began admitting male members,&lt;ref name=si/&gt; and artists such as [[John La Farge]]&lt;ref name=yarnall/&gt; and [[Maurice Prendergast]]&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; joined the club.

The group had counterparts in other cities, including the [[Baltimore Watercolor Club]], founded in 1885 because women artists were barred from the [[Charcoal Club of Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=rasmussen/&gt;

The club's records from the period 1887–1916 are held by the [[Archives of American Art]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

[[File:Brevis Commentarivs,p15.png|thumb|300px|right|The catchword (in this case the last three letters of a divided word) is at the bottom of the page]]
A '''catchword''' is a [[word]] placed at the foot of a handwritten or [[Printing|printed]] page that is meant to be bound along with other pages in a book. The word anticipates the first word of the following page. It was meant to help the [[bookbinder]] or printer make sure that the leaves were bound in the right order or that the pages were set up in the press in the right order. Catchwords appear in some medieval manuscripts, and appear again in printed books late in the fifteenth century. The practice became widespread in the mid sixteenth century, and prevailed until the arrival of industrial printing techniques late in the eighteenth century.

Theodore Low Devinne's 1901 guide on ''Correct Composition'' had this to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For more than three centuries printers of books appended at the foot of every page the first word or syllable of the next page. This catchword was supposed to be needed by the reader to make clear the connection between the two pages&amp;nbsp;;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;but the catchword is now out of use, and it is not missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource

'''''Chinoiserie''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ʃ|ɪ|n|ˈ|w|ɑː|z|ər|i|}}, {{IPA-fr|ʃinwazʁi|lang}}; [[loanword]] from French ''[[wikt:chinoiserie#French|chinoiserie]]'', from ''[[wikt:chinois#French|chinois]]'', "Chinese") is the [[Europe]]an interpretation and imitation of [[China|Chinese]] and [[East Asia]]n artistic traditions, especially in the [[decorative arts]], [[garden design]], [[architecture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31805?redirectedFrom=Chinoiserie#eid9510224|title = Chinois|publisher = [[The Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic of Chinoiserie has been expressed in different ways depending on the region. Its acknowledgement derives from the current of [[Orientalism]], which studied Far East cultures from a historical, philological, anthropological, philosophical and religious point of view. First appearing in the 17th century, this trend was popularized in the 18th century due to the rise in trade with China and East Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Whispers: Chinoiserie in Britain, 1650–1930|last = Beevers|first = David|publisher = Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums|year = 2009|isbn = 0-948723-71-8|location = Brighton|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a style, chinoiserie is related to the [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-chinoiserie/|title=Style Guide: Chinoiserie|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Digital Media|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|date=|website=www.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both styles are characterized by exuberant decoration, asymmetry, a focus on materials, and stylized nature and subject matter that focuses on leisure and pleasure. Chinoiserie focuses on subjects that were thought by [[colonialism|colonial-era]] Europeans to be typical of [[Chinese culture]].

Chinoiserie entered European art and decoration in the mid-to-late 17th century; the work of [[Athanasius Kircher#Sinology|Athanasius Kircher]] influenced the study of [[orientalism]]. The popularity of chinoiserie peaked around the middle of the 18th century when it was associated with the [[rococo]] style and with works by [[François Boucher]], [[Thomas Chippendale]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement|Jean-Baptist Pillement.]] It was also popularized by the influx of Chinese and Indian goods brought annually to Europe aboard [[East India Company|English]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Swedish East India Company|Swedish East India Companies]].Though chinoiserie never fully went out of fashion, it declined in Europe by the 1760s when the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style gained popularity, though remained popular in the newly formed United States through the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} There was a revival of popularity for chinoiserie in Europe and the United States from the mid-19th century through the 1920s, and today in elite interior design and fashion.

Though usually understood as a European style, chinoiserie was a global phenomenon. Local versions of chinoiserie were developed in India, Japan, Persia, and particularly Latin America. Through the [[Manila Galeon Trade|Manila Galleon Trade]], Spanish traders brought large amounts of Chinese porcelain, lacquer, textiles, and spices from Chinese merchants based in [[Manila]] to New Spanish markets in Acapulco, Panama, and [[Lima]]. Those products then inspired local artists and artisans such as ceramicists making [[Talavera pottery]] at Puebla de Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/made-in-the-americas-the-new-world-discovers-asia/oclc/916494129|title=Made in the Americas: the new world discovers Asia|last=Carr|first=Dennis|last2=Bailey|first2=Gauvin A|last3=Brook|first3=Timothy|last4=Codding|first4=Mitchell|last5=Corrigan|first5=Karina|last6=Pierce|first6=Donna|last7=Museum of Fine Arts|first7=Boston|date=2015-01-01|isbn=978-0-87846-812-6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularization ==
There were many reasons why chinoiserie gained such popularity in Europe in the 18th century.  Europeans had a fascination with the exotic East due to their increased, but still restricted, access to new cultures through expanded trade with East Asia, especially China. The limited number of European first-hand experiences of East Asia and their restricted circulation created a level of mystification and misinformation that contributed to the mystification of East Asian cultures.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The 'China' indicated in the term 'Chinoiserie' represented in European people's mind a wider region of the globe that could embrace China itself, but also Japan, Korea, South-East Asia, India or even Persia. In art, the style of the Orient was considered a source of inspiration; the atmosphere rich in images and the harmonic designs of the oriental style reflected the picture of an ideal world, from which to draw ideas in order to reshape one own's culture. For this reason the style of Chinoiserie is to be regarded as an important result of the exchange between the West and the East. During the 19th century, and especially in its latter period, the style of Chinoiserie was assimilated under the generic definition of [[exoticism]].&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"&gt;張省卿 ([[Sheng-Ching Chang]])，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 37–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the root of the word 'Chinoiserie' is 'Chine' (China), the Europeans of the 17th and 18th centuries didn't have a clear conceptualization of how China was in reality. Often terms like 'Orient', 'Far East' or 'China' were all equally used to signify the region of Eastern Asia that had proper Chinese culture as a major representative, but the meaning of the term could change according to different contexts. Sir William Chambers for example, in his oeuvre A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening of 1772, generically addresses China as the 'Orient'.&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"/&gt;  In the financial records of Louis XIV during the 17th and 18th centuries were already registered expressions like 'façon de la Chine', Chinese manner, or 'à la chinoise', made in the Chinese way. In the 19th century the term 'Chinoiserie' appeared for the first time in French literature. In the novel ''[https://fr.wikipedia.ord/wiki/L'Interdiction L'Interdiction]'' published in 1836, Honoré de Balzac used Chinoiserie to refer to the craftworks made in the Chinese style. From this moment on the term gained momentum and started being used more frequently to mean objects produced in the Chinese style but sometimes also to indicate graceful objects of small dimension or of scarce account. In 1878 'Chinoiserie' entered formally in the [[:fr:Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|Dictionnaire de l'Académie]].&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"/&gt;

After the spread of [[Marco Polo|Marco Polo's narrations]], the knowledge of China held by the Europeans continued to derive essentially from reports made by merchants and diplomatic envoys. Dating from the latter half of the 17th century a relevant role in this exchange of information was then taken up by the Jesuits, whose continual gathering of missionary intelligence and language transcription gave the European public a new deeper insight of the Chinese empire and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;張省卿 ([[Sheng-Ching Chang]])，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Europeans frequently held inaccurate ideas about East Asia, this did not necessarily preclude their fascination and respect.  In particular, the Chinese who had "exquisitely finished art... [and] whose court ceremonial was even more elaborate than that of Versailles" were viewed as highly civilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chinoiserie|last = Mayor|first = A. Hyatt|date = 1941|journal = The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Voltaire]] in his ''Art de la Chine'', "The fact remains that four thousand years ago, when we did not know how to read, they [the Chinese] knew everything essentially useful of which we boast today."&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire ''as qtd. in'' Lovejoy, Arthur. (1948) ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (1948). Johns Hopkins U. Press. 1978 edition: {{ISBN|0-313-20504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, somewhere, on the other side of the world, there existed a culture so rich that it rivaled the civilizations of Rome and Greece. Chinoiserie created a juxtaposition between something new and exotic for Europeans while at the same time reflecting the values of the 4,000 year old culture from which these objects came.

Chinoiserie was not universally popular. Some critics saw the style as "…a retreat from reason and taste and a descent into a morally ambiguous world based on hedonism, sensation and values perceived to be feminine."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was viewed as lacking the logic and reason upon which Antique art had been founded. Architect and author [[Robert Morris (writer)|Robert Morris]] claimed that it "…consisted of mere whims and chimera, without rules or order, it requires no fertility of genius to put into execution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Those with a more archaeological view of the East, considered the chinoiserie style, with its distortions and whimsical approach, to be a mockery of the actual Chinese art and architecture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Finally, still others believed that an interest in chinoiserie indicated a pervading "cultural confusion" in European society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interracial Encounters: Reciprocal Representations in African and Asian American Literatures, 1896–1937|last = Lee|first = Julia H.|publisher = NYU Press|year = 2011|isbn = 0-8147-5257-8|location = New York|pages = 114–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persistence after the 18th century ==
[[File:Rex Whistler - Wallpaper in the Chinoiserie Style, with a Picture Frame as its Central Motif 1932.jpg|thumb|Wallpaper in the chinoiserie style, with a picture frame as its central motif, [[Rex Whistler]]]]

Chinoiserie persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries but declined in popularity. There was a notable loss of interest in Chinese-inspired décor after the death in 1830 of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV,]] a great proponent of the style. The [[First Opium War]] of 1839–1842 between Britain and China disrupted trade and caused a further decline of interest in the Oriental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Opium, Soldiers and Evangelicals: England's 1840–42 War with China and its Aftermath|last = Gelber|first = Harry G|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-4039-0700-4|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; China closed its doors to exports and imports and for many people chinoiserie became a fashion of the past.

As British-Chinese relations stabilized towards the end of the 19th century, there was a revival of interest in chinoiserie. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], for example, reallocated many chinoiserie works from George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton to the more accessible Buckingham Palace. Chinoiserie served to remind Britain of its former colonial glory that was rapidly fading with the modern era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chinese porcelain ==
[[File:MediciPorcelainBottle1.png|thumb|200px|right|A Medici porcelain bottle held in the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. The Casino of San Marco's porcelain manufactory was one of the oldest successful attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in European history.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372403/Medici-porcelain |title=Medici porcelain |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of [[Chinese export porcelain]] (and for that matter [[Japanese export porcelain]] - Europeans were generally vague as the origin of "oriental" imports), with only partial success. One of the earliest successful attempts, for instance, was the [[Medici porcelain]] manufactured in Florence during the late-16th century, as the Casino of San Marco remained open from 1575–1587.&lt;ref name="britannica1" /&gt; Despite never being commercial in nature, the next major attempt to replicate Chinese porcelain was the [[soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] manufactory at [[Rouen manufactory|Rouen]] in 1673, with Edme Poterat, widely reputed as creator of the French soft-paste pottery tradition, opening his own factory in 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510765/Rouen-ware |title=Rouen ware &amp;#124; pottery |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were eventually made to imitate [[hard-paste porcelain]], which were held in high regard. As such, the direct imitation of Chinese designs in [[faience]] began in the late 17th century, was carried into European porcelain production, most naturally in tea wares, and peaked in the wave of rococo chinoiserie (c. 1740–1770).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Earliest hints of chinoiserie appear in the early 17th century, in the arts of the nations with active East India Companies, [[Dutch East India Company|Holland]] and [[British East India Company|England]], then by the mid-17th century, in Portugal as well. [[Tin-glazed pottery]] (see ''[[delftware]]'') made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine blue-and-white [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] decoration from the early 17th century. After a book by [[Johan Nieuhof]] was published the 150 pictures encouraged chinoiserie, and became especially popular in the 18th century. Early ceramic wares in [[Meissen porcelain]] and other factories naturally imitated Chinese designs, though the shapes for "useful wares", table and tea wares, typically remained Western, often based on shapes in silver.  Decorative wares such as vases followed  Chinese shapes.

== Painting ==
The ideas of the decorative and pictorial arts of the East permeated the European and American arts and craft scene. For example, in the United States, "by the mid-18th century, Charleston had imported an impressive array of Asian export luxury goods [such as]...paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Leath, R. A.. (1999). "After the Chinese Taste": Chinese Export Porcelain and Chinoiserie Design in Eighteen-Century Charleston. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25616724 Historical Archaeology]'', ''33''(3), 48–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The aspects of Chinese painting that were integrated into European and American visual arts include asymmetrical compositions, lighthearted subject matter and a general sense of capriciousness.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[William Alexander (painter)|William Alexander]] (1767–1816), a British painter, illustrator and engraver who traveled to the East Asia and China in the 18th century, was directly influenced by the culture and landscape he saw in the East.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinoiserie: Commerce and Critical Ornament in Eighteenth-Century Britain|last = Sloboda|first = Stacey|publisher = Manchester UP|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-7190-8945-9|location = New York|pages = 29, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented an idealized, romanticized depiction of Chinese culture, but he was influenced by "pre-established visual signs."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the Chinoiserie landscapes that Alexander depicted accurately reflected the landscape of China, "paradoxically, it is this imitation and repetition of the iconic signs of China that negate the very possibility of authenticity, and render them into stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The depiction of China and East Asia in European and American painting was dependent on the understanding of the East by Western preconceptions, rather than representations of Eastern culture as it actually was.

== Interior design ==

Various European monarchs, such as [[Louis XV of France]], gave special favor to chinoiserie, as it blended well with the [[rococo]] style.  Entire rooms, such as those at [[Château de Chantilly]], were painted with chinoiserie compositions, and artists such as [[Antoine Watteau]] and others brought expert craftsmanship to the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/glossaryindex.htm?http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/data/chinoiserie.shtml|title=chinoiserie|author=Jan-Erik Nilsson|publisher=Gothenborg.com|accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central European palaces like the Castle of Wörlitz or the Castle of Pillnitz all include rooms decorated with Chinese features, while in the palace of Sanssouci at Potsdam features a Dragon House (Das Drachenhaus) and the Chinese House (Das Chinesische Haus).&lt;ref&gt;張省卿 (Sheng-Ching Chang)，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German and Russian palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Chinese Village]]s were built in the mountainous park of Wilhelmshöhe near Kassel, Germany; in [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]], [[Sweden]] and [[Tsarskoe Selo]], [[Russia]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70, but sober ''homages'' to early [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream chinoiserie. Chinoiserie media included "japanned" ware imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated [[japanning]], early painted wallpapers in sheets, after [[engraving]]s by [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement]], and ceramic figurines and table ornaments.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Europeans began to manufacture furniture that imitated Chinese lacquer furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/east-asian-lacquer-influence|title=V&amp;A · The influence of East Asian lacquer on European furniture|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently decorated with ebony and ivory or Chinese motifs such as pagodas. [[Thomas Chippendale]] helped to popularize the production of Chinoiserie furniture with the publication of his design book ''The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director: Being a large Collection of the Most Elegant and Useful Designs of Household Furniture, In the Most Fashionable Taste.'' His designs provided a guide for intricate chinoiserie furniture and its decoration. His chairs and cabinets were often decorated with scenes of colorful birds, flowers, or images of exotic imaginary places. The compositions of this decoration were often asymmetrical.

The increased use of wallpaper in European homes in the 18th century also reflects the general fascination with Chinoiserie motifs. With the rise of the villa and a growing taste for sunlit interiors, the popularity of wallpaper grew. [[John Cornforth (historian)|John Cornforth]] notes{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} that previously the "light-absorbing textures of tapestry, velvet, and damask" were preferred, but now the general interest was in light-reflecting decoration. The demand for wallpaper created by Chinese artists began first with European aristocrats between 1740 and 1790.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Wallpaper and its History|last = Entwistle|first = E. A.|date = 1961|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 450–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The luxurious wallpaper available to them would have been unique, handmade, and expensive.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Later wallpaper with chinoiserie motifs became accessible to the middle class when it could be printed and thus produced in a range of grades and prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Behind Closed Doors|last = Vickery|first = Amanda|publisher = Yale UP|year = 2009|isbn = 0-300-16896-9|location = New Haven, CT|pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patterns on Chinoiserie wallpaper are similar to the pagodas, floral designs, and exotic imaginary scenes found on chinoiserie furniture and porcelain. Like chinoiserie furniture and other decorative art forms, chinoiserie wallpaper was typically placed in bedrooms, closets, and other private rooms of a house. The patterns on wallpaper were expected to complement the decorative objects and furniture in a room, creating a complementary backdrop.

== Architecture and gardens ==
European understanding of Chinese and East Asian garden design is exemplified by the use of the word ''[[Sharawadgi]]'', understood as beauty, without order that takes the form of an aesthetically pleasing irregularity in landscape design. The word traveled together with imported lacquer ware from Japan where ''shara'aji'' was an idiom in appraisal of design in decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Japanese Art, Aesthetics, and a European Discourse: Unraveling Sharawadgi|last = Kuitert|first = Wybe|date = 2014|journal = Japan Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 78|volume = 27}}[http://ngjs.nl/files/artikelen/2014_Unraveling_Sharawadgi_Kuitert.pdf Online as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Temple]] (1628–1699), referring to such artwork, introduces the term sharawadgi in his essay ''Upon the Gardens of Epicurus'' written in 1685 and published in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;William Temple. "Upon the Gardens of Epicurus; or Of Gardening in the Year 1685." In Miscellanea, the Second Part, in Four Essays. Simpson, 1690&lt;/ref&gt; Under Temple's influence European gardeners and landscape designers used the concept of sharawadgi to create gardens that were believed to reflect the asymmetry and naturalism present in the gardens of the East.

These gardens often contain various fragrant plants, flowers and trees, decorative rocks, ponds or lake with fish, and twisting pathways. They are frequently enclosed by a wall. Architectural features placed in these gardens often include pagodas, ceremonial halls used for celebrations or holidays, pavilions with flowers and seasonal elements.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Ruru (2015). "Chinese Gardens". ''China Highlights''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscapes such as London's [[Kew Gardens]] show distinct Chinese influence in architecture. A monumental 163-foot pagoda in the center of the garden designed and built by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] exhibits strong English architectural elements, resulting in a product of combined cultures (Bald, 290). A replica of it was built in [[Munich]]'s [[Englischer Garten]], while the Chinese Garden of Oranienbaum include another pagoda and also a Chinese teahouse.  Though the rise of a more serious approach in [[Neoclassicism]] from the 1770s onward tended to replace Oriental inspired designs, at the height of Regency "Grecian" furnishings, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] came down with a case of [[Brighton Pavilion]], and Chamberlain's [[Royal Worcester|Worcester china]] manufactory imitated "[[Imari porcelain|Imari]]" wares.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} While classical styles reigned in the parade rooms, upscale houses, from [[Badminton House]] (where the "Chinese Bedroom" was furnished by [[John Linnell|William and John Linnell]], ca 1754) and [[Nostell Priory]] to [[Casa Loma]] in Toronto, sometimes featured an entire guest room decorated in the chinoiserie style, complete with Chinese-styled bed, [[fenghuang|phoenix]]-themed wallpaper, and [[porcelain|china]]. Later exoticisms added imaginary Turkish themes, where a [[Divan (furniture)|"diwan"]] became a [[couch|sofa]].

== Tea ==
One of the things that contributed to the popularity of chinoiserie was the 18th-century vogue for tea drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/04/07/396664685/tea-tuesdays-how-tea-sugar-reshaped-the-british-empire|title=Tea Tuesdays: How Tea + Sugar Reshaped The British Empire|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine and domestic culture of drinking tea required an appropriate ''chinoiserie mise en scène''. According to Beevers, "Tea drinking was a fundamental part of polite society; much of the interest in both Chinese export wares and chinoiserie rose from the desire to create appropriate settings for the ritual of tea drinking."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After 1750, England was importing 10,000,000 pounds of tea annually, demonstrating how widespread this practice was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = English Tea Caddy|last = Fisher|first = Reka N.|date = 1979|journal = Bulletin (St. Louis Art Museum)|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 174|volume = 15.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taste for chinoiserie porcelain, both export wares and European imitations, and tea drinking was more associated with women than men. A number of aristocratic and socially important women were famous collectors of chinoiserie porcelain, among them Queen Mary, Queen Anne, Henrietta Howard, and the Duchess of Queensbury, all socially important women. This is significant because their homes served as examples of good taste and sociability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth-century_studies/v035/35.3porter.html|title = Monstrous Beauty: Eighteenth-Century Fashion and the Aesthetics of the Chinese Taste.|last = Porter|first = David L.|date = 2002|journal = American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = September 20, 2015|pages = 395–411|volume = 53.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single historical incident in which there was a "keen competition between Margaret, 2nd Duchess of Portland, and Elizabeth, Countess of Ilchester, for a Japanese blue and white plate,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eastern Trade and the Furnishing of the British Country House|last = Impey|first = Oliver|date = 1989|journal = Studies in the History of Art|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 181|series = Symposium Papers X: The Fashioning and Functioning of the British Country House|volume = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how wealthy female consumers asserted their purchasing power and their need to play a role in creating the prevailing vogue.

== Literary criticism ==
The term is also used in literary criticism to describe a mannered "Chinese-esque" style of writing, such as that employed by [[Ernest Bramah]] in his [[Kai Lung]] stories, [[Barry Hughart]] in his ''Master Li &amp; Number Ten Ox'' novels and [[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]] in his [[Chia Black Dragon]] series.&lt;ref&gt;Marley rejects the chinoiserie label in favour of his own term, "Chinese Gothic".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
The term is also used in the [[fashion]] industry to describe "designs in textiles, fashion, and the decorative arts that derive from Chinese styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion |last=Calasibetta |first=Charlotte Mankey |author2=Tortora, Phyllis |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Fairchild Publications|Fairchild Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-56367-973-5 |page= |url=http://fairchildpub.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/fashion-dictionary-sample1.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coast Salish art''' is an art unique to the Pacific [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] among the [[Coast Salish peoples]]. Coast Salish are peoples from the Pacific Northwest Coast made up of many different languages and cultural characteristics. Coast Salish territory covers the coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state.  Within traditional Coast Salish art there are two major forms; the flat design and carving, and basketry and weaving.  In historical times these were delineated among male and female roles in the community with men made "figurative pieces, such as sculptures and paintings that depicts crest, shamanic beings, and spirits, whereas women produced baskets and textiles, most often decorated with abstract designs."&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p22&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The settlement of non-natives in this region was one of the first for the Pacific Northwest Coast which brought early cultural disruptions much sooner and faster than most of the coast. This made it so a limited quantity of ancient artifacts of the art form were produced, especially compared to amount that exists about other Northwest Coastal art.&lt;ref name="Jonaitis, Aldona 2006"&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coast Salish lived in shed-roofed [[longhouse]]s, large dwellings made from [[western red cedar|cedar]] planks and beams, with large extended families living within the house. Platforms around on the inside stood 3 or 4 feet above ground against the wall and were used as sleeping areas.  Sometimes large beams on the sides of the longhouse called "House Posts" would be carved or painted depicting [[ancestor]]s, [[family history]], or [[supernatural being]]s.  Some longhouses grew to enormous sizes such as one [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] described in his visit with [[Sto:lo]] people with a house measuring 640 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] long and 60 feet wide&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p71&lt;/ref&gt; or another [[Squamish people|Squamish]] longhouse measuring 200 feet long by 60 feet wide where 11 families lived in the house, numbering around 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;Barman, Jean. ''Stanley Park's Secret''. Harbour Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-55017-420-5}}. p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Coast Salish in the central region, the sxwayxwey (Sx̱wáýx̱way or Skwayskway in other languages) [[mask]] ceremony is an important part of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 75&lt;/ref&gt;  Men from families who have the hereditary right to be initiated into the sxwayxwey society and wear the mask, and perform dance with the addition of women singers and a special song.  The masks themselves have budged out cylindrical eyeballs, "horns" represented by animal heads, and drooping tongues with large feathers creating a dynamic crown.  They are accompanied by special [[regalia]] covered with [[feather]]s and [[leggings]] with [[hoof]] rattles attached.

[[Image:Skwxwu7mesh Siiyamiyn.jpg|thumb|left|Squamish leaders in 1903 are wearing traditional mountain-goat wool blankets.  These blankets show the different designs and patterns woven.]]Wool from the [[mountain goat]] and [[Salish Wool Dog]], now extinct, were used to craft wool woven mats, blankets, clothing, and robes.  The wool would be taken from the animals and then mixed with a [[diatomaceous earth]] removing oils and adding a white colour.  After wetting, the wool would be twisted between the palm and thigh to create a loose strand, after which was spun.  Whorls were placed on the shafts of wood [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s, and the loose strands of wool were spun. Some of the circular spindle whorls were plain, but others had elaborate designs and beings depicted.

[[Image:WHORL WOMAN.gif|thumb|Here a Squamish elder woman is spinning wool on spindle-whorl c. 1893]][[Blanket]]s, [[mat]]s, and [[robe]]s were woven on [[loom]]s which were made up of two upright bars and were attached to two horizontal rollers.  Some loom poles were also carved with figures illustrating supernatural characters or family history.  Specially designed [[comb]]s were used during the process of preparing the wool, and another tool pushed the [[weft]] during [[weaving]].  Although the smaller textiles were often functional, many larger robes served as indicators of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Men carved house posts, grave monuments, masks, and ritual paraphernalia such as rattles; while women crafted woven robes, some plain, some elaborately coloured. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s made from sheets of mountain-goat horn bent and then sewn to form volumetric triangles originally adorned with strands of mountain-goat wool. The art form is used in spindle whorls, house posts, welcome figures, combs, bent wood boxes, canoes, and other cultural objects.

=== Revival ===
Coast Salish art has undergone a revival in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-150247/susan-point-people-amongst-people Laurence, Robin.

[[Cowichan peoples|Cowichan]] artist Edward Joe, who has adapted the Coast Salish art form into fine jewelry and prints, says "(Coast) Salish art has as smooth slowing motion intended to create a calm mood. The stories, legends, and myths are depicted in many of my art pieces.

On October 24, 2008, the [[Seattle Art Museum]] opened "''S'abadeb—The Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists''", a Coast Salish art exhibition from 75 works of art from national and international collections of both traditional and contemporary artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/exhibitDetail.asp?eventID=13771# S'abadeb—The Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202094154/http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/exhibitDetail.asp?eventID=13771 |date=2008-12-02 }} - Retrieved November 09, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
It also differs from other [[Northwest Coast art]] in that it is more minimalist and straight forward. A belief in the overexposure of spirit images would weaken the spiritual powers of the beings portrayed, and as a result very few pieces were produced.&lt;ref name="Jonaitis, Aldona 2006"/&gt;

The "simplicity, antiquity, limited quantity and sometimes impenetrable iconography of (Coast) Salish art" have led to dismiss it in comparison to neighbor art forms, but Aldona Jonaitis in ''Art of the Northwest Coast'' remarks "Coast Salish art, like that of other Northwest Coast groups, responds to the social needs for which the archaic style was well suited... Coast Salish art cannot be judged according to alien values appropriate to other Northwest Coast groups, but, like most kinds of art, must be understood as visual statements meaningful and valuable to their creators."&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona.

The '''''Communion of the Apostles''''', or '''''Institution of the Eucharist''''' is a painting of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Federico Barocci]] located at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome. It was commissioned for the family chapel of [[Pope Clement VIII]] Aldobrandini and completed between 1603 and 1608.&lt;ref name=Apostasy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=The apostasy of Michelangelo in a painting by Federico Barocci|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=Spring 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=27–34|jstor=23206723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was most likely the sight of Barocci's ''Presentation of the Virgin'' in the Chiesa Nuova at its unveiling in 1603 that led to the commission of the ''Communion'' four months later. On 13 August 1603 the pope communicated with the minister to [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere]], duke of Urbino, Giacomo Sorbolongo, about acquiring an altarpiece from Barocci.{{efn|Stasera uerso il tardi il Papa mi ha fatto chiamare, et quando sono stato dent'ro, mi ha detto ridendo, che se bene era cosa leggieri, per la quale mi hauea fatto dimandare, era per'o un suo gusto et seguit'o, come fa fabricare una Capella qui nella Minerua in memoria de' suoi, Padre, Madre et fratelli, et desiderando, che nell'altare di essa ci fosse il quadro fatto da uallente huomo, se bene qui ce ne sono et in particulare ha Iseppino, non dimeno si sodisfarebbe assai hauerlo di mano del Baroccio.}} At this time the [[Cavaliere d'Arpino]] was the pope's most important artist; the letter goes on to ask that d'Arpino not be told of the commission.{{efn|desidera non si sappia da altri tal pratica, massime per rispetto d'Iseppino}}&lt;ref name=Verstegen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=Federico Barocci, Federico Borromeo, and the Oratorian Orbit|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2003|volume=56|issue=1|pages=56–87|doi=10.2307/1262258|jstor=1262258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffael 066.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Detail from the ''School of Athens'', Michelangelo as Heraclitus]]
The commission was completed entirely in [[Urbino]] and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by [[Cherubino Alberti]] with a ''Triumph of the Holy Cross''.&lt;ref name=Emiliani&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emiliani|first1=Andrea|title=Federico Barocci (Urbino 1535-1612)|date=1985|publisher=Nuova Alfa Editoriale|location=Bologna|pages=376–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches.&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|last2=Wohl|first2=Alice Sedgwick|last3=Wohl|first3=Hellmut|last4=Montanari|first4=Tomaso|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521781879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design,&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene.&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Thomas|title=Color and the Exchange of Ideas between Patron and Artist in Renaissance Italy|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2000|volume=82|issue=2|pages=298–308|doi=10.2307/3051378|jstor=3051378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barocci quotes from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' by inserting the portrait of [[Heraclitus]], which many believe is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]]. Significantly, he depicts [[Judas Iscariot]] using Michelangelo's portrait.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Morten Steen|title=In Michelangelo's Mirror|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271056401|pages=148–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUI9xD9ghpgC|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt;

Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler ''Crucifixion'' (Museo del Prado, Madrid).&lt;ref name=Spear&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spear|first1=Richard|title=Scrambling for Scudi: Notes on Painters' Earnings in Early Baroque Rome|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=310–320|doi=10.2307/3177346|jstor=3177346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural materialism''' in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]] traces its origin to the work of the [[left-wing]] literary critic [[Raymond Williams]]. Cultural materialism makes analysis based in [[critical theory]], in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 

==Overview==
Cultural materialism emerged as a theoretical movement in the early 1980s along with [[new historicism]], an American approach to [[early modern]] literature, with which it shares much common ground. The term was coined by Williams, who used it to describe a theoretical blending of leftist culturalism and [[Marxist]] analysis. Cultural materialists deal with specific historical documents and attempt to analyze and recreate the zeitgeist of a particular moment in history. 

Williams viewed culture as a "productive process", part of the [[means of production]], and cultural materialism often identifies what he called "residual", "emergent" and "oppositional" cultural elements. Following in the tradition of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and others, cultural materialists extend the [[Social class|class]]-based analysis of traditional [[Marxism]] ([[Neo-Marxism]]) by means of an additional focus on the [[marginalized]].

Cultural materialists analyze the processes by which [[hegemony|hegemonic]] forces in society appropriate canonical and historically important texts, such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Jane Austen|Austen]], and utilize them in an attempt to validate or inscribe certain values on the cultural [[Imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]. [[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], authors of ''[[Political Shakespeare]]'', have had considerable influence in the development of this movement and their book is considered to be a seminal text. They have identified four defining characteristics of cultural materialism as a theoretical device:
* Historical context
* Close textual analysis
* Political commitment
* Theoretical method

Cultural materialists seek to draw attention to the processes being employed by contemporary power structures, such as the church, the state or the academy, to disseminate [[ideology]]. To do this they explore a text’s historical context and its political implications, and then through close textual analysis note the dominant hegemonic position. They identify possibilities for the rejection and/or subversion of that position. British critic [[Graham Holderness]] defines cultural materialism as a "politicized form of historiography".

Through its insistence on the importance of an engagement with issues of [[gender]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], cultural materialism has had a significant impact on the field of literary studies, especially in Britain. Cultural materialists have found the area of Renaissance studies particularly receptive to this type of analysis. Traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] readings often eschewed consideration of the oppressed and marginalized in textual readings, whereas cultural materialists routinely consider such groups in their engagement with literary texts, thus opening new avenues of approach to issues of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in the field of literary criticism.

The '''''Desert Breath''''', located in the [[Egypt]]ian desert near [[Hurghada]] on the [[Red Sea]] coast, is a double-[[spiral]] work of [[land art]].

It was created by the D.A.ST. Arteam, a group made up of three Greek artists - [[Danae Stratou]], sculptor, [[Alexandra Stratou]], industrial designer, and [[Stella Constantinides]], architect. The work, completed on March 7, 1997, covers an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 89 protruding cones of gradually increasing size set in a spiral and another 89 depressed (incised) cones set in spirals. The sand dug out from the depressed cones was used to create the protruding cones, resulting in the displacement of 8000 cubic meters (10500 cubic yards) of sand.  At the center of the art piece used to be a body of water 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter which has since evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is this an alien landing site, ancient monument, or something else?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/14/world/africa/alien-landing-site-desert/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artwork is subject to natural erosion and in due course the area will revert to original desert plain. It is viewable by satellite pictures via [[Google Earth]].

==Intention of the Project==
The artists have stated that the project was meant to suggest an experience of infinity with the desert as a landscape of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danaestratou.com/projects/exterior/desert-breath] Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though it is in a state of slow disintegration, Desert Breath is still viewable two decades after its creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  Through its slow disintegration, the installation has been seen as an instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipedia.org/landscape/desertbreath Desert Breath — archipedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''dihedral symmetry in three dimensions''' is one of three infinite sequences of [[point groups in three dimensions]] which have a [[symmetry group]] that as abstract group is a [[dihedral group]] Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 ).

== Types==
There are 3 types of dihedral symmetry in three dimensions, each shown below in 3 notation: [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] notation, [[Coxeter notation]], and [[orbifold notation]].

;Chiral:
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [''n'',2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (22''n'') of order 2''n'' – '''dihedral symmetry''' or '''para-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[Dihedral group|''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']])
;Achiral:
*''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', [''n'',2], (*22''n'') of order 4''n'' – '''prismatic symmetry''' or '''full ortho-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' × ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''D&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;''), [2''n'',2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*''n'') of order 4''n'' – '''antiprismatic symmetry''' or '''full gyro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)

For a given ''n'', all three have ''n''-fold [[rotational symmetry]] about one axis ([[rotation]] by an angle of 360°/''n'' does not change the object), and 2-fold about a perpendicular axis, hence about ''n'' of those. For ''n'' = ∞ they correspond to three [[frieze group]]s. [[Schoenflies notation|Schönflies notation]] is used,  with [[Coxeter notation]] in brackets, and [[orbifold notation]] in parentheses. The term horizontal (h) is used with respect to a vertical axis of rotation.

In 2D the symmetry group ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes reflections in lines. When the 2D plane is embedded horizontally in a 3D space, such a  reflection can either be viewed as the restriction to that plane of a reflection in a vertical plane, or as the restriction to the plane of a rotation about the reflection line, by 180°. In 3D the two operations are distinguished: the group ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains rotations only, not reflections. The other group is [[pyramidal symmetry]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the same order.

With [[reflection symmetry]] with respect to a plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold rotation axis we have ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' [n], (*22''n'').

''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''D&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;''), [2''n'',2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*''n'') has vertical mirror planes between the horizontal rotation axes, not through them. As a result the vertical axis is a 2''n''-fold [[rotoreflection]] axis.

''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] and also for a regular n-sided [[bipyramid]]. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[antiprism]], and also for a regular n-sided [[trapezohedron]]. ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group of a partially rotated prism.

''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is not included because the three symmetries are equal to other ones:
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 2 with a single 180° rotation
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1''h''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''v''&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 4 with a reflection in a plane and a 180° rotation through a line in that plane
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 4 with a reflection in a plane and a 180° rotation through a line perpendicular to that plane

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 there is not one main axes and two additional axes, but there are three equivalent ones.

*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (222) of order 4 is one of the three symmetry group types with the [[Klein four-group]] as abstract group. It has three perpendicular 2-fold rotation axes. It is the symmetry group of a [[cuboid]] with an S written on two opposite faces, in the same orientation.
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, [2,2], (*222) of order 8 is the symmetry group of a cuboid
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*2) of order 8 is the symmetry group of e.g.:
**a square cuboid with a diagonal drawn on one square face, and a perpendicular diagonal on the other one
**a regular [[tetrahedron]] scaled in the direction of a line connecting the midpoints of two opposite edges (''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup of [[tetrahedral symmetry|''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'']], by scaling we reduce the symmetry).

'''FOCAL International''' is the [[trade association]] representing [[Stock footage#Libraries|stock footage]] companies, [[post-production]] facilities and individuals involved in the use of [[stock footage|footage]], [[stock photography|still images]] and [[stock sound effect|audio]] in all forms of media production. It represents more than 300 companies and individuals involved in media production, asset management, preservation of historical archives, [[film restoration]] and [[post-production]].

==History==
FOCAL International was founded in 1985 by an international group of [[stock footage|library]] archive leaders, specialising in film, television and news content who knew each other largely through licensing film and television archives who felt that archive owners could financially benefit from commercially exploiting parts of their archives for secondary use by professional film and television producers. 
The high cost of Archive management, preservation and storage and the introduction of new formats was also endangering many film based collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States|first=Anthony|last=Slide|publisher=MacFarland &amp; Company Ltd|year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZIq5-_hu5cC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=jill+hawkins,+focal&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=jill%20hawkins%2C%20focal&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7864-0836-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders included Jill Hawkins from [[BBC Enterprises]] (now [[BBC Worldwide]]), Pam Turner of [[Visnews]], David Warner of [[ITN]], George Marshall of [[British Pathe]], Sten Frykholm from the Swedish broadcaster [[Svt|SVT]], Jacque Blanchard, from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and Patricia Gang of [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]. 
With the support of a close group of individuals from both BBC and Visnews including Alan Stoner, Jeremy Cantwell, David Wratten as well as researchers Kirsty MacCalman and Jane Mercer, FOCAL launched officially at MIPCOM in 1987.

Its first patron was [[David Puttnam|David (now Lord) Puttnam]], who became Chair of Patrons in 2005.

==Structure==
FOCAL International is run by a small administration team in the UK, reporting to an international Executive Council, comprising a Chair, and a number of representatives of member bodies.

FOCAL International seeks to implement its objectives through its [[committee]]s, which are made up of industry experts and representatives. These committees include: the Editorial Committee, responsible for the quarterly magazine "Archive Zones"; the Events &amp; Exhibitions Committee, responsible for organising the [[FOCAL International#FOCAL International Awards|FOCAL International Awards]], and FOCAL International’s presence at relevant trade and industry events; the Training Committee, responsible for providing and promoting training in the archive industry, and raising awareness of the need for preservation of archives; and the Funding &amp; Lobbying Committee, which lobbies governmental and institutional bodies on behalf of its members.

==FOCAL International Awards==
The FOCAL International Awards were established in 2004 to support and honour the researchers, technicians and producers who uncover, preserve and utilise archive footage in their work. The award ceremony is held annually in the spring in [[London]], UK.

The Awards cover categories for the best use of footage in factual productions, entertainment or drama, arts, music, sports, natural history and cinema, and also include categories for the best restoration or [[film preservation|preservation]] project, best [[Stock footage#Libraries|footage library]], best footage researcher of the year, and a Lifetime Achievement Award.

[[File:Focus puller.jpg|thumb|right|A focus puller]]
A '''focus puller''', or 1st assistant camera, is a member of a [[film crew]]'s camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain image [[Sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] on whatever subject or action is being filmed.

"Pulling focus" or "[[Racking focus|rack focusing]]" refers to the act of changing the [[Camera lens|lens]]'s focus distance setting in correspondence to a moving subject's physical distance from the focal plane.  For example, if an actor moves from 8m to 3m away from the focal plane within a shot, the focus puller will change the distance setting on the lens during the take in precise relation to the changing position of the actor.  Additionally, the focus puller may shift focus from one subject to another within the frame, as dictated by the specific requirements of the [[cinematic techniques|shot]].

A good focus puller will have an intimate knowledge of cinematographic and optical theory.  Depending on the parameters of a given shot, there is often very little room for error.  As such, the role of a focus puller is extremely important within the realm of a film production; a "soft" image will, in most circumstances, be considered unusable, since there is no way to fix such an error in post-production.  One must also consider that an actor may not be able to duplicate his or her best performance in a subsequent take, so the focus puller is expected to perform flawlessly on every take.  Because of these factors, some production personnel consider the focus puller to have the most difficult job on set.

British [[cinematographer]] [[Oliver Stapleton]] has written:
{{quote| The 1st AC (or Focus Puller) has one of the hardest jobs on the set. And it's one of those jobs that are never noticed until it is wrong. Then you get an almighty bollocking, or you get fired&amp;nbsp;... Focus Pulling not only involves what it sounds like, but also the Focus Puller "runs" the department, in the sense of taking care of all the camera gear, and making sure that everything is tickety-boo. I have my own camera, so it's treated very well! A focus puller relies heavily on the Operator to tell him if the shot is out of focus&amp;nbsp;— after all only the operator is actually looking through the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineman.co.uk/#camera |title=Camera Department |work=So You Wanna Work in Movies? |first=Oliver |last=Stapleton |accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During production, 1st ACs are also responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all camera equipment and accessories, including; lenses, filters, batteries, film magazines/recording media, matte boxes, etc., as well as  configuring the camera and its accessories in multiple ways for different setups. 1st ACs arrive on set before the director, [[director of photography]] (DoP) and [[camera operator]], and ensures the camera and all required lenses are prepared for the day's shoot.  During filming, the 1st AC is responsible for moving the camera to each setup as directed by the Director of Photography. On larger budget productions, the camera is usually mounted on a dolly for most of the day, which is operated by the Dolly Grip.  At the end of each shooting day, 1st ACs clean the equipment and pack it up in preparation for the next day. If there is a problem with the rushes (such as a scratch on the film), the focus puller communicates with the film lab to fix any faults with the camera or film stock.

==Focus pulling==
Sharp focus is fundamental to reproducing a realistic, appealing image, and a viewer's attention is automatically drawn to sharper areas. When done correctly, good pulling goes mostly unnoticed by the audience.

The shooting of a scene typically begins with a blocking rehearsal, in which the various actors' positions are established.  During the rehearsal, the 2nd AC lays tape marks on the floor at all points an actor pauses movement. The actors then leave set to go through hair and makeup, and stand-ins come in to take their places at these various positions for the purposes of lighting, framing, and focus-mark setting.  Once a camera position is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors' marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of grease pencil/pen marks on the focus barrel of the lens, and/or the marking disc on the follow focus device.  Using the stand-ins or 2nd AC, marks are checked through the viewfinder and/or the onboard monitor for accuracy.  Marks may be repositioned in order to provide specific framing desired, and the 1st AC must be aware of this and re-measure/re-set his marks accordingly.  Additionally, the 1st AC may have the 2nd AC lay down specific distance marks on the floor which will be referenced during the take as actors move between their marks, in order to assist in accurately adjusting the focus to the correct intermediate distances.

When the actors return to set, there is usually a rehearsal for camera in which the focus puller and operator will practice the shot and make sure everything has been set up properly. During a take, the focus puller modifies the focus based on the dialog, movement of the actors or subject, movement of the camera, the DoP's directions, and compensates on the fly for actors missing their marks or any unforeseen movement. In cases where an obstruction prevents the focus puller from seeing all his marks, he may request the 2nd AC call the marks for him over a 2-way radio during the shot.  In some situations, such as on long lenses, wide apertures, very close distances, or any combination of the three, a subject moving even a few millimeters may require immediate and very precise focus correction.

After a take, if the focus puller feels he's made a mistake—be it a  timing error, a missed mark, or any other issue which may have rendered some part of the take "soft," he or she will typically report this to the operator (who most likely noticed the error in the viewfinder) or director of photography, and may ask for another take if another wasn't already planned.

Traditionally, the focus puller used only his marks and his own well-developed sense of distance estimation to achieve good results.  Over the last decade, the increased use of digital cameras, higher-resolution [[video tap]]s and/or on-camera monitors have provided focus pullers with additional tools to help maintain proper focus. A high-definition monitor can be particularly useful when a fast-paced production simply does not allow time for the focus puller to set and check all marks that may be needed, or if no rehearsal will be provided.

Professional 1st ACs have many tricks for pulling focus in difficult situations or when accurate measurement is impossible.  Often, before a scene is even rehearsed or established, the 1st AC will take surveying measurements of the general environment in order to have a good idea of the distance between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements can be used to quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.

In addition to keen eyesight, reflexes, and intuition, the focus puller's primary tools are a cloth or fiberglass tape measure, steel tape measure, laser rangefinder, and in some cases an on-camera ultrasonic rangefinder which provides a real-time distance readout mounted on the side of the mattebox or camera body.  In setups where the focus puller cannot touch the camera, such as on steadicam or crane shots, he or she will use a remote follow focus system, though some focus pullers prefer using a remote system at all times.

==Other duties==
At the end of a successfully shot scene, the focus puller will be called upon to "Check the gate". This involves removing the lens and inspecting, with the aid of a flashlight and magnifying glass, the aperture to which the film is held during exposure. The focus puller is looking for any foreign bodies, e.g. hair, bits of broken film, fluff etc., that would show on the film and therefore ruin the scene that has just been filmed. This obviously is only relevant to shooting on film: however, a similar task is required for digital movie cameras (although not nearly as often) which involves checking the sensor.

The 1st AC reports to the [[director of photography]], works alongside the [[camera operator]], and oversees the [[Clapper loader|2nd assistant camera]] (also known as the "clapper loader") and any other members of the camera department.

'''For Freedoms''' is an artist-run platform for [[civic engagement]], discourse, and direct action for artists in the [[United States]]. Co-founded by [[Hank Willis Thomas]] and Eric Gottesman in 2016, For Freedoms has partnered with US-based institutions and artists for activations including Town Halls, exhibitions and installations, public programs, billboard campaigns, and artist residencies. In June 2018, For Freedoms launched the 50 State Initative, described as the 'largest-ever public art project in the US'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive Kickstarter campaign launched for 'largest-ever public art project in the US' with billboards across all 50 states|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/for-freedoms-launches-grassroots-campaign-for-nation-wide-civic-art-project|website=The Art Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Founding ===

Co-founded in 2016 by [[Hank Willis Thomas]], a photographer and conceptual artist, and Eric Gottesman, a video artist and activist, For Freedoms was inspired by [[Norman Rockwell]]'s paintings of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]’s “[[Four Freedoms]]” wartime address in [[1941]]—a call to safeguard the [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of worship]], [[freedom from want]], and [[freedom from fear]]. In January 2016 For Freedoms was registered as the first artist-run [[political action committee]] and began raising money for national advertising through the artistic collaboration ''Postcards from America'', a project of [[Magnum Foundation]] artists [[Jim Goldberg]], [[Gilles Peress]], and [[Alec Soth]]. The Postcards from America Photographs, as well as works from [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Rashid Johnson]], [[Xaviera Simmons]], [[Bayeté Ross Smith]], [[Fred Tomaselli]], and [[Marilyn Minter]], were exhibited at Jack Shainman Gallery in summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A ‘Super PAC’ Where Art Meets Politics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/arts/design/a-super-pac-where-art-meets-politics.html|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, outside of For Freedoms headquarters, a flag by [[Dread Scott]] was added to the show, drawing immense attention. Displayed outside the gallery in [[Manhattan]] on the week of the deaths of [[Philando Castile]] and [[Alton Sterling]], Scott sparked national conversation about [[police brutality]] by reinterpreting the early 1900s [[NAACP]] flag "A Man Was Lynched Yesterday,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Man Was Lynched Yesterday|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2015647092/|website=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; updating it to read "A Man Was Lynched By Police Yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does This Flag Make You Flinch?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/us/artist-flag-protests-lynching-by-police.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https:/www.google.com/|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Billboard Campaign===
For Freedoms released a national billboard campaign a month before [[Donald Trump]]'s election in October 2016. The organization commissioned artists for billboards in [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Flint, Michigan]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Pearl, Mississippi]]; [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Tallahassee, Florida]]; [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]; as well as billboards in November in [[Miami, Florida]] and [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. The billboard in Pearl, MS—which superimposed Donald Trump's Campaign slogan "[[Make America Great Again]] over [[Spider Martin]]'s image ''Two Minute Warning'' of [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]—incited local and national controversy. Then-governor [[Phil Bryant]] called the billboard imagery "reprehensible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/33739049/billboard-raises-eyebrows-in-rankin-county|title=Pearl billboard removed amid controversy|first=Bob|last=Burks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Pearl mayor Brad Rogers vied to have the billboard taken down, an action which raised questions over [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mississippi residents unsure of controversial billboard's intent|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/mississippi-billboard-make-america-great-again/|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 to 2018===
The initiative held residency at [[MoMA PS1]] for the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. ''Laboratory for Freedoms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Freedoms To Begin Residency at PS1|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/01/17/for-freedoms-to-begin-residency-at-ps1-controversial-make-america-great-again-billboard-goes-up/|website=ARTNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an activation space for public meetings, town halls, and performances. That summer, For Freedoms held an artist's workshop for [[MoMA]] and curated [[Aperture Foundation]]'s Summer Open exhibition ''On Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition Review: On Freedom at Aperture Gallery|url=http://museemagazine.com/culture/2017/8/2/exhibition-review-on-freedom-at-aperture-gallery|website=Musée}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the group continued doing town halls and billboards in collaboration with [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland]] and [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. 

In 2017, For Freedoms Federation, [[LLC]] was created to engage with educational partners in order to activate the cultural infrastructure of the country in the pursuit of social change. For Freedoms Federation acts as a hub for other artists, arts institutions, and activists who want to be more engaged with the current political system in all of the fifty states and Puerto Rico with the stated aim of making democracy more transparent and responsive. In 2018, all For Freedoms activation began operating under the Federation as opposed to the [[Political action committee|PAC]].

The '''griffin''', '''griffon''', or '''gryphon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: γρύφων, ''grýphōn'', or γρύπων, ''grýpōn'', early form ''γρύψ'', ''grýps''; {{lang-lat|gryphus}}) is a [[legendary creature]] with the body, tail, and [[hindlimb|back legs]] of a [[lion]]; the head and wings of an [[eagle]]; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle the king of birds by the Middle Ages the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, Griffins were known for guarding treasure and priceless possessions.&lt;ref name="friar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friar

In Greek and Roman texts, griffins and [[Arimaspi]]ans were associated with gold. Indeed, as Pliny the Elder wrote, "griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the grounds and these nests contained gold nuggets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayor, A. and Heaney, M.|title=Griffins and Arimaspeans|journal=Folklore|date=1993|volume=104|issue=1–2|page=40|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/0015587X.1993.9715853?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrienne Mayor]], a classical folklorist and historian of science, proposes that the idea and image of the griffin was influenced by the fossilized remains of the beaked dinosaur ''[[Protoceratops]]'' observed on the way to gold deposits by nomadic prospectors of ancient Scythia (Central Asia),&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Mayor, ''Archaeology Magazine'', November–December 1994, pp. 53–59; Mayor, ''The First Fossil Hunters'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is necessarily speculative, based on a number of Greek and Latin literary sources and related artworks, beginning with the first written ancient desciptions of griffins in a lost work by Aristeas of Proconnessus (a Greek who traveled to the Altai region between Mongolia and NW China) in the seventh century BC), cited by Aeschylus and Herodotus (ca 450 BC) and ending with Aelian (third century AD). Mayor's suggestion has been contested, with claims that it ignores pre-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] "accounts" and bird-lion composites in earlier art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Witton]], [http://markwitton-com.blogspot.pt/2016/04/why-protoceratops-almost-certainly.html Why Protoceratops Almost Certainly Wasn't The Inspiration For Griffin Legend]&lt;/ref&gt; But in fact no written accounts earlier than Herodotus exist to tell us anything about imaginary hybrid bird-lion imagery in earlier cultures. 

In medieval heraldry, the Griffin became a Christian [[symbol]] of [[divinity|divine power]] and a guardian of the divine.&lt;ref name="von volborth"&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==
[[File:Psa-Opera del Duomo-Grifone Islamico007.jpg|thumb|The [[Pisa Griffin]], in the [[Pisa Cathedral]] Museum, 11th century]]
The derivation of this word remains uncertain. It could be related to the Greek word γρυπός (grypos), meaning 'curved', or 'hooked'. Also, this could have been an Anatolian loan word, compare [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''karūbu'' (winged creature){{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, and similar to [[Cherub]]. A related Hebrew word is כרוב (''kerúv'').&lt;ref&gt;William H. C. Propp,''Exodus 19–40'', volume 2A of [[The Anchor Bible Series|''The Anchor Bible'']], New York: Doubleday, 2006, {{ISBN|0-385-24693-5}}, ''Notes'' to Exodus 15:18, page 386, referencing: [[Julius Wellhausen]], [[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels|''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'']], Edinburgh: Black, 1885, page 304. Also see: [[Robert S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', volume 1, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2010 {{ISBN|978-90-04-17420-7}}, page 289, entry for γρυπος, "From the archaeological perspective, origin in Asia Minor (and the Near East: Elam) is very probable."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
Most statuary representations of griffins depict them with bird-like [[claw|talons]], although in some older illustrations griffins have a lion's forelimbs; they generally have a lion's hindquarters. Its eagle's head is conventionally given prominent [[ear]]s; these are sometimes described as the lion's ears, but are often elongated (more like a [[horse]]'s), and are sometimes feathered.

Infrequently, a griffin is portrayed without wings, or a wingless eagle-headed lion is identified as a griffin. In 15th-century and later [[heraldry]], such a beast may be called an '''alce''' or a '''keythong'''.

In heraldry, a griffin always has forelegs like an eagle's hind-legs. A type of griffin with the four legs of a lion was distinguished by perhaps only one English herald of later heraldry as the '''Opinicus''', which also had a [[camel]]-like neck and a short tail that almost resembles a camel's tail.

In [[Central Asia]], the griffin appears about a thousand years after Bronze Age Crete, in the 5th–4th centuries BC, probably originating from the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. The Achaemenids considered the griffin "a protector from evil, witchcraft and secret slander".&lt;ref&gt;Neva, Elena. "[http://www.artwis.com/articles/central-asian-jewelry-and-their-symbols-in-ancient-time/ Central Asian Jewelry and their Symbols in Ancient Time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725171007/http://www.artwis.com/articles/central-asian-jewelry-and-their-symbols-in-ancient-time/ |date=25 July 2014 }}" Artwis; citing Pugachenkova, G. (1959) "Grifon v drevnem iskusstve central’noi Azii." ''Sovetskya Arheologia,'' 2 pp. 70, 83&lt;/ref&gt; The modern generalist calls it the lion-griffin, as for example, [[Robin Lane Fox]], in ''Alexander the Great,'' 1973:31 and notes p.&amp;nbsp;506, who remarks a lion-griffin attacking a stag in a pebble mosaic &lt;ref&gt;[http://greecefsp2009.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/dsc_0175.jpg Dartmouth College expedition]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Pella]], perhaps as an emblem of the kingdom of Macedon or a personal one of Alexander's successor [[Antipater]].

The [[Pisa Griffin]] is a large bronze sculpture that has been in [[Pisa]] in Italy since the Middle Ages, though it is of [[Islamic art|Islamic]] origin. It is the largest bronze medieval Islamic sculpture known, at over three feet tall (42.5&amp;nbsp;inches, or 1.08 m.), and was probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andaluz]] (Islamic Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; Hoffman, 318&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1100 it was placed on a column on the roof of [[Pisa Cathedral]] until replaced by a replica in 1832; the original is now in the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo (Cathedral Museum), Pisa.

===Ancient parallels===
Several ancient mythological creatures are similar to the griffin. These include the [[Lamassu]], an [[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] protective deity, often depicted with a bull or lion's body, eagle's wings, and human's head.

Sumerian and [[Akkadian mythology]] feature the demon [[Anzû (mythology)|Anzu]], half man and half bird, associated with the chief sky god [[Enlil]]. This was a divine storm-bird linked with the southern wind and the thunder clouds.

[[Jewish mythology]] speaks of the [[Ziz]], which resembles Anzu, as well as the ancient Greek [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]. The Bible mentions the Ziz in Psalms 50:11. This is also similar to [[Cherub]]. The cherub, or sphinx, was very popular in [[Phoenicia]]n iconography.

In [[ancient Crete]], griffins became very popular, and were portrayed in various media. A similar creature is the [[Minoan Genius]].

In the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religion, [[Garuda]] is a large bird-like creature which serves as a
[[Vahana|mount]] (''vahana'') of the Lord [[Vishnu]]. It is also the name for the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]].

==Medieval lore==
[[File:Venice - Statue of a griffin.jpg|thumb|Statue of a griffin at [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]]]
&lt;!--A 9th-century Irish writer by the name of Stephen Scotus asserted that griffins were strictly [[monogamy|monogamous]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}--&gt;

In legend, griffins not only mated for life, but if either partner died, then the other would continue the rest of its life alone, never to search for a new mate.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The griffin was thus made an emblem of the Church's opposition to [[marriage|remarriage]].{{Dubious|date=January 2012}} Being a union of an aerial bird and a terrestrial beast, it was seen in [[Christianity|Christendom]] to be a symbol of [[Jesus]], who was [[hypostatic union|both human and divine]]. As such it can be found sculpted on some churches.&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt;

According to Stephen Friar's ''New Dictionary of Heraldry'', a griffin's claw was believed to have [[medicine|medicinal]] properties and one of its feathers could restore [[visual perception|sight]] to the [[Blindness|blind]].&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt; Goblets fashioned from griffin claws (actually [[antelope]] horns) and griffin eggs (actually ostrich eggs) were highly prized in medieval European courts.&lt;ref name="bedingfeld"&gt;{{cite book

When [[Genoa]] emerged as a major seafaring power in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], griffins commenced to be depicted as part of the [[Republic of Genoa|republic's]] [[coat of arms]], rearing at the sides of the shield bearing the [[St George's Cross|Cross of St. George]].

By the 12th century, the appearance of the griffin was substantially fixed: "All its bodily members are like a lion's, but its wings and mask are like an eagle's."&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book

A '''[[hippogriff]]''' is a legendary creature, supposedly the offspring of a griffin and a mare.

In heraldry, the griffin's amalgamation of lion and eagle gains in courage and boldness, and it is always drawn to powerful fierce monsters. It is used to denote strength and military courage and leadership. Griffins are portrayed with the rear body of a lion, an eagle's head with erect ears, a feathered breast, and the forelegs of an eagle, including claws. These features indicate a combination of intelligence and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Oliver, ''Introduction to Heraldry''. David &amp; Charles, 2002. P. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In British heraldry, a male griffin is shown without wings, its body covered in tufts of formidable spikes, with a short tusk emerging from the forehead, as for a [[unicorn]].&lt;ref&gt;Male griffin depicted in Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 222, [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter of [[Earl of Carrick (Ireland)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The female griffin with wings is more commonly used.

==In architecture==
In [[architecture|architectural]] decoration the griffin is usually represented as a four-footed beast with wings and the head of an [[eagle]] with [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, or with the head and beak of an eagle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The statues that mark the entrance to the City of London are sometimes mistaken for griffins, but are in fact (Tudor) dragons, the supporters of the [[Flag of the City of London|city's arms]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040302214758/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/leisure_heritage/libraries_archives_museums_galleries/clro/pdf/cityarms.PDF The City Arms], City of London Corporation, hosted by webarchive&lt;/ref&gt; They are most easily distinguished from griffins by their membranous, rather than feathered, wings.

==In literature==
:''For fictional characters named Griffin, see [[Griffin (surname)]]''
[[Flavius Philostratus]] mentioned them in ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'':

{{quote|As to the gold which the griffins dig up, there are rocks which are spotted with drops of gold as with sparks, which this creature can quarry because of the strength of its beak. “For these animals do exist in India” he said, “and are held in veneration as being sacred to the Sun ; and the Indian artists, when they represent the Sun, yoke four of them abreast to draw the images ; and in size and strength they resemble lions, but having this advantage over them that they have wings, they will attack them, and they get the better of elephants and of dragons. But they have no great power of flying, not more than have birds of short flight; for they are not winged as is proper with birds, but the palms of their feet are webbed with red membranes, such that they are able to revolve them, and make a flight and fight in the air; and the tiger alone is beyond their powers of attack, because in swiftness it rivals the winds.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, volume I, book III.XLVIII., 1921, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|And the griffins of the Indians and the ants of the Ethiopians, though they are dissimilar in form, yet, from what we hear, play similar parts; for in each country they are, according to the tales of poets, the guardians of gold, and devoted to the gold reefs of the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, vol. II, book VI.I., 1921, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Griffins are used widely in [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]]; [[Rumi]] is one such poet who writes in reference to griffins.&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;''The Essential Rumi'', translated from [[Persian language|Persian]] by [[Coleman Barks]], p 257&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', after Dante and Virgil's journey through Hell and Purgatory has concluded, Dante meets a chariot dragged by a griffin in Earthly Paradise. Immediately afterwards, Dante is reunited with Beatrice. Dante and Beatrice then start their journey through Paradise.

[[Sir John Mandeville]] wrote about them in his 14th century book of travels:
{{quote|In that country be many griffins, more plenty than in any other country. Some men say that they have the body upward as an eagle and beneath as a lion; and truly they say sooth, that they be of that shape. But one griffin hath the body more great and is more strong than eight lions, of such lions as be on this half, and more great and stronger than an hundred eagles such as we have amongst us. For one griffin there will bear, flying to his nest, a great horse, if he may find him at the point, or two oxen yoked together as they go at the plough. For he hath his talons so long and so large and great upon his feet, as though they were horns of great oxen or of bugles or of kine, so that men make cups of them to drink of. And of their ribs and of the pens of their wings, men make bows, full strong, to shoot with arrows and quarrels.&lt;ref name=Mandeville&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Chapter XXIX, Macmillan and Co. edition, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Griffins appear in the fairy tales [[Jack the Giant Killer]], [[The Griffin (fairy tale)]] and [[The Singing, Springing Lark]].

In ''[[The Son of Neptune]]'' by [[Rick Riordan]], [[Percy Jackson]], [[Hazel Levesque]], and [[Frank Zhang]] are attacked by griffins in [[Alaska]].

In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, the character [[Albus Dumbledore]] has a griffin-shaped knocker. Also, the character [[Godric Gryffindor]]'s surname is a variation on the French ''griffon d'or'' ("golden griffon").

Pomponius Mela- "In Europe, constantly falling snow makes those places contiguous with the Riphean Mountains so impassable that, in addition, they prevent those who deliberately travel here from seeing anything. After that comes a region of very rich soil but quite uninhabitable because griffins, a savage and tenacious breed of wild beasts, love- to an amazing degree- the gold that is mined from deep within the earth there, and because they guard it with an amazing hostility to those who set foot there." (Romer, 1998.)

Isidore of Seville – "The Gryphes are so called because they are winged quadrupeds. This kind of wild beast is found in the Hyperborean Mountains. In every part of their body they are lions, and in wings and heads are like eagles, and they are fierce enemies of horses. Moreover they tear men to pieces." (Brehaut, 1912)

==Use for real animals==
Some large species of [[Old World vulture]]s are called griffines, including the [[griffon vulture]] (''Gyps fulvus''). The scientific name for the [[Andean condor]] is ''Vultur gryphus'', Latin for "griffin-vulture". The Catholic [[Douay Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] version of the Bible uses griffon for a creature referred to as vulture or ossifrage in other English translations (Leviticus 11:13).

==Origin==
A theory, postulated by [[Adrienne Mayor]], is that the griffin was influenced by observations and accounts brought back to the Mediterranean region by traders and travelers along the [[Silk Road]] from the Turfan Basin and western reaches of the [[Gobi Desert]] where white fossils of ''[[Protoceratops]]'' beaked dinosaurs continually weather out against reddish ground. Such fossils, seen by ancient observers, may have been interpreted as evidence of a half-bird-half-beast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikidino.com/?page_id=1067 Protoceratops]. Wikidino. Retrieved on 2 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Four]] television program ''Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters'', 8.00–0.00 pm Sat 10 December 2011 and 9.55–10.55 pm Tue 13 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Over repeated retelling and drawing recopying its bony neck frill (which is rather fragile and may have been frequently broken or entirely weathered away) may become large mammal-type external ears, and its beak may be treated as evidence of part-bird nature and lead to bird-type wings being added.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologist Mark Witton has contested this hypothesis, believing that it relies on ignorance of pre-Greek griffin accounts and art, which have occurred considerably before the Central Asian trade scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Witton]], [http://markwitton-com.blogspot.pt/2016/04/why-protoceratops-almost-certainly.html Why Protoceratops Almost Certainly Wasn't The Inspiration For Griffin Legend]&lt;/ref&gt; But no pre-Greek griffin written accounts exist to tell us what was believed about imaginary hybird bird-mammal figures from the pre-classical time period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6855">'''Hohenzollernstraße''' is a two kilometer long street in [[Munich]]'s [[Schwabing]] district.

== Location ==
It starts at [[Leopoldstraße]], then crosses the Kurfürstenplatz and Hohenzollernplatz and changes after the [[Winzererstraße]] in the west to the Schwerere-Reiter-Straße as its extension. Between Kurfürstenplatz and Leopoldstraße are smaller shops. Together with Leopoldstraße the shopping street forms the so-called ''Schwabinger T''.

According to a study by the traffic data and [[Software as a service|SaaS]] provider [[INRIX]] of 2016, Hohenzollernstraße is the most heavily [[Traffic congestion|occupied road]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/wirtschaft/verkehr-studiemuenchen-ist-deutsche-stau-hauptstadt-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-170221-99-371856 | title=Studie: München ist deutsche Stau-Hauptstadt | author= | date=21 February 2017 | website= | publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, [[Georg Kerschensteiner]] founded an experimental school in Hohenzollernstraße 14 which was built in 1905/1906. In 1938, the building was transformed into a hospital, which from 1945 to 1960 served as the "Chirurgisches Krankenhaus München-Nord". In 1961, a high school took its place, where for example, Michael Lerchenberg went to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wochenanzeiger.de/article/64054.html | title=Schwabing · Platz für Unfugspotential | author= | date=21 November 2006 | website= | publisher=Münchner Wochenanzeiger | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1941, between Zentnerstraße and [[Schleißheimer Straße (Munich)|Schleissheimer Straße]], on Hohenzollernstraße is the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] styled Nordbad, which includes a grandstand for 1,400 spectators.

From the Kurfürstenplatz to the west, the [[Trams in Munich|tram lines]] 12 and 27 run over Hohenzollernstraße.

'''Thomasson''' or '''Hyperart Thomasson''' (Japanese: ''Tomason'' トマソン or ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' 超芸術トマソン) is a type of [[conceptual art]] named by the Japanese artist [[Akasegawa Genpei]] in the 1980s. It refers to a useless relic or structure that has been preserved as part of a building or the built environment, which has become a piece of art in itself. These objects, although having the appearance of pieces of conceptual art, were not created to be viewed as such. Akasegawa deemed them even more art-like than art itself, and named them "hyperart." In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Thomasson, especially since the publication of Akasegawa's work on the subject in English in 2010.&lt;ref name=fargo&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [http://kaya.com/books/hyperart-thomasson/ ''Hyperart: Thomasson,''] translated by Matt Fargo, Kaya Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Origin of the term==

The term Thomasson comes from the professional baseball player [[Gary Thomasson]], who was signed by the [[Yomiuri Giants]] for a record-breaking sum of money, and spent his final two seasons with the team (1981–1982) coming close to setting the league strikeout record before being benched.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rDGd7HDMFp4C&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=tomason%20art&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q=tomason%20art&amp;f=false ''The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life''], 2008 p. 397 n25&lt;/ref&gt; Akasegawa viewed Thomasson's useless position on the team as a fitting analogy for "an object, part of a building, that was maintained in good condition, but with no purpose, to the point of becoming a work of art." &lt;ref name="Akasegawa"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480021892/ ''Chōgeijutsu tomason,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese there is no differentiation between singular and plural versions of the noun ''Tomason'', therefore in English too, Thomasson can refer to one or many of these objects. In English, the term is sometimes spelled '''Tomason''', or '''Thomason'''.

==History==

Akasegawa discovered the first Thomasson in 1972, in [[Yotsuya]], [[Tokyo]] when he noticed a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]]. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the curved stone tray of the ticket window, where it had been worn through years of use. Minami Shindō, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in [[Ochanomizu]] that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition.

The artists gave these objects names such as "The pure staircase of Yotsuya," "The useless window of Ekoda" and "The useless gate of Ochanomizu" and referred to them collectively as "hyperart": their similar characteristics being "an object which, just like a piece of art, has no purpose in society, but also, just like a piece of art is preserved with care, to the point where it appears to be on display. However, these objects do not appear to have a creator, making them even more art-like than regular art."&lt;ref name="Akasegawa"/&gt; Hyperart cannot be created by an artist, but only found and recognized as such by an observer.

Those pieces of hyperart that were part of buildings or the built environment were given the name "Thomasson." The name was decided upon during a discussion between Akasegawa and his students during his class on "Modernology" (a concept created by [[Wajiro Kon]]). At that time, Gary Thomasson's strikeout record was at 132.

The concept of Thomasson was introduced to the general public in 1982, via a series of articles in the magazine ''Shashin Jidai'' (Photo Times), published by Byakuya-Shobō. The articles featured findings by Akasegawa's students from his "Modernology" class as well as photographs of those "objects" catalogued by Akasegawa himself, and those sent in by readers. The articles created a "Thomasson Boom" and the concept soon spread. The early Thomasson articles featured in ''Shashin Jidai'' were published by Byakuya-Shobō as a book entitled ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason''.&lt;ref name=byakuya&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, ''Chogeijutsu Tomason,'' Byakuya Shobō, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The complete series of articles was later published as a paperback by [[Chikuma Shobō]] in 1987, using the same title.

==Influence==

The Thomasson boom after the publication of articles in ''Shashin Jidai'' had a big effect on students and young people interested in arts and the avant-garde. The word Thomasson even spread to people who did not understand what it referred to, in a kind of social phenomenon. The cover of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' featured a lost neighborhood of Minato-ku in Tokyo, Tani-cho, which vanished due to land redevelopment. Whilst not directly related to Thomasson, the story of Tani embodied its spirit. Its use on the cover of the book had a large effect on the "Thomasson Boom." This case also showed the effects of the bubble economy on the city landscape.&lt;ref name=tanaka&gt;Jun Tanaka [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555803.2011.599125 "Decaying ‘swamp city’: the death of Shōwa and Tokyo"], Japan Forum, 23:2, 2011, 273-285&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Jordan Sand notes, cataloguing Thomasson was "a way of regaining some sense of the human imprint on the city in an era when that imprint was being rapidly erased."&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;

In 1983 the Thomasson Observation Center held an exhibition entitled "Cityscape in Anguish" at Gallery 612 in [[Shinjuku]], displaying Akasegawa's paintings and photographs of Thomasson by Akasegawa, his students, and those sent in by readers of the magazine.  Various tie-in events such as Thomasson bus tours, lectures by Akasegawa, as well as coverage on the Japanese national broadcaster [[NHK]], and the publication, in 1987 of the complete "Chōgeijutsu Tomason," were the peak of the Thomasson Boom.

Around the same time, other artists and intellectuals were pursuing similar projects. [[Terunobu Fujimori]]'s work on Architecture Detectives, Hayashi Jōji's work cataloguing manhole covers, Minami Shinbo's collections of paper stickers, Ichigi Tsutomu's work on architectural fragments and other such collections, led to Chikuma Shobō publishing a book entitled ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,'' or "Manual on Street Observation" in 1986.&lt;ref name="Street Observation"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, Minami Shinbō, Fujimori Terunobu (Editors) [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480028181/ ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside this, a Street Observation Society event was held to promote their work, along with a press conference.&lt;ref name=Daniell&gt;Daniell, Thomas “Just Looking: The Origins of the Street Observation Society”. [http://aabookshop.net/?wpsc-product=aa-files-64 ''AA Files'', no. 64], Architectural Association School of Architecture, 2012: 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Street Observation did appear to be something of a boom, it was not the same type of movement that had surrounded the activities of Akasegawa, his students, and their magazine articles.  After the arrival of the Street Observation Society, Thomasson disappeared from the public eye for a while, due in part to the fact that the Thomasson Observation Center, run by Akasegawa and his students, overwhelmed by press and public attention, stopped its activities soon after the boom reached its peak.

In the years immediately after the Thomasson boom, the concept was referenced in cinema and literature. In the film [[Patlabor: The Movie]] (1989) a scene featured the "Atom-bomb type" Thomasson. [[William Gibson]]'s 1993 SF novel [[Virtual Light]] also makes multiple references to Thomasson.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;William Gibson, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=HHYUGVbVUZYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=tomason%20%2B%20akasegawa&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Virtual Light,''] Bantam, 1993 pp. 70, 72, 136, 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apache&gt;Takayuki Tatsumi, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=0Dcxkm5u05YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Full%20Metal%20Apache%3A%20Transactions%20Between%20Cyberpunk%20Japan%20and%20Avant-Pop%20America&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=thomasson&amp;f=false ''Full Metal Apache: Transactions Between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America,''] Duke University Press, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==

In 2010 the Chikuma Shobō edition of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' was translated into English by Matt Fargo and published as ''Hyperart:Thomasson.''&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;  In 2012, the Thomasson Observation Center created a Facebook page, and started accepting posts on Thomasson via the internet. The posts were shared widely, and a special form was made available for download to fill out with details of newly discovered Thomasson. A new, internet-era Thomasson movement began. The book and concept have been covered by several English-language media outlets.&lt;ref name=citylab&gt;Citylab [http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/05/useless-and-defunct-city-objects-are-named-thomassons/2075/ Useless and Defunct City Objects Should Be Called... 'Thomassons'], August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=percent&gt;99% Invisible, [http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/thomassons/ Episode 129, ''Thomassons,''] August 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neojaponisme&gt;[http://neojaponisme.com/2008/01/28/roadside-observation/ Darryl Jingwen Wee, "Roadside Observation" ''Neojaponisme'' January 28th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Thomasson Observation Center held a Grand Thomasson Exhibition at a gallery in [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]] to celebrate the 31st anniversary of its founding.&lt;ref name=thomassonten&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/528018727281950/ Grand Thomasson Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of modern Japan Jordan Sand's 2013 work, ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,'' also discusses the Thomasson phenomenon in its third chapter, entitled "Deviant Properties: Street Observation Studies." &lt;ref name=sand&gt;Jordan Sand, [https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Tokyo_Vernacular.html?id=CZqygyfqnpkC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,''] University of California Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand also contributed an essay to the 2010 translation of ''Hyperart: Thomasson''.

In 2013 “La Poussière de soleils,” an exhibition in [[Brooklyn]] gallery Real Fine Arts, featured Thomasson in the form of a photocopy of Akasegawa's photograph of a door handle sticking out of a cement wall.&lt;ref name=artforum&gt;Lauren O'Neill-Butler, [https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201309&amp;id=43560 "La Poussière de soleils,"] Artforum international 52.3, Nov 2013, p.290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Thomasson==
Based on the categories in Chikuma Shobō's "Thomasson Illustrated Encyclopedia" (''Tomason Daizukan'' トマソン大図鑑)&lt;ref name=Daizukan&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032010/ ''Tomason daizukan: mu no maki,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1996; Akasegawa Genpei [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032027/ ''Tomason daizukan: kū no maki,']' Chikuma Shobō, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Useless Staircase===
(Japanese: ''Muyō kaidan'' 無用階段)

Also known as a Pure Staircase. A staircase that only goes up and down. Most used to have a door at the top. Some useless staircases exist that were useless right from completion, due to changes or mix-ups in the design.

===The Useless Doorway===
[[File:非常ドア (8401452825).jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Doorway]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō mon'' 無用門)

Even though it has been blocked up, a Useless Doorway still maintains the majesty of its original purpose. In other cases, a Useless Doorway exists in a place that has no need for it, with no wall or fence around it.

===The Hisashi===
(Japanese: ''Hisashi'' ヒサシ)

Hisashi is the word for "eaves" in Japanese. This refers to useless eaves: ones that no longer have a window or door underneath them to protect from the rain.

===The Useless Window===
(Japanese: ''Muyō mado'', 無用窓)

A blocked up window: one which is still beautiful due to the care taken in blocking it up.

===The Nurikabe===
(Japanese: ''Nurikabe'' ヌリカベ)

Nurikabe is the word for "plaster wall" in Japanese. This overlaps with the Useless Doorway and Useless Window categories. It refers to a door or window that was meant to be completely sealed up with concrete, but a difference can still be seen between it and the surrounding area.

===The A-bomb type===
[[File:Genbaku Type Thomasson in Suruga Word.JPG|thumb|Example of an A-bomb Type Thomasson]]
(Japanese: ''Genbaku taipu'' 原爆タイプ)

A 2-D Thomasson. The outline of a building that remains in silhouette on a wall. This can be seen when a section of a tightly packed row of buildings is torn down. Cases that appear due to water are known as '''Hydrogen bombs''' (''Suibaku'' 水爆). Cases that appear when a hoarding or sign is torn down are known as '''Neutron bombs''' (''Chūseishibakudan'' 中性子爆弾).

===The Elevated type===
(Japanese: ''Kōsho'' 高所)

These objects are normal themselves, but exist in a higher than normal place, therefore seeming strange. For example, a door with a handle on the second floor of a wall. These often appear when staircases are torn down. They can also appear when a winch or crane is kept inside the building, but a standard door is used on the outside.

===The Outie===
(Japanese: ''Debeso'' でべそ)

A protrudence from a sealed up wall, such as a door knob or tap.

===The Uyama===
(Japanese: ''Uyama'' ウヤマ)

A sign or hoarding with letters missing. The first example of this was a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, but the rest of the lettering was missing, hence the name.

===The Castella===
(Japanese: ''Kasutera'' カステラ)

A cuboid protuberance from a wall, named after [[Castella]], a Japanese sponge cake. For example, a blocked up window which sticks out from the wall. The opposite of this, a sunken blocked up section, is known as a '''Reverse Castella'''.

===The Atago===
(Japanese: ''Atago'' アタゴ)

An object sticking out at the side of the road, with no clear purpose, possibly used to stop cars parking. The first example of this was found by Akasegawa whilst walking from [[Shinbashi]] to [[Atago, Minato, Tokyo|Atago]], hence the name.

===The Live Burial===
(Japanese: ''Ikiume'' 生き埋め)

A roadside object which is partly submerged in concrete.

===The Geological layer===
(Japanese: ''Chisō'' 地層)

A patch of ground that is different in height from that around it, usually where multiple construction works have taken place.

===The Boundary===
(Japanese: ''Kyōkai'' 境界)

A guardrail, fence or wall whose purpose is not immediately clear.

===The Twist===
(Japanese: ''Nejire'' ねじれ)

A part of a building which is normally meant to be straight, but is slightly twisted. Often seen when an object that was created to be used straight is used at an angle.

===The Abe Sada===
(Japanese: ''Abe Sada'' 阿部定)

The remains of a telephone pole cut down. The name refers to the [[Abe Sada]] Incident; a famous case from 1930s Japan in which a woman strangled her lover and then severed his genitalia with a kitchen knife.

===The Devouring Tree===
(Japanese: ''Monokūki'' もの喰う木)

A tree which absorbs part of a fence or wire whilst still growing. However, this is not a particularly rare phenomenon, and occurs quite often. If there is no human involvement then it cannot be called a Thomasson, just a natural phenomenon. This is also known as the '''Stubborn Nature Type''' (''shizen kohashi taipu'' 自然強しタイプ).

===The Useless Bridge===
[[File:Nikaryo Futago 06c2902qs.jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Bridge]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō bashi'' 無用橋)

A bridge over a filled-in river, or a bridge that has become useless. In the case of some covered drains, a bridge is still necessary for cars or heavy vehicles to cross. In this case these could not be called Useless Bridges, as they only appear useless.

===The Pure type===
[[File:Tomason tunnel KaifuStation.JPG|thumb|Example of a Pure Tunnel]]
(Japanese: ''Junsui taipu'' 純粋タイプ)

An uncategorizable object whose use it is impossible to fathom. For example, the Pure Shutters, which open to reveal a blank wall, and the Pure Tunnel that exists without a surrounding hill. The Pure Staircase of Yotsuya belongs in this category.

===Evaporation===
(Japanese: ''Jōhatsu'' 蒸発)

The fading of color on a sign, or a monument with parts missing: an object whose meaning has become hard to work out. Cases often appear due to the long-lasting material of the object. This also often occurs when a sign's key phrases, painted in red for emphasis, disappear, leaving the rest of the sign hard to understand.

[[Indian art]] evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically.

== Rasas in the performing arts ==
{{main|Rasa (aesthetics)}}
[[Image:Durga-mudra.png|right|thumb|Raudram rasa of the destructive fury of goddess [[Durga]] in Bharatanatyam]]
The theory of [[rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]s still forms the [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kudiyattam]], [[Kathakali]] and others. Expressing ''Rasa'' in classical Indian dance form is referred to as '''''Rasa-abhinaya'''''. The ''Nātyasāstra'' carefully delineates the ''bhavas'' used to create each ''rasa''.

The expressions used in Kudiyattam or Kathakali are extremely exaggerated theatrical expressions. The opposite of this interpretation is [[Balasaraswathi]]'s school of subtle and understated abhinaya of the devadasis. There were serious public debates when [[Balasaraswathi]] condemned Rukmini Devi's puritanistic interpretations and applications of [[Sringara]] rasa. The abhinaya of the [[Melattur style]] of abhinaya remains extremely rich in variations of the emotions, while the [[Pandanallur style]] expressions are more limited in scope.

==History==
===Natyashastra===
[[Image:Kondadakuli.jpg|thumb|left|"A [[Yakshagana]] artist expressing emotions on stage. Vaachikabhinaya is an important part of Yakshagana"]]
Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the [[Sanskrit]] text [[Nātyashāstra]] (''nātya'' meaning "drama" and ''shāstra'' meaning "science of"), a work attributed to [[Bharata Muni]] where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole.  Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of ingredients.

===Kashmiri aestheticians===
The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician Ãndandavardhana's classic on poetics, the Dhvanyāloka which introduces the ninth rasa, shānta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace (''śānta'') which arises from its bhāva, weariness of the pleasures of the world.  The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept ''dhvani'' or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of ''rasa-dhvani'', primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work "suggests" a real-world emotional state or bhāva, but thanks to [[aesthetic distance]], the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of tragedy, heroism or romance.

The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as "the nondual Shaivism of Kashmir" (or "Kashmir Shaivism") and aesthetician, [[Abhinavagupta]] brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the Dhvanyāloka, the Dhvanyāloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the [[Nātyashāstra]], portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and Patwardhan.  Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] colored by the emotional tone of a drama.

===Inclusion of bhakti===
In the literary compositions, the emotion of Bhakti as a feeling of adoration towards God was long considered only a minor feeling fit only for Stothras, but not capable of being developed into a separate rasa as the sole theme of a whole poem or drama. In the tenth century, it was still struggling, and Aacharya [[Abhinavagupta]] mentions Bhakti in his commentary on the [[Natya Shastra]], as an important accessory sentiment of the Shanta Rasa, which he strove with great effort to establish. However, just as Shantha slowly attained a state of primacy that it was considered the Rasa of Rasas, Bhakti also soon began to loom large and despite the lukewarmness of the great run of Alankarikas, had the service of some distinguished advocates, including [[Tyagaraja]]. It is the [[Bhagavata]] that gave the great impetus to the study of Bhakti from an increasingly aesthetic point of view.

===Attention to rasas===
Poets like [[Kālidāsa]] were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed aesthetic system.  Even in contemporary India the term ''rasa'' denoting "flavor" or "essence" is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Interactive storytelling''' (also known as '''interactive drama''') is a form of digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined. The author creates the setting, characters, and situation which the narrative must address, but the user (also reader or player) experiences a unique story based on their interactions with the story world. The architecture of an interactive storytelling program includes a drama manager, user model, and agent model to control, respectively, aspects of narrative production, player uniqueness, and character knowledge and behavior.{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012|page=28}} Together, these systems generate characters that act "human," alter the world in real-time reactions to the player, and ensure that new narrative events unfold comprehensibly.

The field of study surrounding interactive storytelling encompasses many disparate fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[natural language processing]], [[user interface design]], [[computer science]], and emergent intelligence. They fall under the umbrella term of [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI), at the intersection of hard science and the humanities.{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012|page=21}} The difficulty of producing an effective interactive storytelling system is attributed to the ideological division between professionals in each field: artists have trouble constraining themselves to logical and linear systems and programmers are disinclined to appreciate or incorporate the abstract and unproven concepts of the humanities.{{sfn|Crawford|2012}}

==Definition==
What characteristics distinguish an interactive story from another form of [[interactive media]] is subject to much debate. Interactivity and storytelling are both [[polysemic]] terms, and the phrase "interactive storytelling" does not inherently distinguish it from other kinds of storytelling, many of which are already interactive to some extent. Some of the literature associated with the term "interactive storytelling" is actually about [[transmedia storytelling]], which is not a form of entertainment, but a marketing strategy for building a compelling [[brand]] across digital platforms. Varying levels of interactivity are a function of the "relatedness of transmitted messages with previous exchanges of information where sender and receiver roles become interchangeable." {{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Storytelling, in this case, refers to the process of active creation and authoring rather than the final product and its passive reception. Interactive storytelling by this definition can entail any media that allows the user to generate several unique dramatic narratives. Though its final goal is a fully unauthored AI environment with a comprehensive human-level understanding of narrative construction (i.e., the [[Holodeck]]), projects that use branching stories and variable gates are considered experimental prototypes in the same genre.{{sfn|Szilas|2004}}

Interactive storytelling is defined as distinct from [[interactive fiction]] (or IF), as well as video games with strong narrative focus ([[Mass Effect]], [[BioShock]], etc.), by [[Sense of agency|user agency]] and [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|open-ended narrative]]. [[David Gaider]], an RPG developer at [[BioWare]], stated that "every possible branch needs to be written and fully realized, even if not every player sees it, and thus any game which allows for a lot of player choice becomes a much more expensive proposition for a developer." {{sfn|Chapple|2014}} IF and video games, to balance user choice with authorial effort, must constrain the directions the narrative can take with puzzles, battles, or unchangeable plot points and bottlenecks, all of which detract from a sense of immersion. {{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} Only the most critical of the user's narrative choices are used or remembered in narrative development, according to the need to fulfill specific player goals that define a "gameplay" experience.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=24}} A true IS system would incorporate all of them, as do living human agents, simultaneously and continuously - a task only artificial intelligence can meet. {{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Sandbox games like ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', which do involve extensive AI-based social interaction, do not manage dramatic tension or produce a cohesive narrative .{{sfn|Rauch|2006|p=86}}

To Mateas and Stern, creators of ''[[Façade (interactive story)|Façade]]'' and ''The Party'', interactive storytelling is best understood as interactive theater, in that its goal is dramatic meaning rather than fun.{{sfn|Rauch|2006}} It was [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] who coined the term interactive storytelling in the 90s, arguing that IS is not a video game with a narrative, and that a game and IS cannot be combined successfully.{{sfn|Crawford|2012}} Because of limited technology and the amount of work required, it is still difficult to combine a robust interactive storytelling system and a game engine without detracting from the effectiveness of both.

Emerging voices in the field, however, argue for the possibilities of adding narrative complexity and realistic characters to existing video game genres. Using MADE (Massive Artificial Drama Engine), a team of AI researchers developed a [[Genetic Algorithm]] to guide emergent behavior for secondary non-player characters (NPCs) based on [[literary archetypes]] .{{sfn|García-Ortega|García-Sanchez|Mora|Merelo|2014}} In the open-source AI engine of [[Skyrim|TES: Skyrim]], this was tested to elaborate on the mechanistic behavior of townspeople:
{{Quote|text=...hungry inhabitants could become thieves, guards could pursue the thieves, villagers could fall in love with others, or different war alliances could emerge.|author=García-Ortega et al.|source=''My life as a sim: evolving unique and engaging life stories using virtual worlds'', 2014}}

== History ==
Early attempts to understand interactive storytelling date back to the 1970s with such efforts as [[Roger Schank]]'s research at Northwestern University and the experimental program TaleSpin .{{sfn|Meehan|1977}} In the early 1980s Michael Liebowitz developed "Universe", a conceptual system for a kind of interactive storytelling. In 1986, [[Brenda Laurel]] published her PhD dissertation, "Toward the Design of a Computer-Based Interactive Fantasy System."{{sfn|Lauren|1986}}

During the 1990s, a number of research projects began to appear, such as the Oz Project led by Dr. Joseph Bates and [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the Software Agents group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the Improv Project led by Ken Perlin at [[New York University]], and the Virtual Theater group at Stanford, led by Dr. Barbara Hayes-Roth.

There were also a number of conferences touching upon these subjects, such as the Workshop on Interactive Fiction &amp; Synthetic Realities in 1990; Interactive Story Systems: Plot &amp; Character at Stanford in 1995; the AAAI Workshop on AI and Entertainment, 1996; Lifelike Computer Characters, Snowbird, Utah, October 1996; the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents at Marina del Rey, CA. February 5–8, 1997.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The first conference to directly address the research area was the 1st International Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment, which took place in March 2003 and focused specifically on concepts and first prototypes for automated storytelling and autonomous characters, including modeling of emotions and the user experience.{{sfn|Göbel|2004}} The concepts were developed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], in his 2005 book.{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}

In the 2000s, work on interactive storytelling and related topics expanded, and was presented at events including the alternating bi-yearly conferences, TIDSE (Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment) and ICVS (International Conference on Virtual Storytelling), hosted in Germany and France, respectively. TIDSE and ICVS were superseded by ICIDS (International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling), a yearly event established in 2008.{{sfn|ICIDS}}

The first published interactive storytelling software that was widely recognized as the "real thing" was ''[[Façade (interactive story)|Façade]]'', created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. The system was publicly released in 2006, {{sfn|Mateas|Stern|2003}} and was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance Independent Games Festival]].{{sfn|Christensen|2006}}

== Strategies ==
The architecture of an interactive storytelling system has three component parts: a drama manager, a user model, and an agent model. The drama manager is responsible for guiding the narrative by searching and executing story "beats" in a coherent sequence, refining story events by providing new information and reconciling contradictory plots, and collaborating with the agent model to choose the best narrative actions for the characters .{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} It monitors a number of overview variables in the storyworld to make the best decision for the narrative, defined by the goals of the author: a measure of worldwide conflict would help to increase or decrease dramatic tension, while measures of relationships and likability could guide a story towards a romantic storyline. {{sfn|Crawford|2012|p=210}} The agent model collects information about the story world and characters and generates possible actions in response for each non-player character in the story. Possible actions are drawn from the personality and emotional model of the character, allowing each one to exhibit autonomous behavior with intelligent dramatic goals .{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Finally, the user model keeps track of player choices and inputs, such that the drama manager and agent model can cooperate with the way the user attempts to play rather than challenging or misunderstanding their decisions.

Crawford discusses three potential strategies for developing interactive storytelling systems.  Firstly, environmental approaches are those which take an interactive system, such as a computer game, and encourage the actions of a user in such a way as to form a coherent plot.  With a sufficiently complex system, emergent behavior may form story-like behavior regardless of the user's actions.

Secondly, data-driven strategies have a library of "story components" which are sufficiently general that they can be combined smoothly in response to a user's actions (or lack thereof). This approach has the advantage of being more general that the directed environmental approach, at the cost of a much larger initial investment.

Finally, language-based approaches require that the user and system share some, very limited, domain-specific language so that they can react to each other and the system can 'understand' a greater proportion of the users actions. Crawford suggests approaches that only use, for example, pictorial languages or restricted versions of English.{{sfn|Crawford|2005|loc=Ch.8-10}}

Planning-based systems can be integrated into any of the above approaches to ensure narrative cohesion. The system does this by anticipating potential holes in the plot and repairing them by introducing new information and events. Two such systems include Automated Story Director (ASD), which forms narrative repairs based on plot points predefined by the author, and Player-Specific Automated Storytelling (PAST), which chooses from several possible repairs according to the player's previous behaviors.{{sfn|Ramirez|Bulitko|Spetch|2013}} PAST characterizes a player along five vectors of style based on [[Robin Laws]]' work on player types—fighter, power gamer, storyteller, method actor, and tactician—and may choose to solve a broken plot point for a fighter by adding a battle with a new character, or for a storyteller by adding new background information that justifies the break.

From the background of a multimedia author, media director and designer Eku Wand describes further strategies which are related to structure, space, time and perspective.{{sfn|Wand|2002}}{{sfn|Rieser|Zapp|2002|pp=163–178}} {{elucidate|date=January 2017}}

== Evaluation ==
The success of an interactive storytelling experience depends on a balanced [[dramatic structure]] and user agency. A dramatically interesting narrative experience is one that moderates tension between characters and events over time, such that conflicts arise logically and are not left without resolution. It must also differ noticeably on every "playthrough" as a function of the user's freedom to interact with characters and objects in the virtual world.{{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} This can be achieved to varying degrees of success by branching, emergent, character-driven, and plot-driven systems, but no existing system fully achieves a lifelike experience. AIs do not yet have a human grasp of the rules of drama and narrative, so existing interactive dramas produce a limited number of significantly different story outcomes, relative to the amount of labor required of the author.

There have been several attempts at formalizing an evaluation system for interactive dramas, despite the fact that all existing projects are still in experimental stages. Player agency and fun remain the primary concerns, though fun is often exchanged for more narrative-specific metrics, like "interestingness" and "suspense."{{sfn|Ramirez|Bulitko|Spetch|2013|p=66}} Likert scales filled out by players create a rough quantitative picture of user experience, but leave out much of the subjective interpretation that lies behind complex human interactions.

Mehta et al. focused on conversation-centric systems to develop qualitative metrics for the user's successful engagements, instead of quantitative measures of "inappropriate utterances" (in which the AI misunderstands player input and responds nonsensically) and other technical failures.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=25}} After a "breakdown" in conversation, how effectively the user incorporates it into the overall understanding of the characters and story depends on design features. In their study of Façade, some AI actor breakdowns include shallow semantic understanding, inverted meanings, and the timing of responses. Artificially intelligent agents have trouble translating ambiguous user input into the limited narrative meaning system, as when "sad" or "hurt" is interpreted only as a reference to clinical depression.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=29}} Similarly, negative and positive user sentiments are often confused with one another, especially if a positive statement is preceded by disagreement with a negative one. This is exacerbated if a user cannot send a reply fast enough - their utterance is understood as referring to the most recent speaker, leading to unintended interactions. However, background information is referenced often enough for a player to invent narrative justifications for apparently strange behaviors, which most participants did. {{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=30}}

== Projects ==

=== The Oz Project ===
''The Oz Project'' was an attempt in the early 1990s to use intelligent agent technology to attack the challenges in IS. Its architecture included a simulated physical world, several characters, an interactor, a theory of presentation, and a drama manager. {{sfn|The Oz Project Homepage}} Users communicated with the system using either a text based or graphical interface .{{sfn|Mateas|1997}}{{sfn|Kelso|Weyrauch|Bates|1993}}

=== Façade ===
{{Main article|Façade (interactive story)|l1=Façade}}
''Façade'' is an artificial-intelligence-based approach created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. It was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival and is recognized as the first true interactive storytelling software. It is text based and uses natural language processing and other artificial intelligence routines to direct the action .{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}{{sfn|Mateas|Stern|2003}}

=== HEFTI ===
The ''Hybrid Evolutionary-Fuzzy Time-based Interactive'' (HEFTI) storytelling system was produced at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and uses genetic algorithms to recombine and evaluate story components generated from a set of story templates.&lt;ref&gt;A genetic algorithm approach to interactive narrative generation, JJ Leggett and T. J. Ong - Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM conference, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crawford described it as the "wrong approach to development systems [...] incomprehensible to the kind of creative talent needed for storytelling," {{sfn|Crawford|2005}} it continues to be discussed as a research and approach and genetic algorithm continue to be considered a potential tool for use in the area.

=== Library of story traces ===
Figa and Tarau have used [[WordNet]] to build technologies useful to interactive storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;WordNet, wordnet.princeton.edu/, retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This approach defines 'story traces' as an abstract reduction (or skeleton) of a story, and 'story projection' as a fragment of a story that can be treated as a single dramatic building block. This work seeks to build up large repositories of narrative forms in such a way that these forms can later be combined .{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}

=== Interactive narrative design ===
As defined by [[Stephen Dinehart]], Interactive narrative design combines [[ludology]], [[narratology]] and [[game design]] to form interactive entertainment development methodologies. Interactive entertainment experiences allow the player to witness data as navigable, participatory, and dramatic in real-time:{{sfn|Dinehart|2009c}} “a narratological craft which focuses on the [[structuralism|structuralist]], or [[literary]] [[semiotic]] creation of stories." Interactive Narrative design seeks to accomplish this via viewer/user/player (VUP) navigated dataspaces {{sfn|Dinehart|2009a}}

Interactive narrative design focuses on creating meaningful participatory story experiences with interactive systems. The aim is to transport the player through play into the videogame (dataspace) using their visual and auditory senses.{{sfn|Dinehart|2009b}} When interactive narrative design is successful, the VUP (viewer/user/player) believes that they are experiencing a story.{{sfn|Dinehart|2009c}}

=== Summary table {{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} ===
Story possibilities are not precisely calculable, and are represented as orders, such that O(10) would be in the order of tens of stories, and O(1) would be fewer than 10 unique story possibilities.

'''Irrealism''' is a philosophical position first advanced by [[Nelson Goodman]] in "Ways of Worldmaking",&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[aesthetics]].

==Nelson Goodman's irrealism==
Irrealism was initially motivated by the debate between [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]] in [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than viewing either as prior to the other, Goodman described them both as alternative "world-versions", both useful in some circumstances, but neither capable of capturing the other in an entirely satisfactory way, a point he emphasizes with examples from psychology.&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 : Ch. V)&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to extend this [[epistemology|epistemic]] pluralism to all areas of knowledge, from equivalent [[formal system]]s in [[mathematics]] (sometimes it is useful to think of points as primitives, sometimes it is more useful to consider lines the primitive) to alternative schools of [[art]] (for some paintings thinking in terms of representational accuracy is the most useful way of considering them, for others it is not). However, in line with his consideration of [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]], Goodman goes beyond saying merely that these are "world-versions" of ''the'' world, instead he describes worlds as "made by making such versions".&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.94)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysically, Goodman's irrealism is distinct from [[anti-realism]] though the two concepts are frequently confused. "We are not speaking in terms of multiple possible alternatives to a single actual world but of multiple actual worlds."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; He makes no assertions regarding "the way the world is" and that there is no primary world version i.e. "no true version compatible with all true versions." As Goodman says, "Not only motion, ... but even reality is relative."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.20)&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that Goodman accepts many forms of realism and anti-realism without being troubled by the resulting contradictions.

==Other Irrealists==

The artist [[Tristan Tondino]] has had several exhibitions entitled "Irreality" which crossover into other fields and include philosophy, mathematics, [[ophthalmology]], science and politics. He writes, "Realism is an Irrealism. Reality is plurality - we partially create it, we must open our universes and our perceptions to all new versions that may promote the concept of human rights and expand its possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Émile Brisson, Plurielle Ouverture, AGIR, Amnestie Internationale, vol 25, #3, septembre 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a painting depicting a chair and entitled "The Hegemony of the Real", Tondino has written "That the Real must be regarded as a fiction does not detract from its hegemony".

The [[sociologist]] [[Nikolas Rose]] subscribes to irrealism in his ''Powers of Freedom'', though his irrealism differs from Nelson's in being 'technical, not psychologistic, furthering Nelson's assertions of the human mind are only capable of a limited understanding and that it is a construct built upon itself."

==Other Forms of Irrealism==

The philosophical term may be used in more specific or arguably narrower senses, such as "colour irrealism".&lt;ref&gt;https://frodo.ucsc.edu/~jellis/Papers/Color.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning''' in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] is a [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts|visual]] [[arts center]] that was founded in 1972 in an effort to revitalize the surrounding business district. As of 2012, it serves more than 28,000 people annually via a 1,650 [[square foot]] [[art gallery|gallery]], a 99-seat [[proscenium]] theater, and art &amp; music studios.  The building that houses the center is the former Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] that is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=jchist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcal.org/about/history.html|work=History|title=History|publisher=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the building is one of only two remaining [[Sidewalk clock on Jamaica Avenue|cast-iron sidewalk clocks]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/sights/gallery/jamaica-center-for#ixzz24z7X3knH|work=New York City Sights|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a late-Victorian era headquarters of the [[Jamaica Savings Bank]] next door.

==Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building==
'''Office of the Register''', also known as Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, is a historic government building located in the [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] section of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]].  It was built between 1895 and 1913 and is an imposing, three story building with a [[limestone]] facade in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Italian Renaissance]] style. A rear five story addition was built in 1938.  The facade features deep rustication on the first floor and a smooth [[ashlar]] surface above.  The building housed the Office of the Register until 1974, after which it became the Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning (JCAL).&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7361|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Office of the Register|date=October 1989|accessdate=2011-01-16 |author1=David J.

'''License-free software''' is [[computer software]] that is not explicitly in the [[public domain]], but the software owner has not made explicit the terms of the [[software license|license]] which makes the software fully [[copyright]] protected according to the [[Berne convention]].

== Examples ==

Examples of license-free software formerly included programs written by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], such as [[qmail]], [[djbdns]], [[daemontools]], and [[ucspi-tcp]]. Bernstein held the copyright and distributed these works without license until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622043020/http://qmail.org/not-open-source.html "qmail is not open source"] - an article published by Russell Nelson, OSI board member in 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From December 28, 2007 onwards, he started placing his software in the [[public domain]] with an explicit [[waiver]] statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html
 |title=Frequently asked questions from distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/qmail/dist.html
 |title=Information for distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, small [[Scripting language|script]]s are frequently released without specifying a license.  For example, the website Userscripts.org hosts more than 52,000 [[Greasemonkey]] user scripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |title=Scripts &amp;mdash; Userscripts.org 
 |accessdate=2010-06-29 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506055146/http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |archivedate=May 6, 2014 
}} &lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which have no specified license.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Similarly, github reported in 2015 that 85% of the projects it hosts are unlicensed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source/ the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source] on techrepublic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights for users ==

On his [http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html Software users' rights] web page, Bernstein explains his belief that under the terms of copyright law itself software users are always allowed to modify software for their own personal use, regardless of [[Software license agreement|license agreements]].  He says '"If you think you need a license from the copyright holder, you've been bamboozled by Microsoft. As long as you're not distributing the software, you have nothing to worry about."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html|title=Software user's rights |work=yp.to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also says that software users are allowed to back up, to compile, and to run the software that they possess.

He further says that ''"since it's not [[copyright infringement]] for you to apply a [[patch (computing)|patch]], it's also not copyright infringement for someone to give you a patch,"'' noting the case of ''[[Galoob v. Nintendo]]'' as precedent.  Thus modified versions of license-free software can legally be distributed in [[source code]] form in whatever way that the original can, by distributing a [[patch (computing)|patch]] alongside it.

== Reception and discussion ==

Advocates of license-free software, such as Bernstein, argue that [[software license]]s are harmful because they restrict the freedom to use software, and copyright law provides enough freedom without the need for licenses. Though having some restrictions, these licenses allow certain actions that are disallowed by copyright laws in some jurisdictions. If a license tries to restrict an action allowed by a copyright system, by Bernstein's argument those restrictions can be ignored. In fact, Bernstein's "non-license" of verbatim retransmission of source code is very similar in nature.

Similar positions on licenses are voiced by [[Free culture movement|Free culture]] activist [[Nina Paley]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ninapaley.com/2010/11/06/driving-without-a-license/ Driving Without a License?] on ninapaley.com ''"I can’t work up enthusiasm for any license today."'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Luis Villa]] argued similarly negative about the license usage of "open source", when the small number projects licensed on [[GitHub]] were noticed, identifying a "[[Post Open Source]] movement against the (license) [[permission culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lu.is/blog/2013/01/27/taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/ taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/] on lu.is (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macramé''' is a form of [[textile]] produced using [[knot]]ting (rather than [[weaving]] or [[knitting]]) techniques.

The primary knots of macramé are the square or [[reef knot]]) and forms of "hitching": various combinations of [[half hitch]]es. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to cover anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.

Cavandoli macramé is one variety that is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse half hitches are sometimes used to maintain balance when working left and right halves of a balanced piece.

Leather or fabric belts are another accessory often created via macramé techniques.  Most [[friendship bracelet]]s exchanged among schoolchildren and teens are created using this method. Vendors at theme parks, malls, seasonal fairs and other public places may sell macramé jewellery or decoration as well.

== History ==
[[File:Macrame clove hitch left-2.jpg|thumb]]
Macramé comes from a 13th-century Arabic weavers' word ''migramah'' meaning "fringe".  This refers to the decorative fringes on camels and horses  which help, amongst other things, to keep the flies off the animal in the hot desert regions of northern Africa.

Another school of thought indicates that it comes from Turkish ''makrama'', "napkin" or "towel", and was a way to secure the ends of pieces of weaving by  using the excess thread and yarn along the top and bottom edges of loomed fabrics.

One of the earliest recorded uses of macramé-style knots as decoration appeared in the carvings of the [[Babylon]]ians and [[Assyria]]ns. Fringe-like plaiting and braiding adorned the costumes of the time and were captured in their stone statuary.
Macramé traveled from north Africa to Spain with the [[Moorish conquest|Moors]], and as a result of this conquest it spread, firstly to France, and then  throughout Europe.

In the Western Hemisphere, macramé is believed to have originated with 13th-century [[Arab]] weavers. These artisans knotted the excess thread and yarn along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The Spanish word ''macramé'' is derived from the Arabic ''miqramah'' ({{lang|ar|مقرمة}}), believed to mean "striped towel", "ornamental fringe" or "embroidered veil". After the Moorish conquest, the art was taken to [[Spain]], then to [[Italy]], especially in the region of [[Liguria]], and then spread through Europe. It was introduced into [[England]] at the court of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught the art of macramé to her ladies-in-waiting.[[File:Decorative macramé ship.jpg|thumb]]

Macramé was most popular in the [[Victorian era]]. ''Sylvia's Book of Macramé Lace'' (1882), a favorite, showed readers how "to work rich trimmings for black and coloured costumes, both for home wear, garden parties, seaside ramblings, and balls&amp;mdash;fairylike adornments for household and underlinens ...". Most Victorian homes were adorned by this craft. Macramé was used to make household items such as tablecloths, bedspreads and curtains.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Sailors made macramé objects in off hours while at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to places like [[China]] and the [[New World]]. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made [[hammock]]s, [[bell fringe]]s, and [[Belt (clothing)|belts]] from macramé. They called the process "square knotting" after the knot they used most frequently. Sailors also called macramé "McNamara's lace".&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Though the craze for macramé faded, it regained popularity during the 1970s as a means to make wall hangings, articles of clothing, bedspreads, small jean shorts, [[tablecloth]]s, [[draperies]], plant hangers and other furnishings. By the early 1980s macramé had again begun to fall out of fashion as a decoration trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chace | first = Susan | last2 = Pennant | first2 = Lilla | last3 = Warde  |first3 = John Maury | last4 = Wright | first4 = David | year = 1981 | title = Crafts &amp; Hobbies | publisher = [[Reader's Digest]] | page = 28 | isbn = 0-89577-063-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WnL6RWTLOcQC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macramé jewelry has become popular among the American young and old crowd, starting in the early 1970s. Using mainly square knots and [[granny knot]]s, this jewelry often features handmade glass beads and natural elements such as bone and shell. Necklaces, anklets and bracelets have become popular forms of macramé jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/photos/114987252639255164965/album/5961184404667827329/6182213837107670098|title=Album - Google+ |website=plus.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[File:Macrame Owls.jpg|thumb]]Materials used in macramé include cords made of [[cotton]] twine, [[linen]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[leather]] or [[yarn]].  Cords are identified by construction, such as a 3-ply cord, made of three lengths of fibre twisted together.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Complete Guide to Needlework|year=1979|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association Canada|location=Montreal|isbn=0888500858|pages=445|editor=Virginia Colton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewelry is often made in combination of both the knots and various [[beads]] (glass, wooden, and so on), pendants or shells. Sometimes 'found' focal points are used for necklaces, such as rings or [[gemstones]], either wire-wrapped to allow for securing or captured in a net-like array of intertwining [[overhand knot]]s. A knotting board is often used to mount the cords for macramé work. Cords may be held in place using a [[C-clamp]], straight pins, T-pins, U-pins, or upholstery pins.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

For larger decorative pieces, such as wall hangings or [[window covering]]s, a work of macramé might be started out on a wooden or metal dowel, allowing for a spread of dozens of cords that are easy to manipulate. For smaller projects, push-pin boards are available specifically for macramé, although a simple corkboard works adequately. Many craft stores offer beginners' kits, work boards, beads and materials ranging in price for the casual hobbyist or ambitious craftsperson.

'''''Marley &amp; Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog''''' is a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestselling autobiographical book by journalist [[John Grogan (journalist)|John Grogan]], published in 2005, about the thirteen years he and his family spent with their yellow [[Labrador Retriever]], Marley. The dog is poorly behaved and destructive, and the book covers the issues this causes in the family as they learn to accept him in addition to their grief following Marley's death. It has subsequently been adapted by the author in three separate books, as well as separately into a [[Marley &amp; Me (film)|comedy-drama film]] released in 2008.

==Story==
Told in [[first-person narrative]], the book portrays Grogan and his family's life during the thirteen years that they lived with their dog Marley, and the relationships and lessons from this period. Marley, a yellow [[Labrador Retriever]], is described as a high-strung, boisterous,  and somewhat uncontrolled dog. He is strong, powerful, endlessly hungry, eager to be active, and often destructive of their property (but completely without malice). Marley routinely fails to "get the idea" of what humans expect of him; at one point, mental illness is suggested as a plausible explanation for his behavior. His acts and behaviors are forgiven, however, since it is clear that he has a heart of gold and is merely living within his nature.

Marley was filmed for a two-minute credited appearance in the 1996 movie ''[[The Last Home Run]]''.

The strong contrast between the problems and tensions caused by his neuroses and behavior, and the undying devotion, love and trust shown towards the human family as they themselves have children and grow up to accept him for what he is, and their grief when he finally dies from [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (a stomach torsion condition) in old age, form the backdrop for the biographical material of the story.

In the autobiography, the author states that the eulogy he wrote in his [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|newspaper]] following the death of his dog received more responses than any other column he had written in his professional life up until that point.&lt;ref&gt;"Marley &amp; Me" ch. 29 p. 281-282: ''A recorded warning I had never heard before. "Your mailbox is full" [...]. I logged onto my computer and opened my e-mail. Same story. [...] This morning there were hundreds, far more than anything I had received before.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
''Marley &amp; Me'' has been rewritten into three different books:
* ''Marley: A Dog Like No Other'', for younger readers who would enjoy reading about Marley's story, without the sexual content in the original
* ''Bad Dog, Marley!'', a picture book for readers learning to read in lower grade levels
* ''A Very Marley Christmas''

In 2008, the novel was adapted into a family comedy-drama motion picture, also titled ''[[Marley &amp; Me (film)|Marley &amp; Me]]''. Released on December 25, 2008, the film stars [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] and is directed by [[David Frankel]]. A prequel followed in 2011, ''[[Marley &amp; Me: The Puppy Years]]''.

==Author's comments==
In a discussion on his website devoted to the book, Grogan looks back on his family's time with Marley, and the lessons learned, and concludes that: "[C]ommitment matters. That 'in good times and bad, in sickness and in health' really means something. We didn't give up on Marley when it would have been easy to, and in the end he came through and proved himself a great and memorable pet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johngroganbooks.com/marley/qanda.html|title=Marley &amp; Me Q&amp;A|last=Grogan|first=John|publisher=John Grogan's "Marley &amp; Me" website|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of Sarah Elizabeth (née Woodbury) and Henry Lewis Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Roth, Christina J. Moose, Rowena Wildin (eds.), ''World Philosophers and Their Works: Freud, Sigmund – Oakeshott, Michael'', Salem Press, 2000, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[Jewish]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cohnitz &amp; Marcus Rossberg, ''Nelson Goodman'', Routledge (2014), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Harvard University]], [[A.B.]], [[magna cum laude]] (1928). During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, while studying for a Harvard Ph.D. in [[philosophy]], which he completed in 1941.&lt;ref name="Harvard Obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | title=Goodman Dies | work=Harvard University Gazette | accessdate=18 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614040257/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | archivedate=14 June 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards [[aesthetics]], where he became better known than in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. During [[World War II]], he served as a psychologist in the [[United States Army|US Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard. 2000. ''Project Zero: Nelson Goodman's Legacy in Arts Education''. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (58)3, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1946–1964, where his students included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Sydney Morgenbesser]], [[Stephen Stich]], and [[Hilary Putnam]]. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at several universities from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.

In 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H., and Perkins, D. "The Mark of Zero: Project Zero’s Identity Revealed." ''HGSE Alumni Bulletin'', December 1994, '''39'''(1), 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman died in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], Massachusetts.

==Philosophical work==
===Induction and "grue"===
In his book ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'', Goodman introduced the "[[new riddle of induction]]", so-called by analogy with [[David Hume|Hume]]'s classical [[problem of induction]]. He accepted Hume's observation that [[inductive reasoning]] (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons). How then can we differentiate between regularities or [[hypotheses]] that construe law-like statements from those that are [[contingent]] or based upon accidental generality?

[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[confirmation theory]] argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and [[evidence]] statements, which apply to only one thing.  Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate [[Grue and bleen|grue]], which applies to all things examined before a certain time ''t'' just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time ''t''. If we examine emeralds before time ''t'' and find that emerald ''a'' is green, emerald ''b'' is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds ''a, b, c,''..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are [[Grue and bleen|grue]].  Thus, before time ''t'', the apparently law-like statements "All emeralds are green" and "All emeralds are grue" are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously "All emeralds are grue" is not a law-like statement.

Goodman's example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial [[dilemma]] that "anything can confirm anything".

===Nominalism and mereology===
Goodman, along with [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]], is the founder of the contemporary variant of [[nominalism]], which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with [[set theory]]. Goodman's nominalism was driven purely by [[ontology|ontological]] considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with  [[W. V. O. Quine]], Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with [[set theory]] – discredited as sole [[foundations of mathematics]] as of 1913 ([[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'').

The program of [[David Hilbert]] to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1936 by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]].  Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, 
Quine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman's Penn colleague [[Richard Milton Martin]] argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward.

According to [[Thomas Tymoczko]]'s ''afterword'' in ''New directions in the philosophy of mathematics'', Quine had "urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation", putting the "key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context."  In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]] were merged into [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empiricism]]:  the emphasis of [[mathematical practice]] as effectively part of the [[scientific method]], an emphasis on method over result.

The Goodman–Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of [[mereology]]. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman's 1951 ''The Structure of Appearance'', a revision and extension of his Ph.D. thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his Ph.D. thesis still did).&lt;ref&gt;Cohnitz and Rossberg (2003), ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed.  Mereology is accordingly "ontologically neutral" and retains some of Quine's pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as [[American Pragmatism]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">The '''Nuremberg Mahzor''' is a 14th-century manuscript of the [[siddur]] according to the 'Eastern' [[Ashkenazi]] rite.  Written in 1331, the ornamental manuscript includes the [[Jewish services]] for all occasions throughout the year, together with commentaries (in the margins) which have never been published.

The manuscript was written on parchment and, at 20&amp;nbsp;inches high by 14&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and weighing more than 57 pounds (26 kilograms), is one of the largest and heaviest [[codex|codices]] to have survived anywhere.  It contains 521 [[Wiktionary:folio|folio]]s. 

The illuminated Nuremberg Mahzor contains prayers and [[piyyut]]im
for the whole year according to the Eastern Ashkenazi
(Austrian) rite, the five Megillot and the Haftarot.  

The Nuremberg Mahzor got its name from its home for more than 300 years – the Nuremberg municipal library in Germany. 

The manuscript was originally commissioned for private study and synagogue use by a Jewish patron and was most likely used by the Nuremberg community after 1499. From the 16th century until 1951 the manuscript was in the possession of the [[Nuremberg]] Municipal Library. 

In 1951, Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and book collector, purchased the Nuremberg Mahzor as post-World War II restitution for property confiscated by the Nazis. Since then it was stored for 50 years in the Schocken Institute for Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. During that time it went only once on public display. In 2005 the manuscript was purchased by the private collector Dr. David Jeselsohn, Zurich. 

In the 19th century, 11 leaves were removed from the prayer book by Napoleon’s army, museum officials believe. Schocken acquired four of the missing leaves in the 1930s after he fled Nazi Germany. One leaf, who was in a private collection, has been purchased by Jeselsohn in 2010. Six leaves are still missing.

Immediately after the purchase of the Nuremberg Mahzor by Dr. Jeselsohn, the whole book has been scanned by the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss-pr/mahzor-nuremberg/ mahzor-nuremberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and after a six-months restoration at the Israel Museum laboratories it went on display at the Israel Museum's Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem from September 2009 through February 2010. Today, the Nuremberg Mahzor is part of the permanent exhibits of the renewed Israel Museum.

The Nuremberg Mahzor is described as a "unique cultural object from the Middle Ages". It was written in calligraphic script by a scribe who is assumed to be a professional artist. The style of illumination is that of the [[Upper Rhine valley]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}
== What ''type'' of thing is sculpture? ==
Sculpture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "sculpture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, sculpture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Sculpture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.

A '''Phlyax play''' ({{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:φλύαξ|φλύαξ]]}}, also phlyakes), also known as a '''hilarotragedy''', was a [[burlesque]] dramatic form that developed in the [[Greek colony|Greek colonies]] of [[Magna Graecia]] in the 4th century BCE. Its name derives from the Phlyakes or “Gossip Players” in [[Doric Greek]]. From the surviving titles of the plays they appear to have been a form of [[Greek mythology|mythological]] burlesque, which mixed [[List of Greek mythological figures|figures from the Greek pantheon]] with the stock characters and situations of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Attic New Comedy]].

Only five authors of the genre are known by name: [[Rhinthon]] and Sciras of Taranto, Blaesus of Capri, Sopater of Paphos and Heraklides. The plays themselves survive only as titles and a few fragments.&lt;ref&gt;See Rudolf Kassel, Colin Austin Poetae Comici Graeci, vol. I, pp. 257–88. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial body of [[South Italian ancient Greek pottery|South Italian vases]] are thought to represent scenes of the phlyakes, giving rise to much speculation on Greek stagecraft and dramatic form.

==Characteristics of the genre==
[[Image:Theatre slave Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Phlyax actor as a slave from a Sicilian chalice-[[krater]] by a painter of the [[Lentini]]-[[Manfria]] [[Lentini-Manfria Group|Group]], c. 350–40 BCE ([[Louvre]])]]
[[Nossis]] of Locri provides the closest contemporary explanation of the genre in her [[epitaph]] for Rhinthon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pass by with a loud laugh and a kindly word&lt;br&gt;For me: Rhinthon of Syracuse am I,&lt;br&gt;The Muses’ little nightingale; and yet&lt;br&gt;For tragic farce I plucked an ivy wreath.&lt;ref&gt;Anthologia Palatina 7.414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Textual and archaeological evidence give a partial picture of these burlesques of mythology and daily life. The absence of any surviving script has led to conjecture that they were largely [[improvisation|improvised]]. The vase paintings indicate that they were performed on a raised wooden stage with an upper gallery, and that the actors wore grotesque costumes and [[theatre mask|masks]] similar to those of Attic Old Comedy. Acrobatics and farcical scenes were major features of the phlyax.

The phlyakes seems to die out by the late 3rd century, but the [[Oscan]] inhabitants of [[Campania]] subsequently developed a tradition of farces, parodies, and satires influenced by late Greek models, which became popular in Rome during the 3rd century BC. This genre was known as [[Atellan farce]], [[Atella]] being the name of a Campanian town. Atellan farce introduced a set of [[stock character]]s such as Maccus and Bucco to Latin comedy; even in antiquity, these were thought to be the ancestors of the characters found in [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Horace]], Epistles II, 1, 170 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps distantly of those of [[commedia dell'arte]]. Although an older view held that Attic comedy was the only source of [[Roman comedy]], it has been argued that Rhinthon in particular influenced Plautus’s ''[[Amphitruo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Z Stewart , The ‘Amphitrue’ of Plautus and Euripides ‘Bacchae’ TAPhA 89, 1958, 348–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vase paintings==
The so-called Phlyax vases are a principal source of information on the genre. By 1967, 185 of these vases had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Trendall, Phlyax Vases, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Since depictions of theatre and especially comedy are rare in fabrics other than the South Italian, these have been thought to portray the distinctly local theatre tradition.&lt;ref&gt;This argument was first made by H Heydemann in ''Die Phlyakendarstellungen der bemalten Vasen'' of 1886. Scholarship of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, in particular the work of [[Oliver Taplin]], has cast doubt on this ascription of the vases to the phlyakes seeing them instead as depictions of Attic Old Comedy.&lt;/ref&gt; The vases first appeared at the end of the 5th century BCE, but most are 4th century. They represent grotesque characters, the masks of comedy, and the props of comic performance such as ladders, baskets, and open windows. About a quarter of them depict a low wooden temporary stage, but whether this was used in reality is a point of contention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margarete Bieber]], ''The History of Greek and Roman Theater'', 1961, takes a rather literal reading of this whereas W. Beare, ''The Roman Stage'', 1964, insists this is a matter of the painter’s interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars view the vases as depicting Attic Old Comedy rather than Phlyakes.&lt;ref&gt;Trendall and Webster, ''Illustrations of Greek Drama'', 1971, correlated Greek and Roman painted linen comic masks with their representation on the vases.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wurzburg Telephus Travestitus vase ([[Krater#Bell krater|bell krater]], H5697) was identified in 1980 as a phlyax vase,&lt;ref&gt;Kossatz-Deissmann, in Tainia: Festschrift für [[Roland Hampe]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; but Csapo&lt;ref&gt;E. Csapo, A Note on the Wurzburg Bell-Krater H5697, Phoenix 40, 1986, 379–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and Taplin&lt;ref&gt;O. Taplin, Classical Philology, Icongraphic Parody and Potted Aristophanes, Dioniso 57, 1987, 95–109, taking the vase as evidence that Attic Old Comedy was performed outside Athens after death of Aristophanes.&lt;/ref&gt; independently have argued that it  actually represents the ''[[Thesmophoriazousai]]'' of [[Aristophanes]].

Papal '''regesta''' are the copies, generally entered in special registry volumes, of the [[papal]] letters and official documents that are kept in the papal archives. The name is also used to indicate subsequent publications containing such documents, in chronological order, with summaries of their essential contents, for which English diplomatics use usually the term [[Calendar (archives)|"calendar"]].

==Early history==

The growth of the correspondence of the [[Holy See]] is evident even by the end of the 2nd century. Probably from a very early date a copy was made of papal documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the Roman Church. At that time high officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called ''commentarii regesta'', the latter word from ''regerere'', to inscribe.

The existence of such papal regesta can be proved for the 4th century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] ("Apolog. adv. Rufinum", III, xx), [[St. Jerome]] refers to the archives (''chartarium'') of the Roman Church, where the letter of [[Pope Anastasius I|Pope Anastasius]] (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of Origen was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of papal letters in the documents of several popes of the 5th century. Thus Pope Zosimus in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the bishops of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at Rome (Coustant, "Epist. Rom. Pontif.", 955). Consequently, copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the papal chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers.

==Surviving regesta==

From the centuries previous to the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1199–1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the papal chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the papal regesta up to the end of the 12th century have disappeared.

The most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590-604). An investigation proved that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to [[indictions]]; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. This indicates the plan of the earliest volumes of the papal Regesta. A manuscript of the Vatican archives contains letters of [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] (872-882) from September 876 to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but an 11th-century copy. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this pope, are in a manuscript of the 12th century in the British Museum (Ms. Add. 8874). The manuscript contains letters of [[Gelasius I]] (492-96), [[Pelagius I]] (556-561), [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847-55), John VIII (872-82), [[Pope Stephen V|Stephen V]] (885-91), Alexander II (1061–73), and [[Urban II]] (1088–99). The study of the manuscript by Ewald ["Neues Archiv", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another manuscript at Cambridge contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of Adrian IV (1154–59), Alexander III (1159–81), and Lucius III (1181–85) [see Löwenfeld in "Neues Archiv", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of Gregory VII (1073–85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a manuscript in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the antipope Anacletus II (1130–38) containing thirty-eight letters has been preserved in a manuscript of Monte Cassino (Ewald in "Neues Archiv", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest papal Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the Middle Ages. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the papal archives, from which the authors of these collections, as Anselm of Lucca, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material.

==From the 13th century==

From [[Pope Innocent III]] onward the manuscript volumes of the papal Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives.

The Regesta of the 13th century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the 14th century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the popes returned from Avignon to Rome, these paper Regesta were left at Avignon, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to Rome. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the Avignon epoch of the 14th century. From the 14th century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the 13th century the letters were divided into "Litteræ communes" and "Litteræ de curia" or "Curiales", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (litteræ secretæ, litteræ de beneficiis) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the papal letters made in the papal chancery, there were similar Regesta of the papal letters executed since the 14th century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the 14th century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the papal documents, but the memorials to the pope, in reply to which the papal documents were issued.

==As historical sources==

As collections of the official documents of the papal chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority.{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known papal documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are:

*[[Philipp Jaffé]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum p. Chr. n. 1198"; 2nd ed. by S. Löwenfeld, F. Kaltenbrunner, P. Ewald (2 vols., Leipzig, 1888); 3rd ed. by Klaus Herbers, Waldemar Könighaus, Cornelia Scherer, Thorsten Schlauwitz, Marucs Schütz, Viktoria Trenkle, Judith Werner (vol. 1 (39?-604), Göttingen 2016).
*[[Paul Fridolin Kehr]] has undertaken a new edition of the Regesta for this period in topographical and at the same time chronological order: "Regesta Pontif. Roman.: Italia Pontifica" (Berlin, 1906–); "Germania Pontificia" (Berlin, 1910-); Gallia Pontificia; Iberia Pontificia; Polonia Pontificia; with the cooperation of other scholars.
*Jaffé's work was supplemented by [[August Potthast]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum inde ab an p. Chr. n. 1198 ad an. 1304 (2 vols., Berlin, 1874-75).

The database [http://www.papsturkunden.de "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum online"] from the "Göttinger Papsturkundenwerk" will combine the several Regesta projects up to the year 1198.

Letters of several popes taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: Löwenfeld: "Epistolæ Pontificum Romanorum ineditæ" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the manuscript at Cambridge; Rodenberg, "Epistolæ sæc. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. selectæ" (Berlin, 1883 —), in "Mon. Germ. Hist." The Regesta of the letters of Gregory I were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, "Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum" in "Mon. Germ. Hist." (Berlin, 1891 —).

The letters of Gregory VII were edited by Jaffé, "Monumenta Gregoriana" in "Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of John VIII were published from the manuscript in the Vatican. Of the popes of the 13th century, Pressuti edited (Rome, 1888–96) the Regesta on Honorarius III (1216–27) from the volumes of the Regesta in the Vatican Archives; the Regesta of the succeeding popes to Boniface VII (d. 1303) were edited by the members of the Ecole Françoisaise of Rome, the publication of the Regesta of all the popes being yet incomplete; after a group of Benedictines had issued the Regesta of Clement V (1305–14), the members of the Ecole Françoisaise began again with John XXII (1316–34), with the intention of publishing the Regesta of the Avignon popes to Gregory XI (1370–78). In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of France. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of Leo X (1513–21), edited by [[Cardinal Hergenröther]] (see under the different popes).

In addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the 14th century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and dioceses, e.g., Werunsky, "Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, "Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern" (Munich, 1890).

'''''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto''''' is a 2008 [[open-source film|open-source]] documentary film about "the changing concept of [[copyright]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner, Scott. [http://cinematech.blogspot.com/2007/10/cinematech-filmmaker-q-brett-gaylor-of.html "CinemaTech Filmmaker Q&amp;A: Brett Gaylor of Open Source Cinema".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott, Shane. "[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html The Load-Down] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630225243/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html |date=30 June 2007 }}", ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', 2007-03-29. Accessed 2008-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Brett Gaylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto/ brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto] on [[wired.com]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Created over a period of six years, the documentary film features the collaborative remix work of hundreds of people who have contributed to the [[Open Source Cinema]] website, helping to create the "world's first [[open source]] documentary" as Gaylor put it. The project's [[working title]] was ''Basement Tapes'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 CinemaTech interview with Brett Gaylor about Open Source Cinema project] at [[Google Videos]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205075005/https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 |date=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to [[The Basement Tapes|the album of the same name]]) but it was renamed ''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto'' prior to theatrical release. Gaylor encourages more people to create their own remixes from this movie,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160826014720/http://www.documentary.org/content/copyright-or-copywrong-rip-challenges-intellectual-property-rights Copyright or Copywrong?: 'RiP' Challenges Intellectual Property Rights] By Marc Glassman on documentary.org (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; using media available from the Open Source Cinema website, or other websites like [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]], [[Hulu]], or [[MySpace]].

==Background==
Gaylor traveled the world to find like-minded people who would help him draft the "Remixer's Manifesto" that makes up the structure of his open source documentary. The manifesto reads as follows:
{{quote|
#Culture always builds on the past.
#The past always tries to control the future.
#Our future is becoming less free.
#To build free societies you must limit the control of the past|Brett Gaylor in Rip! A Remix Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy |first=Steve |url=http://creativegeneralist.com/2009/03/rip-a-remix-manifesto/ |title=Rip! A Remix Manifesto |website=Creative Generalist |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To further his point, Gaylor separates the corporations from the [[public domain]], defining the former using so-called "[[Copy right|CopyRIGHT]]," and the latter, which represents the free exchange of ideas, as "[[Copyleft|CopyLEFT]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelevan |first=Douglas |url=http://dgelevan.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/getting-ripped-brett-gaylors-rip-a-remix-manifesto-a-case-study/ |title=Getting 'RiP'ped – Brett Gaylor's RiP: A Remix Manifesto |website=Douglas Gelevan Reports |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaylor and Gillis are clearly on the side of the Copyleft, promoting the free flow and growth of creativity and ideas. To enable a free [[Remix culture|remixing culture]] also with his film, he released RiP! under the [[CC BY-NC-SA]] 3.0&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Studies/RIP:_A_Remix_Manifesto IP:_A_Remix_Manifesto] on creativecommons.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons license]].

==Participants==
The documentary is particularly interested in the [[non liquet|legal]] [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] of remixing existing works. The film features appearances by:

* Gregg Gillis (better known as [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]) an American musician specializing in [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]-style remixes, which often use a dozen or more unauthorized samples from different songs to create an entirely new track. Gillis' 2006 album Night Ripper had potentially 300 copyright infringements and carried a maximum financial liability penalty of around $45 million. To some he is considered a creative rebel of a mash-up artist, while others deem his work pure copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |title=RiP: A Remix Manifesto: review |website=Canada.com |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926143114/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lawrence Lessig]], an American [[Academia|academic]] and political activist, and a professor of law at [[Harvard Law School]] and founder of the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]]. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], trademark, and [[radio frequency|radio frequency spectrum]], particularly in technology applications. He was previously a professor of law at Stanford Law School. Gaylor discusses the legal protection of fair use with Lessig to determine the ability to produce the film.
* [[Cory Doctorow]], a Canadian blogger, journalist and science fiction author. Doctorow is co-editor of the blog [[Boing Boing]] and is an activist in favor of reforming [[copyright]] laws. He is a proponent of the [[Creative Commons]] organization, using some of their licenses for his books. Common themes in his work include [[digital rights management]] and [[file sharing]]. In the film, Doctorow states, "Technology giveth, technology taketh away.”
* [[Gilberto Gil]], the Brazilian musician and former Minister of Cultural Affairs who initiated pioneering programs in [[Brazil]] through a partnership with [[Creative Commons]]. As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives [[Grant (money)|grants]] to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |authorlink=Larry Rohter |title=Gilberto Gil and the politics of music |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/12/news/gil.php |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=[[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brazil]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dan O'Neill]], an underground cartoonist and founder of the [[Air Pirates]], a group which was famously sued by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for copyright infringement.
* [[Jammie Thomas]], the single mom successfully sued by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) at the [[Capitol v. Thomas]] case for Thomas' illegal downloading. The single mother, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,220 in damages for making 24 songs available for download on the [[Kazaa]] [[file sharing network]].

==Other topics==
The 1710 [[Statute of Anne]] gave authors the exclusive rights to their works. The documentary was able to be made and distributed due to the part of [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright law]] deemed [[fair use]], the ability to use copyrighted works to prove a point. Fair use allows for [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. Due to the fact that Gaylor tries to prove a point about copyright law and the rights of artists in his film, he is legally allowed to use examples to get his point across. He uses remixed music in the film to give examples of what would be considered illegal. The film also discusses the consequences of illegal downloading and [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset]]t case was the first file-sharing copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States to be brought in front of a jury by [[major record labels]].

==Festivals and awards==
''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto'' made its international debut at the IDFA ([[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]]) in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081207072305/http://www.idfa.nl/en/news/latestnews/winners-idfa-2008-announced.aspx "winners at the IDFA festival 2008"].

The '''Rival Poet''' is one of several characters, either fictional or real persons, featured in [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]]. The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the [[Shakespeare's sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] group in [[Sonnet 78|sonnets 78]]–[[Sonnet 86|86]]. Several theories about these characters, the Rival Poet included, have been expounded, and scholarly debate continues to put forward both conflicting and compelling arguments. In the context of these theories, the speaker of the poem sees the Rival Poet as a competitor for fame, wealth and patronage.

==Possible candidates==
Among others, [[George Chapman]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Barnabe Barnes]], [[Gervase Markham]],&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 52, 127, 141-2, 303, 463.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Barnfield]]&lt;ref&gt;Leo Daugherty, ''William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the Sixth Earl of Derby'', Cambria Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  have been proposed as identities for the Rival Poet.

=== George Chapman ===

[[George Chapman|Chapman]] was a prominent poet and translator of [[Homer]]. Scholars speculate that Shakespeare was familiar with his work, having read part of his translation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' for his own ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'',{{sfn|Bevington|1998|p=21}} a dramatic reworking of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] epic poem. Chapman wrote ''Ovid's Banquet Of Sense'', a metaphysical poem seen as a response to the erotic ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]],'' which incidentally features Shakespeare's most quoted poet, [[Ovid]]. In ''Shakespeare and the Rival Poet'', Acheson conjectures that Chapman's erotic poems were written with a view to gaining Southampton's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Acheson|1903|pp=14–15, 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral tone of ''Ovid's Banquet of Sense'' eschews the amatory tone of Shakespeare's, and seeks to instill spiritual seriousness in a work that takes the five senses as its [[Conceit]]s. Chapman's patrons also moved in the same circles as Shakespeare's; thus Shakespeare may have felt insecure about the stability of his own income versus a talented rival. Chapman was both then and now regarded as being particularly erudite, whereas, as [[Ben Jonson]] writes, Shakespeare had "small Latine and lesse Greeke".&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, W. T.  [http://franklin.press.illinois.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'']. 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christopher Marlowe ===

[[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] was more highly regarded as a dramatist than a poet, his chief poetical work, ''[[Hero and Leander]],'' remaining incomplete at the time of his death (it was subsequently completed by Chapman). Due to Marlowe's relatively small dramatic output as compared with Shakespeare, it's unlikely that he would have been the subject of Shakespeare's sonnets, i.e. considered a serious rival. By the time Shakespeare began his works Marlowe was a well-established playwright but the two had a very important artistic relationship. In his book ''The Genius of Shakespeare'', Jonathan Bate notes "the two-way traffic between Marlowe and Shakespeare until the latter’s death".&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Jonathan. ''The Genius of Shakespeare.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare strove to outdo Marlowe and through their artistic competition they would push one another to higher achievements in dramatic literature.  This competition could have also motivated the Rival Poet sonnets.&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Jonathan. ''The Genius of Shakespeare.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple poets ===

It has also been suggested that the Rival Poet is an amalgam of several of Shakespeare’s contemporaries instead of a single person. This is indicated by the fluctuation between singular and plural addresses of the rival(s) in the sonnet sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, MacD. P.  [http://res.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/224/224 "Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare’s Rival Poet Sonnets".] ''Review of English Studies.'' 56.224 (2005): 224–246. 16 Nov 2007: 225&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Sonnet 78]] the Speaker refers to other poets who have gained inspiration from the Fair Youth but in [[Sonnet 79|79]] the Speaker is only concerned with one "he", a potentially "worthier pen". Sonnet 80 continues the singular reference but by 82 the Speaker reverts to the plural "writers".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 225&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sonnet 83|83]] he refers to "both your poets" indicating that the Speaker is one poet and the Rival is the other. According to MacD. P. Jackson, [[Sonnet 86]] is "the most powerful of the group [and] the most detailed in its characterization of one specific Rival Poet".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 226&lt;/ref&gt; While arguably the most powerful of this sonnet grouping, one cannot neglect the oscillation between singular and plural seen throughout the group as a whole. This discrepancy makes it difficult to isolate one specific poet to claim the title of Rival.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p=244}}

The Speaker's attitude towards the Rival is also difficult to pinpoint. Some critics, such as R. Gittings, believe that much of the Poet’s comments on his rival should be read as ironic or satiric.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 180&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson maintains that the Poet's feelings toward the Rival shift between varying degrees of admiration and criticism. This also indicates a multitude of rivals.  As the Poet's confidence ebbs and flows along with his impression of his rival(s), the identity of the rival(s) also fluctuates.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p=226}}

A final defense for the Multiple Rivals Theory relies on a dating of the Rival Poet sonnets between 1598–1600.  While this frame of reference has support, so do other possible dates and there will always be controversy regarding dating of individual sonnets.  However, if it is assumed that this grouping was published between 1598 and 1600, a publication by [[Francis Meres]] comes into play.  In 1598, Meres published ''[[Palladis Tamia|Palladis Tamia; Wits Treasury]]'' with a chapter titled "A Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets" in which he documents the critical esteem of the poets of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare received high praise for his dramatic work but Marlowe and Chapman were deemed England's "two excellent poets".&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Jackson 234&lt;/ref&gt;  This, according to Jackson, "must surely have helped provoke the Rival Poet series".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 234&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is an overview of '''[[Samuel Johnson]]'s literary criticism'''.

==Poetry==
Johnson's literature, especially his ''Lives of the Poets'' series, is marked by various opinions on what would make a poetic work excellent. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. In particular, he was suspicious of [[John Milton]]'s language, whose blank verse would mislead later poets, and could not stand the poetic language of [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Gray, Johnson wrote, "Gray thought his language more poetical as it was more remote from common use".&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Gray''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson would sometimes write parodies of poetry that he felt was poorly done; one such example is his translation of [[Euripides]]'s play, ''Medea'' in a parody of one poet's style alongside of his version of how the play should be translated. His greatest complaint was the overuse of obscure allusion found in works like Milton's ''Lycidas'', and he preferred poetry that could be easily read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem would incorporate new and unique imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his shorter works, Johnson preferred shorter lines and to fill his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced [[Alfred Edward Housman]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=31, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''London'', his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the form to express his political opinion. It is a poem of his youth and deals with the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. As [[Donald Greene]] claims, "its charm comes from youthful exuberance and violence with which the witty invective comes tumbling out" in lines like:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Here malice, rapine, accident conspire,
And now a rabble rages, now a fire;
Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,
And here the fell attorney prowls for prey;
Here falling houses thunder on your head,
And here a female atheist talks you dead.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, his second imitation, ''The Vanity of Human Wishes'', is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but are part of Johnson's works as a whole. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In terms of biography, Johnson did not agree with [[Plutarch]]'s model of using biographies to teach morals and compliment the subjects. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the subjects accurately, including any negative aspects of an individual's life. Although revolutionary and more accurate as a biographer, Johnson had to struggle with his beliefs against a society that was unwilling to hear of details that may be viewed as tarnishing a reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rambler'' 60, Johnson put forth why he thought society could not be comfortable with hearing the negative truth of individuals that they admire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;blockquote&gt;All joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities of others is produced by an act of imagination that realizes the event, however fictitious, or approximates it, however remote, by placing us, for a time, in the condition of him whose fortune we contemplate, so that we feel, while the deception lasts, whatever motions would be excited by the same good or evil happening to ourselves... Our passions are therefore more strongly moved, in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or pleasure proposed to our minds, by recognizing them as once our own.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Also, Johnson did not feel that biography should be limited to the most important people, but felt that the lives of lesser individuals could be deemed the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Lives of the Poets'', he chose great and lesser poets, and throughout all of his biographies, he always insisted on including what others may consider as trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to autobiography, and diaries including his own, Johnson considered that genre of work as one having the most significance; he explains this in ''Idler'' 84, when he described how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort their own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicography==
Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry found their union in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism, including his ''Dictionary'' to which he wrote: "I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, ''for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the smaller dictionary was written for the masses and become the common household dictionary, Johnson's original dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially those uses that were found in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from the literary fields that Johnson thought were most important: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotes and usages were all compared and carefully studied, so that others could understand what words meant in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Plays of Shakespeare title page.jpg|thumb|left|''Plays of William Shakespeare'' (1773 expanded edition) title page]]

Johnson felt that words, in and of themselves, were meaningless, but that meaning comes from context. The only way to understand the word is to examine its usage, and a critic must understand lexicography before they can understand what people are saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics would attempt to create theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature, but Johnson was not a theorist and he used his ideas only for the practical purpose to better read the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of a reader in understanding language when he wrote, "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them".&lt;ref name="Green p. 141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare==
His works on Shakespeare were not devoted just to Shakespeare, but to critical theory as a whole, and, in his ''Preface'' to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous belief of the [[classical unities]] and establishes a more natural theory on what makes drama work: drama should be faithful to life. In particular, Johnson claimed that "Among [Shakespeare's] other excellences it ought to be remarked, because it has hitherto been unnoticed, that his ''heroes are men'', that the love and hatred, the hopes and fears, of his chief personages are such as common to other human beings... Shakespeare's excellence is not the fiction of a tale, but the representation of life: and his reputation is therefore safe, till human nature shall be changed."&lt;ref name="Green p. 141"/&gt; Besides defending Shakespeare, Johnson was willing to discuss Shakespeare's faults, especially his lacking of morality, his vulgarity, and carelessness in crafting plots.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 142"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Besides direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. In his ''Preface'', Johnson analysed the various versions of Shakespeare's plays and argued how an editor should work on them. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions that each contained errors from the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors deeming difficult words as incorrect and changing them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way, and, when creating his own edition of Shakespeare's plays, he relied on the thousands of quotations and notes that he used in crafting his ''Dictionary'' to restore, to the best of his knowledge, the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ペアグラス (32809810466).jpg|thumb]]
{{Nihongo|'''Satsuma kiriko'''|薩摩切子}} is a type of cut [[glass]] from Japan. It was manufactured by the [[Satsuma clan]] from the final years of the [[Edo period]] to the beginning of the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912). Today, faithful reproductions are produced.

==History==
[[Shimazu Narioki]] (1791–1859), a feudal lord of the Edo period, invited glass craftsmen from Edo (now Tokyo) to produce Satsuma kiriko. The manufacturing methods were based on foreign books from Nagasaki. Narioki’s son [[Shimazu Nariakira]] introduced it into his Shuseikan Enterprise, the first western-style industrial enterprise in Japan, with factories that produced steel, textiles, and other products. The cut glass was very advanced craftwork. Nariakira was extremely fond of it, and sent it to other feudal lords as presents. After his death, the manufacture of Satsuma kiriko was discontinued in the early Meiji period because of financial difficulties, damage to the factory in the [[bombardment of Kagoshima]], and disturbances during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. The craftsmen and skills dispersed to Tokyo and [[Osaka]]. Only a few pieces of Satsuma kiriko were produced in those days, so they fetch high prices as antiques.

== Manufacture of Satsuma Kiriko ==
The ''Hari Seiko Zensho'' (Handbook of Glass Technology), written in 1830 by Kazuyoshi Hanai detailed the manufacture of Satsuma kiriko.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''Hari Seiko Zensho'' presented a glassmaking technique influenced heavily by China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Satsuma kiriko was made by melting lead and mixing it with powdered white stone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the stone and lead was reheated, zinc was sometimes combined with the mix in order to "eliminate impurities".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, as the mixture cooled niter was added to it and after melting the compound was shapen into Satsuma kiriko.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The difference between Edo Kiriko and Satsuma Kiriko==
Edo kiriko ([[:ja:江戸切子]]) features transparent and colorless glass, while Satsuma kiriko is more delicate and features overlaid colored glass. According to a recent study, the new one is produced since the section of the colorless Satsuma kiriko is tidied up.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} The main feature is the deep color of the overlaid colored glass. Also, cutting the glass boldly gives beautiful gradations of color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsuchiya|first=Yoshio|date=1984-01-01|title=SATSUMA KIRIKO JAPAN'S FIRST ARTISTIC CUT GLASS|jstor=24188802|journal=Journal of Glass Studies|volume=26|pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western influence in Meiji Japan ==
To properly understand Satsuma Kiriko, it can be helpful to understand the Japanese historical context it was developed in. During the Meiji period, Japan began to market goods to the Western market, which saw the manufacture of textiles specifically for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Meiji Kyoto Textile Art and Takashimaya|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|volume=65|issue= 1 |date=Spring 2010| pages =  37–88|doi=10.1353/mni.0.0106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satsuma Kiriko was heavily influenced by Dutch and English glassmaking techniques.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influences in Glassmaking in the 18th and 19th Centuries|journal=Journal of Glass Studies|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western hunger for Japanese art showed itself in the form of "japonisme", where artists used Japanese motifs and techniques in their art. Vincent Van Gogh was famously influenced by Japanese art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Reproduction and present==
From 1985 a glass factory, an artisan, and a researcher together succeeded in reproducing Satsuma kiriko. In 1989 Satsuma glass industrial art, under the supervision and direct management of [[Shimadzu Limited]], was certified{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} as a traditional artifact of [[Kagoshima]]. At present, they produce both reproductions of the old-style Satsuma kiriko and new designs and colors based on that style.

==Area of production==
Satsuma kiriko is made in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. The overlaying colored glass and the reproductions are produced in the workshops of Satsuma Glass Studio and Satsuma Vidro Craft. Making kiriko needs sophisticated skills because the overlaying colored glass makes it difficult to manipulate the grinder. Some Satsuma kiriko production is outsourced to Edo kiriko craftsmen.

'''''Seinfeld''''' is&lt;!-- Do not change to "was" as fiction is written in present tense and remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention. See: [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --&gt; an American television [[sitcom]] that ran for nine seasons on [[NBC]], from 1989 to 1998. It was created by [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]], with the latter starring as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictionalized version of himself]]. Set predominantly in an apartment building in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, including best friend [[George Costanza]] ([[Jason Alexander]]), friend and former girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), and neighbor across the hall [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]). It is often described as being "a show about nothing", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; 

''Seinfeld'' was produced by West-Shapiro Productions and [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] in association with [[Columbia Pictures Television]]. In syndication, the series has been distributed by [[Sony Pictures Television]] since 2002. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included [[Larry Charles]], [[Peter Mehlman]], [[Gregg Kavet]], [[Carol Leifer]], [[David Mandel]], [[Jeff Schaffer]], [[Steve Koren]], [[Jennifer Crittenden]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Tom Gammill]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Max Pross]], [[Dan O'Keefe (writer)|Dan O'Keefe]], [[Charlie Rubin]], [[Marjorie Gross]], [[Alec Berg]], [[Elaine Pope]], and [[Spike Feresten]]. A favorite among critics, the series led the [[Nielsen ratings]] in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'') every year from 1994 to 1998.

''Seinfeld'' is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms ever made. It has been ranked among the best television shows of all time in publications such as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20712079_20711820,00.html#21351455|title=TV: 10 All-Time Greatest|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/09/28/rolling-stone-has-come-up-with-the-100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-my-list-was-a-little-different/|title=Rolling Stone has come up with the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

==Premise==

===Characters===
;Main
[[File:Seinfeld actors montage.jpg|thumb|Jerry Seinfeld (upper left); Jason Alexander (upper right); Michael Richards (lower right); Julia Louis-Dreyfus (lower left)]]
* [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] ([[Jerry Seinfeld]]) – Jerry is a "minor [[Celebrity|celeb]]" [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] who is often depicted as "[[Everyman|the voice of reason]]" amidst the general insanity generated by the people in his world. The in-show character is a mild [[Mysophobia|germaphobe]] and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|neat freak]], as well as an avid [[Superman]], [[New York Mets]] and [[breakfast cereal]] fan. Jerry's apartment is the center of a world visited by his eccentric friends and a focus of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=jerry&amp;type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Jerry |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212015442/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elaine Benes]]  ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) – Elaine is Jerry's ex-girlfriend and later friend. She is attractive and genial, while also being humorous, arrogant and occasionally impulsive. She sometimes has a tendency to be too honest with people (usually by losing her temper), which often gets her into trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=elaine&amp;type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Elaine |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217220207/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=elaine&amp;type=char |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She usually gets caught up in her boyfriends' quirks, eccentric employers' unusual behaviors and idiosyncrasies, and the maladjustment of total strangers. She tends to make poor choices in men she chooses to date and is often overly reactive. First she works at Pendant Publishing with Mr. Lippman, is later hired as a personal assistant for Mr. Pitt, and later works for the J. Peterman catalogue as a glorified assistant. Elaine is popularly described as an amalgamation of David's and Seinfeld's girlfriends during their early days in New York as struggling comedians.
* [[Cosmo Kramer]]  ([[Michael Richards]]) – Kramer is Jerry's "wacky neighbor". His trademarks include his humorous upright [[pompadour hairstyle]], vintage clothes, and energetic sliding bursts through Jerry's apartment door. Kramer was heavily based on a neighbor of David's during his amateur comedic years in Manhattan. At times, he appears [[Naivety|naïve]], gullible, and ignorant, and at other times, intelligent, understanding, and well-read; similarly, he is exaggeratedly successful, socially, with his charisma and laid-back personality. This is seen in his success with women and employers. He has been described as a "hipster doofus". Although he never holds a steady job, he is rarely short of money and often invents wacky schemes that often work at first then eventually fail. Kramer is longtime friends with [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], and they work well together despite their differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=kramer&amp;type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Kramer |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217215856/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=kramer&amp;type=char |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Costanza]]  ([[Jason Alexander]]) – George is Jerry's best friend, and has been since high school.

He complains and lies easily about his profession, relationships and almost everything else, which usually creates trouble for him later. He often uses the alias Art Vandelay when lying or concocting a cover story. Despite these shortcomings, George has a sense of loyalty to his friends and success in dating women and eventually secures a successful career as Assistant to the Traveling Secretary for the [[New York Yankees]].

;Recurring
{{Main|List of Seinfeld minor characters}}
Many characters have made multiple appearances, like Jerry's nemesis [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]] and his [[Uncle Leo]]. In addition to recurring characters, ''Seinfeld'' features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses and other acquaintances. Many actors who made guest appearances became household names later in their careers, or were already well known.

===Plotlines===
Many ''Seinfeld'' episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines. For example, George's storyline, "[[The Revenge (Seinfeld)|The Revenge]]", is based on Larry David's experience at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=212 |title=Seinfacts: The Revenge |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150813/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=212 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Contest]]" is also based on David's experiences. "[[The Smelly Car]]" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. "[[The Strike (Seinfeld)|The Strike]]" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday—[[Festivus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=910 |title=The Strike |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150844/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=910 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories take on a variety of turns. "[[The Chinese Restaurant]]" consists of George, Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=206 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Chinese Restaurant |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111123925/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=206 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Boyfriend (Seinfeld)|The Boyfriend]]", revolving around [[Keith Hernandez]], extends through 2 episodes. "[[The Betrayal (Seinfeld)|The Betrayal]]" is famous for using [[reverse chronology]], and was inspired by a similar plot device in a [[Harold Pinter]] play, [[Betrayal (play)|''Betrayal'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=908 |title=The Betrayal |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150839/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=908 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features "Notes About Nothing", "Inside Look", and "Audio Commentary". In "[[The Maestro (Seinfeld)|The Maestro]]", Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|McDonald's coffee case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=703 |title=The Maestro |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150829/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=703 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=416 |title=The Outing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150823/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=416 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
The series was often described as "a show about nothing".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |title=Seinfeld |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427105254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |archivedate=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/276165|title=Seinfeld: Overview|author=Erickson, Hal|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seinfeld|first1=Jerry|title=Jerry Seinfeld here.

''Seinfeld'' broke several conventions of [[mainstream]] television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-03/features/1998123008_1_seinfeld-elaine-benes-julia-louis-dreyfus|title=The world according to 'Seinfeld' No hugging, no learning. No aging, commitment or obligation. We've laughed at such postmodern sentiments for nine years. Is there anything wrong with that?|last=Zurawik|first=David|date=May 3, 1998|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the "no hugging, no learning" rule.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"/&gt; Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of [[pathos]]; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even [[The Invitations|Susan's death]] elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292901,00.html|title=Killing Time|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Nisid|last=Hajari|date=June 7, 1996|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters are "thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postmodernism: A New Model of Reality|url=http://www.mckenziestudycenter.org/philosophy/articles/postmod.html|first=R. Wesley|last=Hurd|date=June 1998|publisher=McKenzie Study Center|accessdate=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usual conventions, like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters' world from that of the actors and audience, were broken. One such example is the [[story arc]] where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named ''Jerry''. The [[show within a show]], ''Jerry'', was much like ''Seinfeld'' in that it was "about nothing" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional ''Jerry'' was launched in the season four finale, but unlike ''Seinfeld'', it wasn't picked up as a series. ''Jerry'' is one of many examples of [[metafiction]] in the show. There are no fewer than twenty-two fictional movies featured, like ''Rochelle, Rochelle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/all-the-fictional-movies-on-seinfeld-ranked/|title=All The Fictional Movies On 'Seinfeld,' Ranked|work=UPROXX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these several elements, ''Seinfeld'' became the first TV series since ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' to be widely described as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]].&lt;ref name="grenz"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Primer on Postmodernism|isbn=0-8028-0864-6|last=Grenz|first=Stanley J.|authorlink=Stanley Grenz|publisher=[[Wm.

Jerry Seinfeld is an avid Abbott and Costello fan, and has cited the [[Abbott and Costello Show]] as an influence on ''Seinfeld.'' "Everybody on the show knows I'm a fan. We're always joking about how we do stuff from their show. George and I will often get into a riff that has the rhythm from the old Abbott and Costello shows. And sometimes I'll hit George in the chest the way Abbott would hit Costello." The  series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza's middle name is "Louis," after Costello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/arts/seinfeld-as-opening-act-for-abbott-and-costello.html|title=Seinfeld as Opening Act For Abbott and Costello|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=21 November 1994|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]" episode features a cantankerous character named "Sid Fields" as a tribute to the landlord on the team's TV show. Kramer's friend is named Mickey Abbott. A copywriter for the J. Peterman catalog is named Eddie Sherman, after the team's longtime agent. In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, "His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder."

===Catchphrases===
Many terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Caryn James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/seinfeld/sein5-11parting.html|title=Goodbye!

* "[[The Yada Yada|Yada, yada, yada]]"
* "[[The Soup Nazi|No soup for you!]]"
* "[[The Alternate Side|These pretzels are making me thirsty]]"
* "[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|Not that there's anything wrong with that!]]"
* [[Festivus]]
* [[The Sponge|spongeworthy]]
* "[[The Contest|Are you master of your domain?]]"
* [[Chips and dip#Double-dipping|double-dipping]]
* [[Regift|re-gifter]]
* [[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|close-talker]]
* [[The Puffy Shirt|low-talker]]
* [[The Bizarro Jerry|man-hands]]
* [[The Serenity Now|Serenity Now!]]
*[[The Hamptons (Seinfeld)|shrinkage]]

The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as [[Seinlanguage]], the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.&lt;ref name="grenz"/&gt;

===Music===
A signature of ''Seinfeld'' is its theme music. Composed by [[Jonathan Wolff (musician)|Jonathan Wolff]], it consists of distinct solo [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bass [[synthesizer]] riffs (played on a [[Korg M1]] synthesizer)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neal|first1=Meg|title=A Beginner's Guide To The Synth|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/12/a-beginners-guide-to-the-synth/|accessdate=November 30, 2016|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by [[beatboxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaQ7y5OeHWI|title=Entertainment Tonight – Jonathan Wolff Seinfeld music|date=|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bass synthesizer music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot episode]]. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.

In "[[The Note (Seinfeld)|The Note]]", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a [[Scat singing|scatting]] female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like "easy to beat". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.&lt;ref&gt;Season 3 DVD: Inside Look of 'The Note'&lt;/ref&gt; In the commentary of "The Note", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Season 3 DVD: 'The Note' commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in "The Betrayal", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a [[sitar]].

''Seinfeld'' stood out from family and group [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] of its time. The principal characters are not related by family or work connections but remain distinctively close friends throughout the series.

Many characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances. Two prominent recurring characters were based on well-known people: [[Jacopo Peterman]] of the [[The J.

''Seinfeld'' follows its own structure: story thread is presented at the beginning of every episode, which involves the characters starting in their own situations. Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' "consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy" among the small cast of characters.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Katherine. ''"Not That There's Anything Wrong with That": Reading the Queer in Seinfeld''. In Calvin Thomas (Ed.). ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. Champaign. Illinois: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show maintains a strong sense of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]—characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being [[Seinfeld (season 4)|season four]], which revolved around the [[television pilot|pilot]] pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in "[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in "[[The Stock Tip]]". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the "Peterman catalog". [[Larry David]], the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''—David's later comedy series—expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.

A major difference between ''Seinfeld'' and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A [[mantra]] of the show's producers was: "No hugging, no learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Seinfeld|url=http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|publisher=[[TV1 (Australia)|TV1]]|accessdate=2008-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831074136/http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|archivedate=2007-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s TV critic [[Ken Tucker]] has described them as "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken.

===Seasons 1–3===
[[Image:757 New Hampshire Ave 2.jpg|thumb|The Los Angeles building used to depict the exterior of Jerry's apartment building at 129 West 81st Street, Manhattan]]
The show premiered as ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]'' on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which declined to pick it up. [[Rick Ludwin]], head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a [[Bob Hope#Broadcasting|Bob Hope television special]], and the next 4 episodes were filmed.&lt;ref name="Season 1 &amp; 2 DVD review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreaux |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |title=Seinfeld: Season 1 &amp; 2 DVD Review |publisher=tvdvdreviews.com |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418075527/http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |archivedate=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|littlefield20120529}} These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of ''[[Cheers]]'' on Thursdays at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called ''FM''. The series was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'' after the failure of short-lived 1990 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''The Marshall Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI_qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21|title=Seinfeld FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Show About Nothing|first=Nicholas|last=Nigro|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2015-06-01|accessdate=2015-12-29|isbn=9781495035357}}&lt;/ref&gt; After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes.

TV critics championed ''Seinfeld'' in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry's stand-up comedy act would bookend an episode, even functioning as [[cut scene]]s during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. "[[The Deal (Seinfeld episode)|The Deal]]" establishes Jerry and Elaine's relationship by setting rules about sleeping together and remaining friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=213 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Deal |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date=1991-05-02 |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172948/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=213 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Parking Garage (Seinfeld episode)|The Parking Garage]]" was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after "[[The Chinese Restaurant (Seinfeld episode)|The Chinese Restaurant]]", with not showing Jerry's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=306 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Parking Garage |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116052213/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=306 |archivedate=November 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[The Keys (Seinfeld episode)|The Keys]]" contains a crossover to [[CBS]] show ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', marking the first such cooperation between rival networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=321 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Keys |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172940/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=321 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Busboy (Seinfeld)|The Busboy]]" introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time. Although Castle Rock Entertainment's Glenn Padnick thought Jerry Seinfeld was too generous, showcasing his co-stars' comedic talent became a trademark throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=203 |title=Seinfeld -– Now Playing  |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114031559/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=203 |archivedate=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Charles wrote an episode for season two, "The Bet", in which Elaine buys a gun from Kramer's friend. This episode wasn't filmed because the content was deemed unacceptable, and was replaced by the episode "[[The Phone Message]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=207 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The phone message |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2008-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150808/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=207 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Stranded]]", aired in season three, was intended for season two. In the beginning of this episode, Jerry clears up the continuity error over George's real estate job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=209 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219225606/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=209 |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 4–5===
Season four marked the sitcom's entry into the [[Nielsen ratings]] Top 30, coinciding with several popular episodes, such as "[[The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld episode)|The Bubble Boy]]" in which George and the bubble boy argue over ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=407 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118152059/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=407 |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Junior Mint (Seinfeld episode)|The Junior Mint]]" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=421 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925045350/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=421 |archivedate=September 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, ''Jerry''. Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of ''Seinfeld'' episodes was cut.

Much publicity followed the controversial episode, "[[The Contest (Seinfeld)|The Contest]]", an [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word "[[masturbation]]" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=411 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173057/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=411 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through that season, ''Seinfeld'' was moved from its original 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, following ''[[Cheers]]'' again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' on ABC had aired at the same time and ''Improvement'' kept beating ''Seinfeld'' in the ratings. [[NBC]] moved the series after [[Ted Danson]] announced the end of ''Cheers'' and ''Seinfeld'' quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ''Cheers'' reruns that spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60203201.html?dids=60203201:60203201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+4%2C+1993&amp;author=DANIEL+CERONE&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=%60Seinfeld%27+Is+Suddenly+Something+Sitcom+That%27s+%60About+Nothing%27+Finding+More+Fans+in+New+Time+Slot |author=Cerone, Daniel|title=Seinfeld Is Suddenly Something|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show won an Emmy Award for ''Outstanding Comedy Series'' in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', which was only in its second season on rival network ABC.

Season five was an even bigger ratings-hit, consisting of popular episodes, such as "[[The Puffy Shirt]]" in which Jerry feels embarrassed wearing a "pirate" shirt on ''[[The Today Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=503 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117030920/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=503 |archivedate=November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Non-Fat Yogurt]]" featuring [[Rudy Giuliani]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] then-mayor-elect of New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=508 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118040205/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=508 |archivedate=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Opposite]]" in which George, doing the opposite of what his instincts tell him he should do, lands a job with the [[New York Yankees]] and Elaine leaves "Pendant Publishing" because of a comedy of errors that lead to its demise. Another story arc has George returning to live with his parents. In the midst of the story arc, Kramer creates and promotes his [[coffee table book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=521 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Opposite |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173017/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=521 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to the ''Cheers'' spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', then in its first season. ''Seinfeld'' was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but always lost to ''Frasier'', which went on to win a record thirty-nine Emmy Awards in its eleven-season run.

===Seasons 6–7===
In season six, [[Andy Ackerman]] replaced [[Tom Cherones]] as director of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as "[[The Beard]]" in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched ''[[Melrose Place]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=615 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175528/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=615 |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]" in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=610 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Switch |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031736/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=610 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Understudy (Seinfeld)|The Understudy]]" in which Elaine meets J.

This was the first season in which ''Seinfeld'' reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.

In season seven, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot ''Jerry'' proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were "[[The Cadillac (Seinfeld)|The Cadillac]]" in which George plans to date award-winning actor [[Marisa Tomei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=714 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516034018/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=714 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Bottle Deposit]]" with Elaine and Sue Ellen participating in a bidding war to buy JFK's golf clubs in an auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=721 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]]|accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031807/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=721 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 8–9===
The show's ratings were still going strong in its final two seasons. Larry David left at the end of season seven, although he continued to voice Steinbrenner, so Seinfeld assumed David's duties as [[showrunner]], and, under the direction of a new writing staff, ''Seinfeld'' became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famed "man hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=803 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Bizarro Jerry |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117185550/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=803 |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable episodes from season eight include "[[The Little Kicks]]" showing Elaine's horrible dancing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=804 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Little Kicks |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173001/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=804 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Chicken Roaster]]" which portrays the ''[[Kenny Rogers Roasters]]'' chicken restaurant which opened during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=808 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516045149/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=808 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to [[Burma]] in "[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=801 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516041857/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=801 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in "[[The Money]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=813 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219023930/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=813 |archivedate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in "[[The Van Buren Boys]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=814 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130032028/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=814 |archivedate=November 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in "[[The Muffin Tops]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=821 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Muffin Tops |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173006/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=821 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final season included episodes like "[[The Merv Griffin Show (Seinfeld)|The Merv Griffin Show]]" in which Kramer converts his apartment into a talk-show studio and plays the character of talk-show host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=906 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031219/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=906 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Betrayal]]" that presents in reverse chronological order what happened to Sue Ellen's wedding in India, and "[[The Frogger]]" in which George pushes a ''[[Frogger]]'' machine across the street, mimicking the action of the game itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=918 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Frogger |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173013/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=918 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last season included a story arc in which Elaine has an on/off relationship with [[David Puddy|Puddy]].

A major controversy caused in this final season was the accidental burning of a [[Puerto Rican flag]] by Kramer in "[[The Puerto Rican Day]]". This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. Jerry Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in "Inside Look" on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=920 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Puerto Rican Day |accessdate=2008-10-25 |publisher=Sony pictures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150849/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=920 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the episode would be added to the syndicated rerun package several years later uncut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2002/10/30/forbidden-seinfeld-puerto-rican-flag-burning-episode-slips-back-on-air/ |title=Forbidden 'Seinfeld'; Puerto Rican Flag Burning Episode Slips Back On Air |last=Starr |first=Michael |publisher=New York Post |date=October 30, 2002 |access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series finale===
{{Main|The Finale (Seinfeld)}}
After nine years on the air, NBC and Jerry Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Jerry Seinfeld was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's first issue of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101980112,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Jerry Seinfeld|date=1998-01-12|accessdate=2007-05-17|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ended with a seventy-five-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]], in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a forty-five-minute retrospective clip show, "[[The Chronicle (Seinfeld)|The Chronicle]]", was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.

It was the first episode since the finale of season seven, "[[The Invitations]]", to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Jerry Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping in order to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written "vows of silence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9804/08/seinfeld.email/|title=The 'Seinfeld' e-mail for April 8, 1998|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=1998-04-08|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The producers of the show tweaked the media about the hype, spreading a false rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b36158_clues_seinfeld_sign_off.html|title=Clues to "Seinfeld" Sign Off|author=Ryan, Joal|publisher=[[E!

The final episode enjoyed a historic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Seinfeld's' Finale Ends Up in Sixth Place of All Time|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/16/entertainment/ca-50143|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = May 16, 1998|access-date = 2015-04-28|issn = 0458-3035|language = en|first = Brian|last = Lowry}}&lt;/ref&gt; audience, estimated at 76.3 million viewers (58% of all viewers that night) making it the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States#Most watched series finales|fourth most watched regular series finale]] in U.S. TV history, behind ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storyline—a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a "[[Good Samaritan law]]" and sentenced to prison terms.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-08/news/9903090088_1_top-earning-forbes-jerry-seinfeld|title=Seinfeld's $267 Million Tops Celebrity-pay List In Forbes|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1999-03-08|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season.

===Syndication===
According to [[Barry Meyer]], chairman of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], ''Seinfeld'' made $2.7 billion through June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/07/jerry-seinfeld-rerun-repeat-fees|title=TV show Seinfeld earn $2.7bn from reruns|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=7 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2017|02}} the show has made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication. [[Steve Bannon]], who invested in the show, later said, "We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication. We were wrong by a factor of five".&lt;ref name="craw20170208"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/08/steve-bannon-is-still-making-money-from-seinfeld-reruns/ |title=Steve Bannon is still making money from 'Seinfeld' reruns |last=Craw |first=Victoria |date=2017-02-08 |work=The New York Post |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Seinfeld'' began as a twenty-three-minute pilot titled ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]''. Created by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]], developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Battaglio, Stephen (June 30, 2014). "'Annoying' 'Disorienting' 'Boring': On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Cahuenga]] studios, the same studio where ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' was filmed (this was seen by the crew as a good omen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Rob Reiner]]|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 &amp; 2: Inside Looks – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN&gt;{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 &amp; 2: Notes about Nothing – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in [[Burbank, California]] in early 1989. It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]].'' [[Brandon Tartikoff]] was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as "Too New York, too Jewish". Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as "weak", which [[Warren Littlefield]], then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called "a dagger to the heart".&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; Comments included, "You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat"; "Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character"; "Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast"; and "Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?"&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt; Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, "We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment."&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt;

Around the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured [[Ann Jillian]] in her almost-similarly eponymous [[Ann Jillian (TV series)|TV series]]. After ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. ''Ann Jillian'' would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/seinfeld-finale-at-20-hidden-tales-vault-a-comedians-bizarro-world-1111377 |title='Seinfeld' Finale at 20: Hidden Tales From the Vault of a Comedian's Bizarro World |last=Freeman|first=Marc |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 13, 2018 |website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=Castle Rock, which owned the series, had two pilots at NBC that year: Seinfeld and one with Ann Jillian. Whereas Seinfeld tested poorly, Ann Jillian tested through the roof and earned a 13-episode commitment. Castle Rock decided to focus on that.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When NBC announced its 1989&amp;ndash;90 primetime schedule in May 1989, ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' was not included, but supporters of the show didn't give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'',&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; receiving a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all TVs in use at the time were tuned into it.&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt; The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the [[Bob Hope]] specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'', which formed the rest of [[Seinfeld (season 1)|the show's first season]] (the series was by then retitled to just ''Seinfeld''); &lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Mike|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723085248/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-23|title=Give thanks for 'The 'Seinfeld' Story'|publisher=azcentral.com|date=2004-11-24|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move without which ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Phil Rosenthal]] later stated there would be no ''Seinfeld''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-21/business/0508210218_1_warren-littlefield-rick-ludwin-head-of-nbc-entertainment |author= Rosenthal, Phil |authorlink= Phil Rosenthal |date= August 21, 2005 |title= NBC executive stands apart by taking stands|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt;), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; The show was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'', but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, "The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits."

When it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season.&lt;ref name="S1&amp;2DVD-NAN" /&gt; NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|title=Seinfeld: The Unlikeliest Success Story|publisher=American Heritage|date=2006-05-31|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315041818/http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|archivedate=2008-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that "this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made ''Seinfeld'' a cultural phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillette|first=Britt|url=http://www.articlecity.com/articles/music_and_movies/article_518.shtml|title=Seinfeld (Seasons 1 &amp; 2) DVD Review|publisher=Article City|date=2006-09-20|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|HD}}High-definition versions==
There are two [[High-definition television|high-definition]] versions of ''Seinfeld''. The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14589923#post14589923|title='Seinfeld' in HD on TBS HD! Page 2|publisher=videojanitor|accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable network [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] began airing the syndicated version of ''Seinfeld'' in HD. Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the [[35 mm film]] source, to use the entire 16:9 frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116201359/http://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2013-01-16|title=Seinfeld goes HD on TBS HD|date=2008-09-03|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
Elizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of ''Seinfeld'' with recourse to the [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory]] of humor: "The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Magnotta, Elizabeth and Alexandra Strohl| title = A linguistic analysis of humor: A look at ''Seinfeld''| url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/WPLC/article/view/5944|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on "[[The Marine Biologist]]", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on "[[The Red Dot]]", where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater.

Nod Miller, of the [[University of East London]], has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:

{{quote|Seinfeld is suffused with postmodern themes. To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|'The Pilot']], an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, ''Jerry''. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Miller, Nod| title = Applying Insights from Cultural Studies to Adult Education: What Seinfeld Says About the AERC| url = http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140624022756/http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = June 24, 2014| publisher = Adult Education Research Conference| accessdate = August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[TV Guide]]'' named it the [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|greatest TV show of all time]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bootie Cosgrove-Mather|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|publisher=CBS News|date=2002-04-26|accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, they ranked it as the second greatest TV show.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Consumer products==
A recurring feature of ''Seinfeld'' was its inclusion of specific products, especially [[candy]], as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., [[Junior Mints]], [[Twix]], [[Jujyfruits]], bite size [[3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)|Three Musketeers]], [[Snickers]], [[Nestlé Chunky]], [[Oh Henry!]], [[Drake's Cakes|Drake's]] Coffee Cake and [[PEZ]]), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. [[Oh Henry!]] bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., [[Chuckles]], [[Clark Bar]], [[Twinkies]]). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.

The show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. "I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie", explained ''Seinfeld'' writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in ''The Hollywood Reporter''. "At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A look at some of the biggest hits in movie and TV product placement|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2005-04-28|accessdate=2007-11-10|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisers capitalized on the popularity of ''Seinfeld''. [[American Express]] created a [[webisode]] where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated [[Superman]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]], who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the [[Contraceptive sponge|Today Sponge]] created the "Spongeworthy" game, on their website, inspired by "[[The Sponge]]". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a [[Chrysler]] commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with [[Lee Iacocca]] plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for [[Vodafone]] which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.

In addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] brand called "Hennigan's" (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Hennessy]]" and "[[Brannigans]]") and a [[canned meat]] product called "Beef-a-reeno" (a parody of "[[Chef Boyardee|Beef-a-roni]]").

===Streaming on Hulu===
On April 29, 2015, it was officially announced, during [[Hulu]]'s [[upfront (advertising)|upfronts]] presentation in [[New York City|New York]], that all nine seasons of Seinfeld would be available for [[Streaming media|online streaming]], via the video service, starting in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8513149/seinfeld-streaming-exclusively-hulu|title=Hulu confirms it's the exclusive streaming home of Seinfeld|author=Jacob Kastrenakes|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hulu/status/593416595621453825|title=hulu on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was first reported by ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', citing the deal at around $130 million to $180 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/28/8512345/hulu-reportedly-lands-streaming-rights-to-all-180-seinfeld-episodes|title=Hulu reportedly lands streaming rights to all 180 Seinfeld episodes|author=Sam Byford|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2015, [[Hulu]] announced that every episode would be available, on June 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hulu/status/601058892932485120|title=Sweet Fancy Moses, every "Seinfeld" episode is on #hulu 6/24.

=== Streaming on Stan ===
On November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service [[Stan (company)|Stan]] announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/StanAustralia/status/795732579492110336|title=Stan. on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; All episodes were available from November 11, 2016 with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.com.au/stan-seinfeld-sony-pictures/|title=180 Seinfeld episodes come to Stan with new Sony Pictures Television deal |website=www.mediaweek.com.au|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio.

==After ''Seinfeld''==

===Another scene===
On the November 1, 2007, episode of ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene, after they leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but didn't announce what the scene would entail, as its production isn't a certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode dated 1 November 2007|series=The Daily Show|serieslink=The Daily Show|network=[[Comedy Central]]|credits=Axler, Rachel; Bleyer, Kevin; Blomquist, Richard; Bodow, Steve; Carvell, Tim; Havlan, J.R.; Scott Jacobson, Scott; Javerbaum, David; Karlin, Ben; Kutner, Rob; Lieb, Josh; Means, Sam; Reich, Jason; Ross, Jason; Stewart, Jon|airdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In commentary from the final season [[DVD]], Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying "That was brutal" in reference to the foursome's stint in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Seinfeld (season 9)|Seinfeld Season 9]]: Notes about Nothing&amp;nbsp;– "The Finale"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for Jerry behind bars after being transferred to the fictional prison portrayed on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saturday Night Live season 25]]&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly four-minute sketch shows the opening credits for the HBO series with clips of Jerry mixed in doing various activities around the prison. The sketch continues and mixes in different story lines from both ''Oz'' and ''Seinfeld'' and has Jerry interacting with various characters from the show in his typical quick-witted, sarcastic way.&lt;ref&gt;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99aoz.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Seinfeld'' "curse"===
&lt;!--"SEINFELD CURSE" SECTION — PLEASE NOTE BEFORE EDITING: This section deals exclusively with "Seinfeld curse" shows, that is, shows 1] starring Jason, Michael and Julia in title roles, 2] following directly upon the end of Seinfeld, 3] and which were quickly canceled. DO ''not'' add other shows here, especially shows currently in production; add them above.--&gt;
Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term ''Seinfeld curse'': the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's ''Seinfeld'' popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the ''Seinfeld curse'' are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', Jason Alexander's ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' and ''[[Listen Up! (TV series)|Listen Up!]]'', and Michael Richards' ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]''. Larry David said of the curse, "It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html|title='Curb's' Larry David: 'Seinfeld' Curse 'Idiotic'|author=Baerg, Greg|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=2002-03-05|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of [[Larry David]]'s HBO program ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'' led many to believe that she had broken the curse.&lt;ref&gt;Susman, Gary (21-03-2006) "[http://popwatch.ew.com/2006/03/21/old_christine_c/ Has Julia Louis Dreyfus broken the 'Seinfeld' curse?]" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Retrieved on 29-08-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, "I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b53166_Emmys_Clock_into_quot24quot_quotOfficequot.html|author=Hall, Sarah|title=Emmys Clock into "24", "Office"|publisher=[[E! News]]|date=2006-08-27|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced [[100 episodes|enough episodes]] to air in [[rerun]]s in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/cbs-cancels-shows-including-ghost-53669|title=CBS cancels seven shows, including 'Ghost,' 'Case'|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President [[Selina Meyer]] in HBO's comedy series ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/julia-louis-dreyfus-wins-emmy-lead-actress-comedy-series-1202559690/|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes Emmy history|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=September 18, 2016|website=Variety|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Curb Your Enthusiasm''===
{{Main|Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|Seinfeld (Curb Your Enthusiasm)}}
Early in March 2009, it was announced that the ''Seinfeld'' cast would reunite for [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|season seven]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/03/05/seinfeld-cast-t/|author=Rice, Lynette|title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'|publisher=[[EW.com]]|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing their real life selves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a ''Seinfeld'' reunion show as a ploy to get his ex-wife, Cheryl, back. Along with the four main characters, some ''Seinfeld'' supporting actors like  [[Wayne Knight]], [[Estelle Harris]] and [[Steve Hytner]] appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Though much dialogue in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the ''Seinfeld'' special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by ''Seinfeld'' regular [[Andy Ackerman]], making this the first time since ''Seinfeld'' went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.

===''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee''===
{{Main|Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee#ep22|l1=The Over-Cheer (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee)}}
Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, playing their respective ''Seinfeld'' characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] on February 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="Superbowl"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/business/media/halftime-brings-a-much-anticipated-seinfeld-reunion.html?_r=0|title=Halftime Brings a Much-Anticipated 'Seinfeld' Reunion|date=Feb 2, 2014|accessdate=Feb 2, 2014|first=Bill|last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year.&lt;ref name="Superbowl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2550745/Jerry-Seinfeld-dines-best-friend-George-Costanza-Toms-Restaurant-nemesis-Newman-shows-up.html|title=Seinfeld reunited!

[[Image:Musorgsky 1874 b.jpg|thumb|185px|Mussorgsky in 1874]]
'''''Songs and Dances of Death''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Песни и пляски смерти'''}}, ''Pesni i plyaski smerti'') is a [[song cycle]] for voice (usually [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] or [[bass-baritone]]) and [[piano]] by [[Modest Mussorgsky|Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], written in the mid-1870s, to poems by [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov]], a relative of the composer.

Each song deals with death in a poetic manner although the depictions are [[realism (art)|realistic]] in that they reflect experiences not uncommon in 19th century Russia: child death, death in youth, drunken [[poverty|misadventure]] and [[war]].

The song cycle is considered Mussorgsky's masterpiece in the genre.

==Songs==
''Songs and Dances of Death'' consists of four individual songs, as follows:

1. ''[[Lullaby]]'' (''Колыбельная'') (14 April 1875) (in [[F-sharp minor]]–[[A minor]])
:A mother cradles her sick infant, who grows more feverish. [[Death (personification)|Death]] appears, disguised as a babysitter, and rocks the infant to eternal sleep.
2. ''[[Serenade]]'' (''Серенада'') (11 May 1875) (in [[E minor]]–[[E-flat minor]])
:The figure of Death waits outside the window of a dying woman, in the manner of a wooing lover.
3. ''[[Tropak|Trepak]]'' (''Трепак'') (17 February 1875) (in [[D minor]])
:A drunken peasant stumbles outside into the snow and becomes caught in a blizzard. The figure of Death invites him to dance a folk-dance called the Trepak. As he freezes to death, he dreams of summer fields and [[doves as symbols|doves]].
4. ''The [[Field Marshal]]'' (''Полководец'') (5 June 1877) (in [[E-flat minor]]–[[D minor]])
:The figure of Death is depicted as an officer commanding the dead troops of both armies after a dreadful battle. As the dead troops parade before him, he asserts his enduring remembrance of them all.

==Recordings==

The ''Songs and Dances of Death'' have been recorded by numerous vocalists, including [[Vladimir Rosing]], [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]],&lt;ref&gt;George London in Concert, VAI Audio VAIA 1030.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]],&lt;ref&gt;Rachmaninoff Mussorgsky Songs Ferruccio Furlanetto, Igor Tchetuev.

==Versions by others==
*1882, [[Alexander Glazunov]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]
:The songs were first orchestrated by Glazunov (Nos. 1 and 3) and Rimsky-Korsakov (Nos. 2 and 4) shortly after Mussorgsky's death. They were published in 1882. Mussorgsky had intended to orchestrate the cycle himself but never realised the ambition. In the Glazunov/Rimsky-Korsakov orchestration, 'Trepak' is first.
*1962, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]
:Shostakovich orchestrated the whole cycle for the dedicatee, [[soprano]] [[Galina Vishnevskaya]].  Seven years later, noting that he wanted to continue Mussorgsky's "too short" set of songs, he wrote his [[Symphony No. 14 (Shostakovich)|Fourteenth Symphony]] for soprano, bass and chamber orchestra, adding to the musical gallery of death's appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Volkov, Solomon, ''St. Petersburg: A Cultural History'' (New York: The Free Press, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1995), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shostakovich orchestration had a substantial influence on many of his later works, and has since been adapted for [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] and [[baritone]] voices.
*1983, [[Edison Denisov]], recorded by [[Yevgeny Nesterenko]] in 1985
*1984, [[Kalevi Aho]]
*1994, [[Ramon Lazkano]] (premiered by Dmitri Hvorostovsky)
*2007, [[Alexander Raskatov|Aleksandr Raskatov]]
*2012, [[Peter Breiner]] in a version for orchestra only, recorded by him and the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] on [[Naxos]].

'''''The Light of the World''''' (1851–53) is an [[allegorical]] painting by the English Pre-Raphaelite artist [[William Holman Hunt]] (1827–1910) representing the figure of [[Jesus]] preparing to knock on an overgrown and long-unopened door, illustrating [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 3:20: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me". According to Hunt: "I painted the picture with what I thought, unworthy though I was, to be by Divine command, and not simply as a good Subject."&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forbes|first=Christopher|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/5671917/images-christ-nineteenth-century|title=Images of Christ In Nineteenth-Century British Paintings In The Forbes Magazine Collection|journal=Magazine Antiques|date=December 2001|volume=160|issue=6|page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside, representing "the obstinately shut mind".{{sfn|Hunt|1905|p=350}} Hunt, 50 years after painting it, felt he had to explain the symbolism.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/light.html|work=[[Victorian Web]]|title=The Light of the World|date=December 2001|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
The original is variously said to have been painted at night in a makeshift hut at [[Worcester Park House|Worcester Park Farm]] in Surrey and in the garden of the [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;ref name=EO&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]|title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford|The Encyclopædia of Oxford]]|location=London|publisher=Macmillan|year=1988|isbn=0-333-39917-X|pages=20, 197, 208-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it is suggested that Hunt found the dawn light he needed outside [[Bethlehem]] on one of his visits to the Holy Land.&lt;ref name=CHT&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapel History and Treasures|url=http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/about/chapel/chapel-history-and-treasures|publisher=Keble College|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oil on canvas, it was begun around 1849/50,&lt;ref name=CHT/&gt; completed in 1853, exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in 1854 and is now in a side room off the large chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]].{{Sfn|Hunt|1905|pp=299–300}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Dalton|title=Frommer's France and the Best of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtkCnODXfH8C&amp;pg=PT349|accessdate=2013-01-19|date=2012-08-21|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-33137-8|pages=349–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was donated to the college by the widow of [[Thomas Combe]], Printer to the University of Oxford, [[Tractarian]] and a patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, in the year following his death in 1872&lt;ref name=EO/&gt; on the understanding that it would hang in the chapel (constructed 1873&amp;ndash;76) but the building's architect [[William Butterfield]] was opposed to this and made no provision in his design. When the college's library opened in 1878 it was placed there, and was moved to its present position only after the construction in 1892–5 by another architect, [[J. T. Micklethwaite]], of the side chapel to accommodate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Chapel|url=http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/about/tour/inside-chapel|publisher=Keble College|accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the college at that time charged a fee to view it&lt;ref name=EO/&gt; persuaded Hunt toward the end of his life to paint a larger, life-size, version, begun about 1900 and completed in 1904, which was purchased by shipowner and social reformer [[Charles Booth (social reformer)|Charles Booth]] and hung in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[London]], where it was dedicated in 1908 after a 1905&amp;ndash;07 world tour where the picture drew large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Light of the World|url=https://www.stpauls.co.uk/history-collections/the-collections/collections-highlights/the-light-of-the-world|publisher=St Paul's Cathedral|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that four-fifths of Australia's population viewed it.&lt;ref name=LF&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Fulford|authorlink=Robert Fulford (journalist)|title=The Light fantastic: Loved but neglected painting of Jesus became a touchstone of mass culture|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/2007-12-24-hunt.html|work=[[National Post]]|date=2007-12-24|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Hunt's increasing infirmity and [[glaucoma]], he was assisted in the completion of this version by English painter [[Edward Robert Hughes]] (who also assisted with Hunt's version of ''The Lady of Shalott''). Hunt was buried in St Paul's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Holman Hunt|work=Find A Grave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11800|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, smaller version of the painting, painted by Hunt in pastels between 1851 and 1856, is on display at [[Manchester City Art Gallery]], England, which purchased it in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Light of the World|url=http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-light-of-the-world-205246#|work=Art UK|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting gave rise to much popular devotion in the late Victorian period and inspired several musical works, including [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s 1873 [[oratorio]] ''[[The Light of the World (Sullivan)|The Light of the World]]''.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt; Engraved reproductions were widely hung in nurseries, schools and church buildings.&lt;ref name=LF/&gt;

'''''The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed''''' is a 2015 ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling book written by [[Shea Serrano]] and illustrated by [[Arturo Torres (artist)|Arturo Torres]].

==Development==
''The Rap Year Book'' followed Serrano's 2013 project with [[Houston]] rapper [[Bun B]], ''Bun B's Rap Coloring and Activity Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacher|first1=Danielle|title=Q&amp;A: Bun B on the 'Incredible Journey' of Creating His Hip-Hop Coloring Book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-bun-b-on-the-incredible-journey-of-creating-his-hip-hop-coloring-book-20130618|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rap Year Book'' took 15 months to develop,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Euse|first1=Erica|title=How 'The Rap Year Book' Breaks Down the Most Important Rap Songs for Each Year Since 1979|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2015/10/a-look-inside-the-rap-year-book|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=Complex|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was still without an illustrator three months before the book's due date. Serrano encountered eventual collaborator Torres via a flyer Torres had designed announcing a performance by [[Dallas]] rap group The Outfit, Texas; Serrano told ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that on seeing Torres's work, he thought immediately, "This is the exact style that I’m trying to find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Dan|title=Music Monday: Shea Serrano On 'The Rap Yearbook' And His Houston Hip Hop Playlist|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/music-monday-shea-serrano-on-the-rap-yearbook-and-his-houston-hip-hop-playlist/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Texas Monthly|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano contacted the group's management asking for information about who had made their flyer and eventually tracked Torres down on social media; Torres agreed to work on the book.

==Publication==
''The Rap Year Book'' was published on October 13, 2015, by [[Abrams Image]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiewe|first1=Jessie|title=Here's How One Writer Spent Way Too Long Deciding the Best Rap Song Every Year from 1979 to 2014 {{!}} NOISEY|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/shea-serrano-interview-rap-yearbook|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Noisey|publisher=Vice|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 240 pages with 150 full-color illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rap Year Book The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed|url=https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/rap-year-book_9781419718182/|website=Abrams Books|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The book is structured around essays by Serrano selecting the most important rap song for every year from 1979 to 2014.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; His text is accompanied by illustrations by Torres, "bright, colorful, and offbeat cartoons...featuring depictions of [[Kanye]] and [[Jay-Z]] on a movie poster, [[Dr. Dre]] in scrubs, [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] using a pottery wheel, and more."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Colin|title='The Rap Year Book' Reformats Hip-Hop History|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-rap-year-book-by-shea-serrano/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=PopMatters|date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice-T]] wrote the book's preface,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and critics, including [[Wesley Morris]] and [[Jessica Hopper]], contributed short rebuttals arguing for alternative choices as the most important song of a given year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Reviews===
''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the book as "both educationally useful and shamelessly fun...tailor-made to counter every criticism levied against routine, overly generalized music retrospectives."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Oliver Wang said that while Serrano's essays take a position on what constitutes the most important song of each year, "he doesn’t browbeat his reader into agreement; he writes confidently but not condescendingly. More importantly, the main pleasure in reading ''The Rap Year Book'' isn’t in agreeing with Serrano’s choices but rather in following the elliptical paths he takes to explain them."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Oliver|title=Top Five, Dead or Alive|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/top-five-dead-or-alive/|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Ages of Woman''''' is a painting by [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist painter]] and one of the most prominent members of the [[Vienna Secession]] movement. that was completed in Austria in 1905.

==Description ==
The work features three women in varying stages of age, symbolizing the cycle of life. The three women are central on the canvas and are the focal point of the work. The background has a lack of depth, making it look very two dimensional. The colors are neutral and create a restful effect.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt,33.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimt's common use of colorful motifs is also evident in this work. There are two vertical auras that the women are in. The two younger women are in a blue aura that has a fluid pattern of cool colors. The old woman is in an aura by herself, and it is filled with a less fluid pattern with more distinct separations in the design. The colors of this aura are warm, earthy tones that contrast with the cool colors of the other aura. The woman and the auras overlap slightly. The leg of the young woman goes behind the left aura and the old woman's head comes in front of the right aura.

The youngest figure, a child, is connected to the young woman who is her mother. They are the only two touching, they also have sheer blue fabric draped down their legs. Both of these women also have their eyes closed. The young woman has flowers around her head which represent spring.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Her hair is bright an voluminous, contrasting with that of the old woman who is separated from the other two women. Her head is turned away and facing down. The effects of old age are obvious through her sagging skin, bloated belly, and prominent veins. She is also unlike the other two in the fact that both of her feet are shown. This was done so the viewer can see the ugliness of her age in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klimt, and the Vienna Secession==
The artist, [[Gustav Klimt]], was a prominent Austrian painter who was born in 1862. He worked as an apprentice of Ferdinand Laufberger during the early part of his art career. Later he was a founding member and the first president of the [[Vienna Secession]] from 1897 to 1903. He and fellow artist formed the secession after leaving  Künstlerhaus, or the Corporation of Austrian Artists due to differences in views. The Secession held many exhibitions and also founded a magazine titled [[Ver Sacrum]], which translates as sacred spring. Here they published many writers and artists all while sharing the views of the Vienna Secession. Klimt left the Vienna Secession in 1905, the same year that ''The Three Ages of Woman'' was completed.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Art Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical elements==
This is an oil on canvas painting that measures 180 by 180 centimeters. It shows signs of an impasto painting technique that was common of Klimt's work. His painting methods included mixing drying solvents into the paint to make sure there was no unwanted glossy appearance. He also would retouch works, which limited how many paintings he was able to create per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Art Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Three Ages of Woman'' falls into Klimt's Golden Period which includes other works such as ''[[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]]''. This period was characterized by high ornamentation and the use of gold and metallic paints.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt; This work also suggest that it is part of the Art Nouveau movement due to the time period and the decorative elements. The Painting is located in Rome at the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]].&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;
