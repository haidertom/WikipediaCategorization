'''Advanced Placement Spanish Literature and Culture''' (often referred to as '''AP Spanish Literature and Culture''', '''AP Spanish Literature''', '''AP Spanish Lit''' or '''AP SpLit''') is a [[high school]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==The course==
This course is based on improving skills in written Spanish and critical reading of advanced [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] and [[Latin American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically taught as a Spanish V or VI course. The AP Spanish Literature course is designed to be comparable to a third-year college/university introductory Hispanic literature course. Students concentrate on developing proficiency in reading and writing in preparation for the AP Spanish Literature examination. In addition, this course emphasizes mastery of linguistic competencies at a very high level of proficiency.

The course has a required reading list that draws from a variety of sources, including such well-known authors and poets as [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Miguel de Unamuno]], as well as a miscellany of lesser-known short stories, poems, and novels. A complete list of the [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/219542.html readings] is regulated annually by the College Board.  The course is meant to be taught entirely in Spanish, though [http://siempreleer.blogspot.com/ English translations] of the stories are often common resources for students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/spanish_lit/reading.html AP: Spanish Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exam==
The exam is divided into two sections with several parts. Section I, consisting of 65 multiple-choice questions, is split into two parts. Part A (15 questions) is the listening component, which includes a twice-recited poem, a recording of an interview with an author, and a presentation concerning a topic that relates to the course. Part B (50 questions) is reading comprehension based on a wide variety of works, including a literary criticism and selections from works that are not on the required reading list. 80 minutes is given for the entire section.&lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Section II is free-response, containing two short-answer questions and two longer essays. The first question is based on an excerpt from a work on the required reading list, and students must name the author, identify the time period, and, most importantly, elaborate on the theme presented in the passage (15 minutes). The second question asks students to read an excerpt from a work on the required reading list and compare the theme presented to that of an accompanying piece of artwork (15 minutes). The third question tests students' ability to link a piece of literature on the required reading list to the greater genre or movement to which it belongs (35 minutes). Finally, the fourth question directs students to analyze the literary techniques in two excerpts, one of which is from a work on the required reading list, that are used to convey a shared theme (35 minutes). 100 minutes is allotted for this section.&lt;ref&gt;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-spanish-literature-and-culture/about-the-exam&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the test is approximately 3 hours in duration.

'''Atmospheric dispersion modeling''' is the [[computer simulation|mathematical simulation]] of how [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] disperse in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It is performed with computer programs that include [[algorithm]]s to solve the mathematical equations that govern the pollutant dispersion. The [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dispersion models]] are used to estimate the downwind ambient [[concentration]] of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases. They can also be used to predict future concentrations under specific scenarios (i.e. changes in emission sources). Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making. They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere. For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability (i.e. have very steep distance to source decay such as [[black carbon]]) and for [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.

Dispersion models are important to governmental agencies tasked with protecting and managing the ambient [[air quality]]. The models are typically employed to determine whether existing or proposed new industrial facilities are or will be in compliance with the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) in the [[United States]] and other nations. The models also serve to assist in the design of effective control strategies to reduce [[Emission standards|emissions]] of harmful air pollutants. During the late 1960s, the Air Pollution Control Office of the U.S. EPA initiated research projects that would lead to the development of models for the use by urban and transportation planners.&lt;ref&gt;Fensterstock, J.C. et al., [http://pubs.awma.org/gsearch/journal/1971/7/21_07_395.pdf "Reduction of air pollution potential through environmental planning"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JAPCA, Vol.21, No.7, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; A major and significant application of a roadway dispersion model that resulted from such research was applied to the [[Spadina Expressway]] of Canada in 1971.

Air dispersion models are also used by public safety responders and emergency management personnel for emergency planning of accidental chemical releases. Models are used to determine the consequences of accidental releases of hazardous or toxic materials, Accidental releases may result in fires, spills or explosions that involve hazardous materials, such as chemicals or radionuclides. The results of dispersion modeling, using worst case [[accidental release source terms]] and meteorological conditions, can provide an estimate of location impacted areas, ambient concentrations, and be used to determine protective actions appropriate in the event a release occurs. Appropriate protective actions may include evacuation or [[shelter in place]] for persons in the downwind direction. At industrial facilities, this type of consequence assessment or emergency planning is required under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]] (CAA) codified in Part 68 of Title 40 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

The dispersion models vary depending on the mathematics used to develop the model, but all require the input of data that may include:
* [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions such as wind speed and direction, the amount of atmospheric [[turbulence]] (as characterized by what is called the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Characterization of atmospheric turbulence|"stability class"]]), the ambient air temperature, the height to the bottom of any [[Temperature inversion|inversion]] aloft that may be present, cloud cover and solar radiation.
* Source term (the concentration or quantity of toxins in emission or [[accidental release source terms]]) and temperature of the material
* Emissions or release parameters such as source location and height, type of source (i.e., fire, pool or vent stack)and exit [[velocity]], exit temperature and [[mass flow rate]] or release rate.
* Terrain elevations at the source location and at the receptor location(s), such as nearby homes, schools, businesses and hospitals.
* The location, height and width of any obstructions (such as buildings or other structures) in the path of the emitted gaseous plume, surface roughness or the use of a more generic parameter "rural" or "city" terrain.

Many of the modern, advanced dispersion modeling programs include a [[Preprocessor (CAE)|pre-processor]] module for the input of meteorological and other data, and many also include a post-processor module for graphing the output data and/or [[Plot (graphics)|plotting]] the area impacted by the air pollutants on maps. The plots of areas impacted may also include [[isopleths]] showing areas of minimal to high concentrations that define areas of the highest health risk. The isopleths plots are useful in determining protective actions for the public and responders.

The atmospheric dispersion models are also known as atmospheric diffusion models, air dispersion models, air quality models, and air pollution dispersion models.

==Atmospheric layers==

Discussion of the layers in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is needed to understand where airborne pollutants disperse in the atmosphere. The layer closest to the Earth's surface is known as the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|troposphere]]''. It extends from sea-level to a height of about 18&amp;nbsp;km and contains about 80 percent of the mass of the overall atmosphere. The ''[[Earth's atmosphere|stratosphere]]'' is the next layer and extends from 18&amp;nbsp;km to about 50&amp;nbsp;km. The third layer is the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|mesosphere]]'' which extends from 50&amp;nbsp;km to about 80&amp;nbsp;km. There are other layers above 80&amp;nbsp;km, but they are insignificant with respect to atmospheric dispersion modeling.

The lowest part of the troposphere is called the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)]]'' or the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|planetary boundary layer (PBL)]]'' . The air temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude until it reaches what is called a ''[[Capping inversion|inversion layer]]'' (where the temperature increases with increasing altitude) that caps the [[Convective Boundary Layer]], typically to about 1.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;km in height. The upper part of the troposphere (i.e., above the inversion layer) is called the ''free troposphere'' and it extends up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere). In tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime, the [[Free convective layer]] can comprises the entire troposphere, which is up to 10 km to 18 km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]].

The ABL is of the most important with respect to the emission, transport and dispersion of airborne pollutants. The part of the ABL between the Earth's surface and the bottom of the inversion layer is known as the mixing layer. Almost all of the airborne pollutants emitted into the ambient atmosphere are transported and dispersed within the mixing layer. Some of the emissions penetrate the inversion layer and enter the free troposphere above the ABL.

In summary, the layers of the Earth's atmosphere from the surface of the ground upwards are: the ABL made up of the mixing layer capped by the inversion layer; the free troposphere; the stratosphere; the mesosphere and others. Many atmospheric dispersion models are referred to as ''boundary layer models'' because they mainly model air pollutant dispersion within the ABL. To avoid confusion, models referred to as ''mesoscale models'' have dispersion modeling capabilities that extend horizontally up to a few hundred kilometres. It does not mean that they model dispersion in the mesosphere.

==Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation==

The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C.H. and Pearson, J.L., "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation did not assume [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.

Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, O.G., "The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere", QJRMS, 73:257, 1947 and "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", QJRMS, 73:426, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.

Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent [[Clean Air Act (United States)|environmental control regulations]], there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the '''Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes]]''' shown below:&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above equation not only includes upward reflection from the ground, it also includes downward reflection from the bottom of any inversion lid present in the atmosphere.

The sum of the four exponential terms in &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; converges to a final value quite rapidly. For most cases, the summation of the series with ''m'' = 1, ''m'' = 2 and ''m'' = 3 will provide an adequate solution.

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the atmospheric stability class (i.e., a measure of the turbulence in the ambient atmosphere) and of the downwind distance to the receptor. The two most important variables affecting the degree of pollutant emission dispersion obtained are the height of the emission source point and the degree of atmospheric turbulence. The more turbulence, the better the degree of dispersion.

The classification of stability class is proposed by F. Pasquill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=W|first1=Klug|title=Atmospheric Diffusion (3rd Edition). F. Pasquill and F. B. Smith. Ellis Horwood, (John Wiley &amp; Sons) Chichester, 1983|date=April 1984|publisher=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six stability classes are referred to:
A-extremely unstable
B-moderately unstable
C-slightly unstable
D-neutral
E-slightly stable
F-moderately stable

The resulting calculations for [[air pollutant concentrations]] are often expressed as an [[air pollutant]] concentration [[contour line|contour map]] in order to show the spatial variation in contaminant levels over a wide area under study.  In this way the contour lines can overlay sensitive receptor locations and reveal the spatial relationship of air pollutants to areas of interest.

Whereas older models rely on stability classes (see [[air pollution dispersion terminology]]) for the determination of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;, more recent models increasingly rely on the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]] to derive these parameters.

==Briggs plume rise equations==

The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation (discussed above) requires the input of ''H'' which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H
is the sum of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus Δ''H'' (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]

To determine Δ''H'', many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as "the Briggs equations." G.A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "A plume rise model compared with observations", JAPCA, 15:433–438, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by CONCAWE (a Dutch organization), he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas", Atmos. Envir., 2:228–232, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade&lt;ref&gt;Slade, D.H. (editor), "Meteorology and atomic energy 1968", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models.  That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Plume Rise", USAEC Critical Review Series, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as "the Briggs equations".  Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Some recent analyses of plume rise observation", Proc. Second Internat'l. Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings", Atmos. Envir., 6:507–510, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Briggs divided air pollution plumes into these four general categories:
* Cold jet plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Cold jet plumes in windy ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in windy ambient air conditions

Briggs considered the trajectory of cold jet plumes to be dominated by their initial velocity momentum, and the trajectory of hot, buoyant plumes to be dominated by their buoyant momentum to the extent that their initial velocity momentum was relatively unimportant.  Although Briggs proposed plume rise equations for each of the above plume categories, '''''it is important to emphasize that "the Briggs equations" which become widely used are those that he proposed for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes'''''.

In general, Briggs's equations for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes are based on observations and data involving plumes from typical combustion sources such as the [[Flue gas|flue gas stacks]] from steam-generating boilers burning [[fossil fuel]]s in large power plants.  Therefore, the stack exit velocities were probably in the range of 20 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft/s (6 to 30&amp;nbsp;m/s) with exit temperatures ranging from 250 to 500&amp;nbsp;°F (120 to 260&amp;nbsp;°C).

A logic diagram for using the Briggs equations&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; to obtain the plume rise trajectory of bent-over buoyant plumes is presented below:

The '''Battle of the Styles''' is a term used to refer to the conflict between supporters of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] and the [[Classical architecture|Classical style]] in architecture. In Britain this led to public debates between [[Decimus Burton]] and [[Augustus Pugin]]. 

Later in the century the revival of [[vernacular architecture]] led to an increasing palette of styles from which architects could choose, including [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] and "[[Tudorbethan]]" models. Numerous stylistic options led to a debate about [[prefabricated]] stylistic options in architecture, which eventually mutated into the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style and then into [[Modernism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20469">'''Bioinorganic chemistry''' is a field that examines the role of [[metal]]s in [[biology]]. Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of [[metalloprotein]]s as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are [[essential element|non-essential]], in [[medicine]] and [[toxicology]].

As a mix of [[biochemistry]] and [[inorganic chemistry]], bioinorganic chemistry is important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer [[protein]]s, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties in biological chemistry.

==Composition of living organisms==
About 99% of [[mammals]]' mass are the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], [[potassium]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name=Heymsfield&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heymsfield S, Waki M, Kehayias J, Lichtman S, Dilmanian F, Kamen Y, Wang J, Pierson R |title=Chemical and elemental analysis of humans in vivo using improved body composition models |journal=[[American Journal of Physiology]] |volume=261 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=E190–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1872381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]]s ([[proteins]], [[lipids]] and [[carbohydrates]]) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.&lt;ref name=Heymsfield/&gt;  The entire collection of metal-containing [[biomolecules]] in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] is called the [[metallome]].

==History==
[[Paul Ehrlich]] used [[organoarsenic]] (“arsenicals”) for the treatment of [[syphilis]], demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine, that blossomed with Rosenberg’s discovery of the anti-cancer activity of [[cisplatin]] (cis-PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The first protein ever crystallized (see [[James B. Sumner]]) was [[urease]], later shown to contain nickel at its [[active site]].  [[Cyanocobalamin|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], the cure for [[pernicious anemia]] was shown crystallographically by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] to consist of a cobalt in a [[corrin]] macrocycle.  The Watson-Crick structure for [[DNA]] demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers.

==Themes in bioinorganic chemistry==
Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry.  Major areas include:

===Metal ion transport and storage===
This topic covers a diverse collection of [[ion channel]]s, ion pumps (e.g. [[NaKATPase]]), [[vacuole]]s, [[siderophore]]s, and other [[protein]]s and small molecules which control the concentration of metal ions in the cells.  One issue is that many metals that are metabolically required are not readily available owing to solubility or scarcity.  Organisms have developed a number of strategies for collecting such elements and transporting them.

===Enzymology===
Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are [[metalloprotein]]s.  Often the reacting water is a ligand (see [[metal aquo complex]]).  Examples of [[hydrolase]] enzymes are [[carbonic anhydrase]], metallo[[phosphatase]]s, and [[metalloproteinase]]s.  Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the function of these metalloproteins.

Metal-containing electron transfer proteins are also common.  They can be organized into three major classes: [[iron-sulfur protein]]s (such as [[rubredoxin]]s, [[ferredoxin]]s, and [[Rieske protein]]s), blue [[copper proteins]], and [[cytochrome]]s. These electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron transporters [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD). The [[nitrogen cycle]] make extensive use of metals for the redox interconversions.

===Toxicity===
Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Maret |first1= Wolfgang|chapter= Chapter 1. The Bioinorganic Chemistry of Lead in the Context of its Toxicity|publisher= de Gruyter|publication-date= 2017|series= Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=17|title=Lead: Its Effects on Environment and Health|editor1-last=Astrid|editor1-first= S.|editor2-last=Helmut|editor2-first=S.|editor3-last=Sigel |editor3-first= R. K. O.|doi=10.1515/9783110434330-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Oxygen transport and activation proteins===
{{Main article|Transition metal dioxygen complex}}
Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese.  [[Heme]] is utilized by [[red blood cell]]s in the form of [[hemoglobin]] for oxygen transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology.  Other oxygen transport systems include [[myoglobin]], [[hemocyanin]], and [[hemerythrin]].  [[Oxidase]]s and [[oxygenase]]s are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation in [[cytochrome c oxidase]] or small molecule oxidation in [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s or [[methane monooxygenase]].  Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as [[hydrogen peroxide]].  These systems include [[peroxidase]]s, [[catalase]]s, and [[superoxide dismutase]]s.  A complementary metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the [[oxygen evolving complex]] present in plants.  This system is part of the complex protein machinery that [[Oxygen evolution|produces oxygen]] as plants perform [[photosynthesis]].
[[Image:Myoglobin.png|right|220px|thumb|Myoglobin is a prominent subject in bioinorganic chemistry, with particular attention to the iron-heme complex that is anchored to the protein.]]

===Bioorganometallic chemistry===
[[Bioorganometallic chemistry|Bioorganometallic]] systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the [[hydrogenase]]s, [[FeMoco]] in nitrogenase, and [[methylcobalamin]].  These naturally occurring [[organometallic compounds]].  This area is more focused on the utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are significant in [[environmental chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sigel |editor-first=A. |editor2=Sigel, H. |editor3=Sigel, R.K.O. |title=Organometallics in Environment and Toxicology|publisher=RSC publishing|location=Cambridge|year=2010|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=7|isbn=978-1-84755-177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FeMoco cluster.svg|thumb|right|160px|Structure of [[FeMoco]], the catalytic center of nitrogenase.]]

===Metals in medicine===
{{Main article|Metals in medicine}}
A number of drugs contain metals.  This theme relies on the study of the design and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely used anti-cancer drug is [[cisplatin]].  [[MRI contrast agent]] commonly contain [[gadolinium]].  [[Lithium carbonate]] has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder.  Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. [[auranofin]] have been commerciallized.  [[Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]] are metal complexes have been developed to suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide.  The [[cardiovascular]] and [[neuron]]al importance of [[nitric oxide]] has been examined, including the enzyme [[nitric oxide synthase]]. (See also: [[nitrogen assimilation]].) Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been tested against several parasite strains. &lt;ref name="pmid29227923"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Méndez-Arriaga JM, Oyarzabal I, etal |title=In vitro leishmanicidal and trypanocidal evaluation and magnetic properties of 7-amino-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine Cu(II) complexes |journal=J.

===Environmental chemistry===
{{main article|Environmental chemistry}}
Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy metals with organisms.  [[Methylmercury]] has caused major disaster called [[Minamata disease]]. [[Arsenic poisoning]] is a widespread problem owing largely to [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], which affects many millions of people in developing countries.  The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing compounds involves [[cobalamin]]-based enzymes.

===Biomineralization===
{{main article|Biomineralization}}
Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce [[mineral]]s, often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called [[mineralized tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Types of inorganic elements in biology==

===Alkali and alkaline earth metals===
[[Image:Monensin2.png|210 px|thumb|left|Like many antibiotics, [[monensin]]-A is an ionophore that tighlty bind Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (shown in yellow).&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The abundant inorganic elements act as [[ion]]ic [[electrolyte]]s. The most important ions are [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[chloride]], [[phosphate]], and [[bicarbonate]]. The maintenance of precise [[ion gradient|gradients]] across [[cell membrane]]s maintains [[osmotic pressure]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sychrová H |title=Yeast as a model organism to study transport and homeostasis of alkali metal cations |url=http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/53%20Suppl%201/53_S91.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Physiol Res |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S91–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15119939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions are also critical for [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s, as [[action potential]]s in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the [[extracellular fluid]] and the [[cytosol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitan I |title=Modulation of ion channels in neurons and other cells |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=11 |issue= |pages=119–36 |year=1988 |pmid=2452594 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.001003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called [[ion channels]].

===Main group compounds===
Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active.  Sulfur and phosphorus are required for all life.   Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and its various [[ester]]s.  Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) down to sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  Selenium is a trace element involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The CCDS project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they are consistently represented by the National Center for Biotechnology Information [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|(NCBI)]], [[Ensembl]], and [[UCSC Genome Browser]].&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; The integrity of the CCDS dataset is maintained through stringent [[#Quality assurance testing|quality assurance testing]] and on-going [[#Manual curation|manual curation]].&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harte|first1=RA|last2=Farrell|first2=CM|last3=Loveland|first3=JE|last4=Suner|first4=MM|last5=Wilming|first5=L|last6=Aken|first6=B|last7=Barrell|first7=D|last8=Frankish|first8=A|last9=Wallin|first9=C|last10=Searle|first10=S|last11=Diekhans|first11=M|last12=Harrow|first12=J|last13=Pruitt|first13=KD|title=Tracking and coordinating an international curation effort for the CCDS project.|journal=Database |date=2012|volume=2012|pages=bas008|doi=10.1093/database/bas008|pmid=22434842|pmc=3308164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation and background==

Biological and biomedical research has come to rely on accurate and consistent annotation of genes and their products on genome assemblies.  Reference annotations of genomes are available from various sources, each with their own independent goals and policies, which results in some annotation variation.

The CCDS project was established to identify a gold standard set of protein-coding gene annotations that are identically annotated on the human and mouse [[reference genome]] assemblies by the participating annotation groups.  The CCDS gene sets that have been arrived at by consensus of the different partners &lt;ref name=Second /&gt; now consist of over 18,000 human and over 20,000 mouse genes (see [[#CCDS release history|CCDS release history]]).  The CCDS dataset is increasingly representing more [[alternative splicing]] events with each new release.&lt;ref name=third&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=CM|last2=O'Leary|first2=NA|last3=Harte|first3=RA|last4=Loveland|first4=JE|last5=Wilming|first5=LG|last6=Wallin|first6=C|last7=Diehans|first7=M|last8=Barrell|first8=D|last9=Searle|first9=SM|last10=Aken|first10=B|last11=Hiatt|first11=SM|last12=Frankish|first12=A|last13=Suner|first13=MM|last14=Rajput|first14=B|last15=Steward|first15=CA|last16=Brown|first16=GR|last17=Bennet|first17=R|last18=Murphy|first18=M|last19=Wu|first19=W|last20=Kay|first20=MP|last21=Hart|first21=J|last22=Rajan|first22=J|last23=Weber|first23=J|last24=Snow|first24=C|last25=Riddick|first25=LD|last26=Hunt|first26=T|last27=Webb|first27=D|last28=Thomas|first28=M|last29=Tamez|first29=P|last30=Rangwala|first30=SH|last31=McGarvey|first31=KM|last32=Pujar|first32=S|last33=Shkeda|first33=A|last34=Mudge|first34=JM|last35=Gonzale|first35=JM|last36=Gilbert|first36=JG|last37=Trevaion|first37=SJ|last38=Baetsch|first38=R|last39=Harrow|first39=JL|last40=Hubbard|first40=T|last41=Ostell|first41=JM|last42=Haussler|first42=D|last43=Pruitt|first43=KD|title=Current status and new features of the Consensus Coding Sequence database.|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|date=2014|volume=42|pages=D865-D872|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1059|pmid=24217909|pmc=3965069|issue=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the CCDS gene set==

"Consensus" is defined as protein-coding regions that agree at the start codon, stop codon, and splice junctions, and for which the prediction meets quality assurance benchmarks.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; A combination of manual and automated genome annotations provided by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|(NCBI)]]
and [[Ensembl]] (which incorporates manual HAVANA annotations) are compared to identify annotations with matching genomic coordinates.

==Quality assurance testing==

In order to ensure that CDSs are of high quality, multiple quality assurance (QA) tests are performed (Table 1).  All tests are performed following the annotation comparison step of each CCDS build and are independent of individual annotation group QA tests performed prior to the annotation comparison.&lt;ref name=third /&gt;

Annotations that fail QA tests undergo a round of manual checking that may improve results or reach a decision to reject annotation matches based on QA failure.

==Review process ==

The CCDS database is unique in that the review process must be carried out by multiple collaborators, and agreement must be reached before any changes can be made.  This is made possible with a collaborator coordination system that includes a work process flow and forums for analysis and discussion. The CCDS database operates an internal website that serves multiple purposes including curator communication, collaborator voting, providing special reports and tracking the status of CCDS representations.  When a collaborating CCDS group member identifies a CCDS ID that may need review, a voting process is employed to decide on the final outcome.

==Manual curation==

Coordinated manual curation is supported by a restricted-access website and a discussion e-mail list.  CCDS curation guidelines were established to address specific conflicts that were observed at a higher frequency.  Establishment of CCDS curation guidelines has helped to make the CCDS curation process more efficient by reducing the number of conflicting votes and time spent in discussion to reach a consensus agreement.  A link to the CCDS curation guidelines can be found [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/docs/CCDS_curation_guidelines.pdf here].

Curation policies established for the CCDS data set have been integrated in to the [[RefSeq]] and HAVANA annotation guidelines and thus, new annotations provided by both groups are more likely to be concordant and result in addition of a CCDS ID.  These standards address specific problem areas, are not a comprehensive set of annotation guidelines, and do not restrict the annotation policies of any collaborating group.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Examples include, standardized curation guidelines for selection of the initiation codon and interpretation of upstream [[open reading frame|ORF]]s and transcripts that are predicted to be candidates for [[nonsense-mediated decay]].  Curation occurs continuously, and any of the collaborating centers can flag a CCDS ID as a potential update or withdrawal.

Conflicting opinions are addressed by consulting with scientific experts or other annotation curation groups such as the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|(HGNC)]] and Mouse Genome Informatics [[Mouse Genome Informatics|(MGI)]].  If a conflict cannot be resolved, then collaborators agree to withdraw the CCDS ID until more information becomes available.

==Curation challenges and annotation guidelines==

'''Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD):'''
[[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] is the most powerful [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] surveillance process. [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] eliminates defective [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] before it can be translated into protein.&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=B|last2=Johnson|first2=A|last3=Lewis|first3=J|last4=Raff|first4=M|last5=Roberts|first5=K|last6=Walter|first6=P|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell 5th edn|date=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if the defective [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] is translated, the truncated protein may cause disease. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]]; one being the [[exon junction complex]] (EJC) model.  In this model, if the stop codon is &gt;50 nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction, the transcript is assumed to be a [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; The CCDS collaborators use a conservative method, based on the EJC model, to screen mRNA transcripts.  Any transcripts determined to be [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidates are excluded from the CCDS data set except in the following situations:&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;
# all transcripts at one particular locus are assessed to be [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidates however the locus is previously known to be protein coding region; 
# there is experimental evidence suggesting that a functional protein is produced from the [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcript.

Previously, [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcripts were considered to be protein coding transcripts by both [[RefSeq]] and HAVANA, and thereby, these [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcripts were represented in the CCDS data set. The [[RefSeq]] group and the HAVANA project have subsequently revised their annotation policies.

'''Multiple in-frame translation start sites:'''
Multiple factors contribute to translation initiation, such as upstream [[open reading frame]]s (uORFs), secondary structure and the sequence context around the translation initiation site.  A common start site is defined within Kozak consensus sequence: (GCC) GCCACCAUGG in vertebrates.  The sequence in brackets (GCC) is the motif with unknown biological impact.&lt;ref name=seventh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozak|first1=M|title=Pushing the limits of the scanning mechanism for initiation of translation.|journal=Gene|date=2002|volume=299|pages=1–34|doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(02)01056-9|pmid=12459250|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations within Kozak consensus sequence, such as G or A is observed three nucleotides upstream (at position -3) of AUG. Bases between positions -3 and +4 of Kozak sequence have the most significant impact on translational efficiency. Hence, a sequence (A/G)NNAUGG is defined as a strong Kozak signal in the CCDS project.

According to the scanning mechanism, the small ribosomal subunit can initiate translation from the first reached start codon. There are exceptions to the scanning model: 
# when the initiation site is not surrounded by a strong Kozak signal, which results in leaky scanning. Thereby, the [[ribosome]] skips this AUG and initiates translation from a downstream start site; 
# when a shorter [[open reading frame|ORF]] can allow the [[ribosome]] to re-initiate translation at a downstream [[open reading frame|ORF]].&lt;ref name=seventh /&gt;

According to the CCDS annotation guidelines, the longest [[open reading frame|ORF]] must be annotated except when there is experimental evidence that an internal start site is used to initiate translation. Additionally, other types of new data, such as ribosome profiling data,&lt;ref name=Ninth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingolia|first1=NT|last2=Brar|first2=GA|last3=Rouskin|first3=S|last4=McGeachy|first4=AM|last5=Weissman|first5=JS|title=Genome-wide Annotation and Quantitation of Translation by Ribosome Profiling.|journal=Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol.|date=2014|volume=Chapter 4|page=Unit–4.18|doi=10.1002/0471142727.mb0418s103|pmid=23821443|pmc=3775365}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to identify start codons. The CCDS data set records one translation initiation site per CCDS ID. Any alternative start sites may be used for translation and will be stated in a CCDS public note.

'''Upstream open reading frames:'''
AUG initiation codons located within transcript leaders are known as upstream AUGs (uAUGs). Sometimes, uAUGs are associated with u[[open reading frame|ORFs]] . u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s are found in approximately 50% of human and mouse transcripts.&lt;ref name=Sixth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvo|first1=SE|last2=Pagliarni|first2=DJ|last3=Mootha|first3=VK|title=Upstream open reading frames cause widespread reduction of protein expression and are polymorphic among humans.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|volume=106|pages=7507–12|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810916106|pmid=19372376|pmc=2669787|issue=18|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/50259/1/Calvo-2009-Upstream%20open%20readin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s are another challenge for the CCDS data set. The scanning mechanism for translation initiation suggests that small ribosomal subunits (40S) bind at the 5’ end of a nascent [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript and scan for the first AUG start codon.&lt;ref name=seventh /&gt; It is possible that an uAUG is recognised first, and the corresponding uORF is then translated. The translated u[[open reading frame|ORF]] could be a [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate, although studies have shown that some u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s can avoid [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]]. The average size limit for u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s that will escape [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] is approximately 35 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eighth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=AL|last2=Pereira|first2=FJC|last3=Morgado|first3=A|last4=Kong|first4=J|last5=Martins|first5=R|last6=Faustino|first6=P|last7=Liebhaber|first7=SA|last8=Romao|first8=L|title=The canonical UPF1-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is inhibited in transcripts carrying a short open reading frame independent of sequence context.|journal=RNA|date=2006|volume=12|pages=2160–70|doi=10.1261/rna.201406|pmid=17077274|pmc=1664719|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has been suggested that u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s inhibit translation of the downstream gene by trapping a [[ribosome]] initiation complex and causing the [[ribosome]] to dissociate from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript before it reaches the protein-coding regions.&lt;ref name=fourth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; Currently, no studies have reported the global impact of u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s on translational regulation.

The current CCDS annotation guidelines allow the inclusion of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts containing u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s if they meet the following two biological requirements:&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;
# the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript has a strong Kozak signal; 
# the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript is either ≥ 35 [[amino acid]]s or overlaps with the primary [[open reading frame]].

'''Read-through transcripts:'''
Read-through transcripts are also known as [[conjoined gene]]s or co-transcribed genes. Read-through transcripts are defined as transcripts combining at least part of one exon from each of two or more distinct known (partner) genes which lie on the same chromosome in the same orientation.&lt;ref name = Tenth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prakash|first1=Tulika|last2=Sharma|first2=Vineet K.|last3=Adati|first3=Naoki|last4=Ozawa|first4=Ritsuko|last5=Kumar|first5=Naveen|last6=Nishida|first6=Yuichiro|last7=Fujikake|first7=Takayoshi|last8=Takeda|first8=Tadayuki|last9=Taylor|first9=Todd D.|last10=Michalak|first10=Pawel|title=Expression of Conjoined Genes: Another Mechanism for Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes|journal=PLoS ONE|date=12 October 2010|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13284|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013284|pmid=20967262|pmc=2953495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological function of read-through transcripts and their corresponding protein molecules remain unknown. However, the definition of a read-through gene in the CCDS data set is that the individual partner genes must be distinct, and the read-through transcripts must share ≥ 1 exon (or ≥ 2 splice sites except in the case of a shared terminal exon) with each of the distinct shorter loci.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Transcripts are not considered to be read-through transcripts in the following circumstances: 
# when transcripts are produced from [[overlapping genes]] but do not share same splice sites; 
# when transcripts are translated from genes that have nested structures relative to each other. In this instance, the CCDS collaborators and the [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|HGNC]] have agreed that the read-through transcript be represented as a separate locus.

'''Quality of reference genome sequence:'''
As the CCDS data set is built to represent genomic annotations of human and mouse, the quality problems with the human and mouse [[reference genome]] sequences become another challenge. Quality problems occur when the reference genome is misassembled. Thereby the misassembled genome may contain premature [[stop codon]]s, [[frameshift mutation|frame-shift indels]], or likely polymorphic [[pseudogene]]s. Once these quality problems are identified, the CCDS collaborators report the issues to the Genome Reference Consortium, which investigates and makes the necessary corrections.

==Access to CCDS data==

The CCDS project is available from the NCBI CCDS data set page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/ (here)], which provides FTP download links and a query interface to acquire information about CCDS sequences and locations. CCDS reports can be obtained by using the query interface, which is located at the top of the CCDS data set page. Users can select various types of identifiers such as CCDS ID, gene ID, gene symbol, nucleotide ID and protein ID to search for specific CCDS information.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; The CCDS reports (Figure 1) are presented in a table format, providing links to specific resources, such as a history report, [[Entrez|Entrez Gene]] &lt;ref name=Eleventh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maglott|first1=D.|last2=Ostell|first2=J.|last3=Pruitt|first3=K.

The sequence identifiers table presents transcript information in [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|VEGA]], [[Ensembl]] and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/blink.cgi?mode=query Blink]. The chromosome location table includes the genomic coordinates for each individual exon of the specific coding sequence. This table also provides links to several different genome browsers, which allow you to visualise the structure of the coding region.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; Exact nucleotide sequence and protein sequence of the specific coding sequence are also displayed in the section of CCDS sequence data.

==Future prospects==

Long-term goals include the addition of attributes that indicate where transcript annotation is also identical (including the [[Untranslated region|UTRs]]) and to indicate splice variants with different [[Untranslated region|UTRs]] that have the same CCDS ID.  It is also anticipated that as more complete and high-quality genome sequence data become available for other organisms, annotations from these organisms may be in scope for CCDS representation.

The CCDS set will become more complete as the independent curation groups agree on cases where they initially differ, as additional experimental validation of weakly supported genes occurs, and as automatic annotation methods continue to improve. Communication among the CCDS collaborating groups is ongoing and will resolve differences and identify refinements between CCDS update cycles.  Human updates are expected to occur roughly every 6 months and mouse releases yearly.&lt;ref name=third /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24708">Objects used in Jewish rituals are known collectively as [[Judaica]]. The '''conservation and restoration of Judaica''' takes into account the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the written and oral [[Torah]] known as, [[halacha]] in order to properly care for these materials. This work involves identifying these objects and therefore knowing how any of these objects are traditionally handled, stored, exhibited, and generally cared for based on their use and significance. 

==Definition of culturally sensitive objects==
Traditional [[Judaism]] divides ritual objects into two main categories, those that carry holiness; and those that are essential to the performance of a particular ritual or commandment but that have no intrinsic quality that is defined as sacred or holy. Once they are no longer in ritual use and are in the possession of a museum, only some of the objects in the first category are traditionally treated differently from the way other collections are treated. For these pieces, repair or restoration done by a conservator is not common. It is common for almost all other objects, conservation, repair, or restoration to be carried out without restriction.&lt;ref name="Defining"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Virginia|title=Accessories of Holiness: Defining Jewish Sacred Objects|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-01-005.html||website=cool.conservation-us.org|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=January 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the objects below are handled and preventatively conserved is all based on the laws and thoughts of the most strict sect of Judaism as is recommended.

Below is a list of both types of objects with definitions and descriptions to aid in identifying and therefore knowing how any of these objects might be handled and cared for due to their uses and significance. Additionally, these descriptions will aid in understanding the care and handling methods listed below them. 

References are made to [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], and [[Mizrachi Jews]] in this article. Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to communities in central and eastern Europe while Sephardi Jews are those who came originally from the Iberian Peninsula. These Jews were expelled in 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition and settled in places like Greece, Turkey, and what is known as Israel today. Mizrachi Jews are those who trace their ancestry to the Arab world and Iran, as well as those whose families never left Palestine.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;

===Types of sacred and non-sacred objects===
Tashmishey Kedushah is the first category of ritual objects and is defined as "objects which carry holiness" or "accessories of holiness." The most common example of this is the [[Torah]] which is the Five Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=Defining/&gt;  [[File:Open Torah scroll.jpg|thumb|Open Torah scroll]]

The common feature of the objects in this group is that they contain words, specifically the name of God, but by extension, any words "divinely written" or inspired, from which the quality of holiness is derived. Because the nontextual objects surrounding these scrolls all come into contact with them, they also acquire some of the same quality of holiness. The transmission is not indefinite. It extends a maximum of two layers from the text.

Other objects in this category include:
* Torah curtains - Curtains that are in front of the Torah ark and are often decorative in nature but can also be plain. 
* Mantle - A piece of fabric often used to cover a Torah scroll and often made of velvet or another soft material with some type of embroidery. This is used most often by Ashkenazi communities.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;
* Torah binder - A strip of soft fabric, similar to the mantle, that keeps the Torah scroll closed.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; In Italy and in the Sephardi communities, the binder is known as a "fascia"; it is made of a costly material or of linen embroidered in silk thread.&lt;ref name="Virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Torah Ornaments|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/torah-ornaments|website=Jewish Virtual Library: A Project of AICE|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rimonim - Silver and gold ornaments that are placed on the wooden rollers or in Hebrew, "atzei chaim" (trees of life). Many times these are adorned with little bells and are very intricate.&lt;ref name="Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shekel|first1=Michal|title=The Making of a Torah Scroll|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/torah-scroll/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breastplate - A metal shield placed in front of the mantle of the Torah scroll in Ashkenazi communities. This custom did not develop in Sephardi communities because their Torah scrolls were kept in a case (tik)  which did not lend itself to such additional decoration. Symbolic of, and sometimes similar to, the breastplate prescribed for the high priest, the object is often called "ḥoshen mishpat," the Hebrew word for breastplate.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* [[Yad]] - The pointer used by the Torah reader to keep one's place is known as a "yad," in Hebrew, or "hand" in English, in Ashkenazi communities and as the "moreh" or "pointer/teacher" or "Kulmus" or "quill" in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or silver-plated brass, but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* Wood Torah case - Used by Sephardic Jews instead of a fabric mantle allowing the Torah to sit upright when not in use and without the use of a chair or holder as mentioned above. [[File:ShinMezuzahJosephSherman.jpg|thumb|ShinMezuzahJosephSherman]] &lt;ref name="Sephardim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Yehuda|title=Why Do Sephardim Keep Their Torahs in Cylindrical Cases|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3119530/jewish/Why-Do-Sephardim-Keep-Their-Torahs-in-Cylindrical-Cases.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair or holder on which the Torah is placed when it is removed from the ark and not being read. 
* [[Tefillin]]  - Known in English as “phylacteries,” are worn by men in the Orthodox and Conservative movement during morning prayer and on weekdays. This includes a leather case, the biblical texts written on parchment that is inside, the leather straps used to fasten them to the head and arm during prayer (see image of soldier below), and any bag specifically made to hold them and used for that purpose on a regular basis. 
*[[Mezuzah]] - A metal, ceramic, or glass casing in which the handwritten text on parchment or "[[klaf]]" in Hebrew, is held. This object is fastened to the doorpost of a house and, traditionally, to interior doorways as well and marks the home of a Jewish family. 

Bibles, prayer books, volumes of the [[Talmud]], law codes, and commentaries, in a variety of languages, are now also included in this list. In some communities, any document of any kind written in Hebrew letters is also included. This can sometimes also include anything written in [[Yiddish]] which uses the same alphabet.

====Tashmishey Mitzvah====
Tashminey Mitzvah is a category that includes most other ritual objects essential to Jewish life.  Objects include:
*Wine or [[kiddush]] cups used on Sabbath and holidays 
*[[Hanukkah]] [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] 
*[[Seder plate]] 
*[[Shofar]] 
*[[Tallit]] with knotted fringes, called [[tzitzit]].
*[[Lulav]] or a palm branch in English, tied together with willow and myrtle and [[etrog]] (citron) to be used on the Jewish harvest holiday of [[Sukkot]], 
*[[Etrog]] containers - That keep the etrog safe from the "pitam" or "pitom" breaking off making the fruit less valuable and possibly not kosher. 
*Sabbath candlesticks - Used weekly during [[Shabbat]]
*Spice box and candle holder used for the [[Havdalah]] service that marks the end of the Jewish Sabbath, called [[Shabbat]]. 
*[[Challah]] and [[matzah]] covers - Used to cover bread for Shabbat and the holiday of Passover which tells the story of the exodus from Egypt. 
*[[Chuppah]] - or wedding canopy in English

==Preventative conservation ==
Once holy/sacred objects (tashmishey kedusha) leave the Jewish community and enter the care of a museum, it is common practice that this group of objects is divided into two sections. The first section contains the three written texts including the Torah scroll, tefillin, and klaf for the mezuza. (These all are, or contain, biblical texts that were handwritten on parchment, in a particular script, according to rigid rules, by men who are specially trained as scribes (sofrim)). The second section includes all other material, including printed or handwritten documents, Torah mantles, ark curtains, tefillin bags, Torah ornaments, and mezuza cases (see other section below).

In terms of preventative conservation and conservation itself, Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls traditionally are left as they are. According to [[halacha]], once they are no longer in use, there is no reason for them to be kosher—in proper condition to be used—and therefore no reason why missing or abraded letters are restored or minor repairs made to the parchment unless the museum wishes to do as they see it necessary for the safety of the object. 

The repair of other books and documents has often been done with the respect that would characterize any professional conservation treatment. In Judaism, the study of traditional texts is considered to be the equivalent of prayer. To restore any text, whether of aesthetic or historical value or not, to a state in which it can be studied is considered an act of merit whatever the religious or cultural affiliation of the person doing the work. This includes when it will just be on view in an exhibition.

===Torah, Klaf===
If, for the safety of a Torah scroll, it is determined that repairs must be done to the rollers on which the scroll is mounted, traditionally, these repairs are done by a scribe, who will then remounts the parchment onto the roller in the traditional manner. It has been proven that a Torah scroll that has a tear in the parchment does best when it is kept rolled to another part of the scroll. According to tradition, if two pages are separated the two parts of the scroll are most often wrapped and stored separately. If it is considered both possible (considering the condition of the parchment) and essential to rejoin the separated leaves.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

When Torah scrolls, prayer books, or volumes of the [[Talmud]] are in the possession of a Jewish institution, it is a common practice to only photograph (or making photocopies) of open scrolls or pages only for serious study or publication. Once the books and other documents are in an archive, or museum, the rules of the institution apply. These rules are usually based on condition and value, but restrictions on casual copying do exist in all cases.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Tefillin - phylacteries===
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|IDF soldier put on tefillin]] 
It is against halacha to open tefillin unless it is necessary. According to Jewish tradition, the removal and examination of the klaf within the tefillin only occurs when the tefillin are being repaired. The style of the writing can give clues to the registrar or conservator to the time and place in which they were written. Many institutions exhibit tefillin in damaged condition if there is a special reason such as its association with a famous person, or in an exhibit of Holocaust-related material.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Other materials===
Objects in this group are commonly treated by any qualified conservator who will treat Jewish ritual material as anthropological material rather than as art, keeping conservation treatment to a minimum, and avoiding extensive restoration. Any ethical treatment is seen as permitted. It is noted that Conservators in private practice, who may not have the option of minimal treatment, may take on greater responsibility as a result of the above. Original fabric or trimming removed from an ark curtain have traditionally given to the owner for proper disposal. If the owner is unwilling to do this is it common for the responsibility to fall on the conservator to make other arrangements.  

===Holocaust related objects===
Alterations of any kind to an object that survived the Holocaust, unless absolutely necessary to ensure its physical survival, are not made out of respect for the victims. Conservators and collections staff traditionally attempt to do the least amount of conservation on an object from the Holocaust as the damaged state is part of what is seen as telling of the history of the object. Any intervention can be seen as causing a loss of historic and perhaps even esthetic information, and the greater the intervention the greater the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozdeba|first1=Suzzane|title=Uncertain Future|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/76089/uncertain-future|website=Tablet Magazine Online|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Holocaust museums and other museums carrying objects from concentration camps including fragile items like prisoners’ artwork and thousands of documents, shoes, and suitcases, teeth, hair, glasses, luggage, and more, preservation is viewed as an ethical and practical issue. Conservators and registrars alike wrestle with questions about the proper role of restoration. It has been noted that people coming to see these objects don't want to see a replica of how something might have once looked, but they are looking for what it looks like because of what it, and what its owner, went through.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sevy|first1=Dr. Rivka|title=Ethics in Conservation of Original Materials|url=https://ehri-project.eu/ethics-conservation-original-materials|website=ehri-project.eu|publisher=European Holocaust Research Infrastructure|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camps themselves are also considered artifacts to be to preserved as close to how they originally looked while still conserving them. This includes the barracks and other buildings that are exposed to natural conditions like atmosphere, rain, cold, etc. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, it covered 40 square kilometers, with three camps, sub camps, and an additional area that was supervised by SS administration. While some were hesitant to leave the camp as it was because of difficult memories, it was upon the request of former prisoners that the local government keep the former concentration camp intact as a memorial and the Polish government began initiatives to preserve the site, giving the Ministry of Culture and Art the authority to preserve parts of it.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

Alternatively, the conservation of audio or visual records (photographs, films, voice records) is different. The audio or visual recordings of past historical events that are caught as images or sound are not the original as there is no physical original. Because they are the only remaining representation of the events of the holocaust, such as the Nazi Book burnings in the Opernplatz in Berlin,  this media is commonly conserved as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

==Overarching ethical concerns==
Because of certain rules, restrictions, and traditions within the Jewish religion, certain ethical concerns are commonly top-of-mind when caring for sacred Judaica. 

===Kohen restriction===
Many restrictions were designed to maintain what is referred to as ritual purity for Jews who are of the "Priest" holy order in the Temple of Jerusalem. Today, most Jews will know if they come from that [[Kohen]] line, and one might be able to tell from the last name of Cohen, Kohn, Kahn, etc. Many of the laws and practices are still maintained in traditional Judaism. One law that might affect the conservation of objects is that Kohanim are forbidden to be in contact with dead bodies, or be under the same roof as a corpse or any part of one, except in the case of the death of a close relative. This could prevent a conservator or registrar (doing preventative conservation) from caring for objects that are of the human remain nature, but only if it bothers the professional because of his or her background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozovsky|first1=Lorne|title=Raise Your Hand if You're A Kohen|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/762109/jewish/Raise-Your-Hand-If-Youre-A-Kohen.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menstruation and women touching objects===
It is the practice in some ultra-orthodox sects of Judaism that women who are menstruating do not touch any sacred texts for purity reasons. This is only a custom and is not written into Jewish law. Because of this, female conservators are able to work with the texts but remain cognizant of this custom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkovitz|first1=Rahel|title=Can Women Touch the Torah? A Halackic View|url=https://www.jofa.org/Education/TorahTouching|website=Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placement of sacred texts and objects on the floor===
Materials containing: (a) God's name, (b) Three consecutive words of a biblical verse, when written on one line with the intent to quote the verse, or (c) Other written or printed Torah ideas or laws are considered to be holy and, according to Jewish law, are not placed on the floor for any reason. Schoolwork, homework and test papers may be included in this category if they contain any of the above. All these materials are considered holy objects whether they are in Hebrew or another language, in Braille, or on microfilm.&lt;ref name="Chabad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Posner|first1=Menachem|title=Proper Disposal of Holy Objects|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/475304/jewish/Proper-Disposal-of-Holy-Objects.htm%20Chabad.org|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stacking of sacred texts===
Additionally, any materials with God's name are not, according to halacha, stacked one on top of the other in any type of museum storage. Many consider this to be disrespectful to the holy objects.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Exhibition and storage==
While there are few restrictions on the exhibition of Jewish ritual objects and generally none on the examination of this material for purposes of study by anyone of any religion or culture, it is important to mention the exceptions below.

It has been proven that Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls do best if exhibited in an unrolled fashion unless they are deemed no longer fit for ritual use. These objects are generally stored covered with plain cloth or tissue paper in a dark drawer or cabinet and are separated from their holders if a conservator or registrar feels it is unwise to leave them in the same place. A reason for this is if the mantle is deemed unfit to stay on the Torah scroll. It is common practice for a Tefillin that needs to be separated from its bag to be kept in a plain cloth bag for storage. Small Torah scrolls are commonly stored lying down while large ones are kept upright on a rack specifically made to hold their weight.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

Mezuzah scrolls are traditionally kept in their cases or wrapped in tissue.

===Handling and long-term care===
Generally, when taken out for any reason, such as to be examined by a researcher, tashmishey kedusha is treated with respect as any object that is still being used in rituals. The surface on which the objects are placed is covered with a clean cloth or appropriate non-acidic paper, and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

It has been proven that if the parchment is in good enough condition, it's best for the preservation of Torah scrolls and other rolled documents to be completely rolled front to back (or vice versa) and back to the center, once every year or two. This is most commonly done by two people who are experienced in this procedure and under the supervision of a conservator.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
In many Jewish institutions, if it is decided that an object has reached the point of needing conservation, a [[registrar (museum)|museum registrar]] will connect a conservator with an expert in the type of object or in the Judaica field. This pairing of Rabbi with a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]], a religious expert with conservator, or a professor with conservator, is known to creates a more trustworthy situation where the Museum does not have to worry that all Jewish rules are followed. If the conservator has any questions on process, or on what to do and not do, he or she can refer to the assigned expert. 

Instead of contacting a conservator if there are issues with a Torah, specifically involving the writing on the parchment, a registrar or curator will traditionally connect with a [[Sofer Stam]], or a scribe in English. This expert is trained in transcribing the Torah, tefillin, and mezuzahs, and other religious writings. According to Jewish law, or halacha, they are the only people allowed to touch these texts.  Scribes also assemble the Torah scrolls, sewing the sheets of parchment together and mounting them on the rollers, and make the cases for tefillin.&lt;ref name="Strassfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=R.|last2=Strassfeld|first2=M.|last3=Strassfeld|first3=S.|title=The Jewish Catalogue|date=1973|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-accessioning==
When it comes to the deaccessioning process of museum objects that a conservator or other museum professional deems beyond repair, these said objects can be disposed of through destruction. They will be destroyed by the curator or his/her designee. When it comes to disposal of Judaica, there are different rules depending on whether the object is deemed still holy or longer holy and whether they are fit for ritual use, or not fit for ritual use. 

===Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Kedushah)===
If collections professionals have artifacts that are holy Jewish objects containing the name of God (tashmishey kedusha) that have been determined to be beyond conservation and the museum no longer wants them in the collection and would otherwise dispose of them, this is, according to halacha, not allowed. Jewish law instructs how these types of objects are to be "put away"  (O.H. 154.3; Mishneh Torah, II 10.3). 

Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews fulfill this requirement of "putting away" a holy object through burial, either in a specific part of a Jewish cemetery or, in some places, next to or along with a man of exceptional piety and learning.

Many Sephardic/Mizrachi Jewish communities put these objects instead into a special room in the synagogue, called a [[geniza]] (from the root meaning “conceal,” “hide,” or “preserve”). Because this group of objects includes books that are both handwritten and printed, documents, and traditional items, the storage rooms can get quite full.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; The most famous geniza is in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. It held more than 200,000 pages, some dating to the founding of the synagogue in 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica|date=1971|publisher=Keter Publishing House.|location=Jerusalem, Israel|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Mitzvah)===
For the most part, objects that fall under tashmishey mitzvah are discarded when they are no longer fit for ritual use. This is because they have no intrinsic quality of holiness. even though they have value when it comes to Western aesthetics of beauty. One exception to this law is the [[tallit]]. The Shulchan Arukh, a medieval law code (first published 1565) and still considered authoritative by traditional Jews, states that [[tzitzit]], the strings that hang from a tallit are just as holy as the tallit itself and is treated as such.

[[File:White blood cell undergoing cytolysis, 2014-10-18.webm|thumb|A human white blood cell (upper right) in water swells until it bursts (at ~14 seconds)]]
'''Cytolysis''', or '''osmotic lysis''', occurs when a cell [[lysis|bursts]] due to an [[osmosis|osmotic imbalance]] that has caused excess water to diffuse into the cell.  Water can enter the cell by diffusion through the cell membrane or through selective membrane channels called aquaporins, which greatly facilitate the flow of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2014|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8153-4454-4|page=388|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment, where water moves into the cell by [[osmosis]] and causes its volume to increase to the point where the volume exceeds the membrane's capacity and the cell bursts. The presence of a [[cell wall]] prevents the membrane from bursting, so cytolysis only occurs in [[animal]] and [[protozoa]] cells which do not have cell walls. The reverse process is  [[plasmolysis]].

==In mammals==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Osmotic lysis is often one result of a [[stroke]], because of improper nutrient perfusion and waste removal alter cell [[metabolism]]. Such malfunction results in an inflow of [[extracellular fluid]] into the cells.

==In bacteria==
Osmotic lysis would be expected to occur when bacterial cells are treated with a hypotonic solution with added [[lysozyme]], which destroys the bacteria's cell walls.

==Prevention==
Different cells and organisms have adapted different ways of preventing cytolysis from occurring. For example, the [[paramecium]] uses a [[contractile vacuole]], which rapidly pumps out excessive water to prevent the build-up of water and the otherwise subsequent lysis.&lt;ref name="campbell134"&gt;{{Cite book|

Other organisms pump solutes out of their [[cytosol]], which brings the solute [[concentration]] closer to that of their environment. This slows down the process of water's diffusion into the cell, preventing cytolysis. If the cell can pump out enough solutes so that an [[Tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic]] environment can be achieved, there will be no net movement of water.

'''Dendrology''' ({{lang-grc|δένδρον}}, ''dendron'', "tree"; and {{lang-grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', ''science of'' or ''study of'') or '''[[xylology]]''' ({{lang-grc|ξύλον}}, ''ksulon'', "wood") is the science and study of [[Woody plant|wooded plants]] ([[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, and [[liana]]s), specifically, their taxonomic classifications. There is no sharp boundary between [[plant taxonomy]] and dendrology; however, woody plants not only belong to many different plant [[Family (biology)|families]], but these families may be made up of both woody and non-woody members. Some families include only a few woody [[species]]. Dendrology, as a discipline of industrial forestry, tends to focus on identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic interrelationships.  As an academic course of study, dendrology will include all woody plants, native and non-native, that occur in a region.  A related discipline is the study of sylvics, which focuses on the autecology of [[genus|genera]] and species.

== Relationship with botany ==

Dendrology is often confused with [[botany]]. However, botany is the study of all types of general plants, while dendrology studies only woody plants. Dendrology may be considered a subcategory of botany that specializes in the characterization and identification of woody plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

The '''''Dialogus de oratoribus''''' is a short work attributed to [[Tacitus]], in [[dialogue]] form, on the art of [[rhetoric]]. Its date of composition is unknown, though its dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] places its publication around 102 AD.

The dialogue itself, set in the 70s AD, follows the tradition of [[Cicero]]'s speeches on philosophical and rhetorical arguments.&lt;ref name=Tarrant1987&gt;{{citation | last=Tarrant | first=R. J. | year=1987 | title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 90 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-37937-4 | page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the home of [[Curiatius Maternus]], one of the speakers, to whom two leading lawyers of the day, [[Marcus Aper]] and [[Julius Secundus]], have come to discuss a recent event; the fourth speaker, [[Gaius Vipstanus Messalla Gallus]], arrives later. All four men are attested historical personages. The beginning of the work is a speech in defence of eloquence and poetry. It then deals with the decadence of oratory, for which the cause is said to be the decline of the education, both in the family and in the school, of the future orator. The education is not as accurate as it once was; the teachers are not prepared and a useless rhetoric often takes the place of the general culture.

After a [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the ''Dialogus'' ends with a speech delivered by Maternus reporting what some believe is Tacitus's opinion. Maternus thinks that great oratory was possible with the freedom from any power, more precisely in the [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]], that characterized the [[Roman Republic]] during the civil wars. It became anachronistic and impracticable in the quiet and ordered society that resulted from the institution of the [[Roman Empire]]. The peace, warranted by the Empire, should be accepted without regret for a previous age that was more favorable to the wide spread of literacy and the growth of great personality.

Some believe that at the base of all of Tacitus's work is the acceptance of the Empire as the only power able to save the state from the chaos of the civil wars. The Empire reduced the space of the orators and of the political men, but there is no viable alternative to it. Nevertheless, Tacitus does not accept the imperial government apathetically, and he shows, as in the ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the remaining possibility of making choices that are dignified and useful to the state.

The date of publication of the ''Dialogus'' is uncertain, but it was probably written after the ''Agricola'' and the ''Germania''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so much so that the its authenticity may be questioned, even if it is always grouped with the ''Agricola'' and the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' in the manuscript tradition. The way of speaking in the ''Dialogus'' seems closer to the model of Cicero, refined but not prolix, which inspired the teaching of [[Quintilian]]; it lacks the incongruities that are typical of Tacitus's major historical works. It may have been written when Tacitus was young; its dedication to Fabius Iustus would thus give the date of publication, but not the date of writing. More probably, the unusually classical style may be explained by the fact that the ''Dialogus'' is a work of rhetoric. For this genre the structure, the language, and the style of Cicero were the usual models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Ecosharing''' is an environmental ethic for people to live by: that their own impact on the Earth’s [[biosphere]] be limited to no more than their own fair ecoshare. The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his ''Living in the Environment'' text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jr., G. Tyler ''Living in the Environment'' CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 book ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' sought to quantify an "ecoshare" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectworldview.org/comingofage.htm Cook, Stephen P. and Meadows, Donella H. ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' AR: Parthenon Books, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's [[carbon footprint]]. However it is gauged, an ecoshare is determined by overall assessment of the human impact on the biosphere, computer models of its future condition, and necessary limits imposed by [[sustainability]] criteria.

The '''Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002''' ('''FISMA''', {{usc|44|3541}}, ''et seq.'') is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 2002 as Title III of the [[E-Government Act of 2002]] ({{USPL|107|347}}, {{USStat|116|2899}}). The act recognized the importance of [[information security]] to the economic and national security interests of the United States.&lt;ref name="nist_overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/overview.html |title=NIST: FISMA Overview |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act requires each [[Government agency#Government agencies in the United States|federal agency]] to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide [[information security]] for the information and [[information systems]] that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, [[Government contractor|contractor]], or other source.&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt;

FISMA has brought attention within the federal government to [[cybersecurity]] and explicitly emphasized a "risk-based policy for cost-effective security."&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt; FISMA requires agency program officials, chief information officers, and inspectors general (IGs) to conduct annual reviews of the agency's information security program and report the results to [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB). OMB uses this data to assist in its oversight responsibilities and to prepare this annual report to Congress on agency compliance with the act.&lt;ref name="omb"&gt;FY 2005 Report to Congress on Implementation of The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2008, federal agencies spent $6.2 billion securing the government's total information technology investment of approximately $68 billion or about 9.2 percent of the total information technology portfolio.&lt;ref name="omb08"&gt;FY 2008 Report to Congress on Implementation of The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

This law has been replaced by the [[Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014]] ({{USPL|113|283}}), sometimes known as FISMA2014 or FISMA Reform. FISMA2014 struck subchapters II and III of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, amending it with the text of the new law in a new [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/chapter-35/subchapter-II subchapter II] ({{usc|44|3551}}). 

==Purpose of the act==

FISMA assigns specific responsibilities to [[Government agency#Government agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) in order to strengthen information security systems. In particular, FISMA requires the head of each agency to implement policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce information technology security risks to an acceptable level.&lt;ref name="omb"/&gt;

According to FISMA, the term ''information security'' means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide integrity, confidentiality and availability.

==Implementation of FISMA==

In accordance with FISMA, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, excluding national security systems. NIST works closely with federal agencies to improve their understanding and implementation of FISMA to protect their information and information systems and publishes standards and guidelines which provide the foundation for strong information security programs at agencies. NIST performs its statutory responsibilities through the Computer Security Division of the Information Technology Laboratory.&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov |title=NIST Computer Security Division 2008 report |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST develops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs to promote, measure, and validate the security in information systems and services. NIST hosts the following:
* FISMA implementation project&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt;
* [[Information Security Automation Program]] (ISAP)
* [[National Vulnerability Database]] (NVD) – the U.S. government content repository for ISAP and [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g., FISMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvd.nist.gov/ |title=National Vulnerability Database |publisher=Nvd.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance framework defined by FISMA and supporting standards==
FISMA defines a framework for managing information security that must be followed for all [[information system]]s used or operated by a U.S. federal government agency in the executive or legislative branches, or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of a federal agency in those branches. This framework is further defined by the standards and guidelines developed by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]].&lt;ref name="fisma"&gt;The 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory of information systems===
FISMA requires that agencies have an information systems inventory in place.
According to FISMA, the head of each agency shall develop and maintain an inventory of major information systems (including major national security systems) operated by or under the control of such agency&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt;
The identification of information systems in an inventory under this subsection shall include an identification of the interfaces between each such system and all other systems or networks, including those not operated by or under the control of the agency.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; The first step is to determine what constitutes the "[[information system]]" in question. There is not a direct mapping of computers to an information system; rather, an information system may be a collection of individual computers put to a common purpose and managed by the same system owner. NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"&gt;NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1, "Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems"&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidance on determining [[system]] boundaries.

===Categorize information and information systems according to risk level===
All information and information systems should be categorized based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt;
The first mandatory security standard required by the FISMA legislation, [[FIPS 199]] "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems"&lt;ref name="Catalog of FIPS publications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html |title=Catalog of FIPS publications |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the definitions of security categories. The guidelines are provided by NIST SP 800-60 "Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html |title=Catalog of NIST SP-800 publications |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall FIPS 199 system categorization is the "high water mark" for the impact rating of any of the criteria for information types resident in a system.  For example, if one information type in the system has a rating of "Low" for "confidentiality," "integrity," and "availability," and another type has a rating of "Low" for "confidentiality" and "availability"  but a rating of "Moderate" for "integrity," then the impact level for "integrity" also becomes "Moderate".

===Security controls===
Federal information systems must meet the minimum security requirements.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; These requirements are defined in the second mandatory security standard required by the FISMA legislation, [[FIPS 200]] "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems".&lt;ref name="Catalog of FIPS publications"/&gt;
Organizations must meet the minimum security requirements  by selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described in [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]], "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems". The process of selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements for organizational information systems to achieve adequate security is a multifaceted, risk-based activity involving management and operational personnel within the organization.
Agencies have flexibility in applying the baseline security controls in accordance with the tailoring guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. This allows agencies to adjust the security controls to more closely fit their mission requirements and operational environments.
The controls selected or planned must be documented in the System Security Plan.

===Risk assessment===
The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires a foundational level of security for all federal information and information systems. The agency's risk assessment validates the security control set and determines if any additional controls are needed to protect agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of "security due diligence" for the federal agency and its contractors.&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;NIST SP 800-53A "Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;
A risk assessment starts by identifying potential [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and mapping implemented [[security control|controls]] to individual vulnerabilities.  One then determines risk by calculating the likelihood and impact that any given vulnerability could be exploited, taking into account existing controls.  The culmination of the risk assessment shows the calculated risk for all vulnerabilities and describes whether the risk should be accepted or mitigated.  If mitigated by the implementation of a control, one needs to describe what additional Security Controls will be added to the system.

NIST also initiated the Information Security Automation Program (ISAP) and [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP) that support and complement the approach for achieving consistent, cost-effective security control assessments.

===System security plan===
Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; NIST SP-800-18 introduces the concept of a System Security Plan.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt; System security plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and plans of action and milestones for implementing security controls. Procedures should be in place outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan current, and follows up on planned security controls.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt;

The System security plan is the major input to the security certification and accreditation process for the system. During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security plan is analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the security controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS 199 security category determined for the information system, and that the threat and vulnerability identification and initial risk determination are identified and documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt;

===Certification and accreditation===
Once the system documentation and risk assessment has been completed, the system's controls must be reviewed and certified to be functioning appropriately. Based on the results of the review, the information system is accredited. The certification and accreditation process is defined in NIST SP 800-37 "Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems".&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"&gt;NIST SP 800-37 "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt;
Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Required by [[OMB Circular A-130]], Appendix III, security accreditation provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staffs at all levels to implement the most effective security controls possible in an information system, given mission requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and cost/schedule constraints. By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core principles that characterize security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials have the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those systems.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"/&gt;

The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation is developed during a detailed security review of an information system, typically referred to as security certification. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security accreditation decision.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"/&gt;

===Continuous monitoring===
All accredited systems are required to monitor a selected set of security controls and the system documentation is updated to reflect changes and modifications to the system. Large changes to the security profile of the system should trigger an updated risk assessment, and controls that are significantly modified may need to be re-certified.

Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system components, security impact analyses of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also establishes the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved.

==Critique==
Security experts Bruce Brody, a former federal chief information security officer, and Alan Paller, director of research for the [[SANS Institute]], have described FISMA as "a well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed tool", arguing that the compliance and reporting methodology mandated by FISMA measures security planning rather than measuring information security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mar 18, 2007 |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2007/03/18/FISMAs-effectiveness-questioned.aspx?Page=2 |title=Government Computer News, FISMA efficiency questioned, 2007 |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2007-03-18 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] chief technology officer Keith Rhodes said that FISMA can and has helped government system security but that implementation is everything, and if security people view FISMA as just a checklist, nothing is going to get done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun 10, 2009 |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/06/15/Interview-Keith-Rhodes-IT-security.aspx?sc_lang=en&amp;Page=2 |title=Government Computer News, Effective IT security starts with risk analysis, former GAO CTO says |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film studies''' is an academic discipline that deals with various [[film theory|theoretical]], [[history of film|historical]], and [[film criticism|critical]] approaches to [[film]]s.  It is sometimes subsumed within [[media studies]] and is often compared to [[television studies]]. Film studies is less concerned with advancing proficiency in [[Filmmaking|film production]] than it is with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Richard. "Introduction." Film Studies: Critical Approaches. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2000. 1-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In searching for these social-ideological values, film studies takes a series of critical approaches for the analysis of production, theoretical framework, context, and creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sikov, Ed. "Introduction." Introduction pg.1-4. Film Studies: an Introduction. New York: Columbia UP, 2010. Print. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zbCK8ETCWzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=film+studies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BwjJTJG1GsH7lwef1Yn3Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the film studies discipline exists as one in which the teacher does not always assume the primary educator role; the featured film itself serves that function. Also, in studying film, possible careers include critic or production. [[Film theory]] often includes the study of conflicts between the aesthetics of visual Hollywood and the textual analysis of screenplay. Overall the study of film continues to grow, as does the industry on which it focuses. Academic journals publishing film studies work include ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', ''[[Screen (journal)|Screen]]'', ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' and ''[[Journal of Film and Video]]''.

==History==
Film studies as an academic discipline emerged in the twentieth century, decades after [[History of film technology#First_motion_pictures|the invention of motion pictures]]. Not to be confused with the technical aspects of film production, film studies exists only with the creation of [[film theory]]—which approaches film critically as an art—and the writing of [[film historiography]]. Because the modern film became an invention and industry only in the late nineteenth century, a generation of film producers and [[Film director|directors]] existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.

Early [[film school]]s focused on the production and subjective critique of film rather than on the critical approaches, history and theory used to study academically. Since the time film was created, the concept of film studies as a whole grew to analyze the formal aspects of film as they were created. Established in 1919 the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Moscow Film School]] was the first school in the world to focus on film. In the United States the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], established in 1929, was the first cinematic based school, which was created in agreement with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. They were also the first to offer a major in film in 1932 but without the distinctions that are assumed in film studies. Universities began to implement different forms of cinema related curriculum without, however, the division between the abstract and practical approaches.

The ''Deutsche Filmakademie Babelsberg'' (i.e. German Film Academy Babelsberg) was founded in the Third Reich in 1938. Among the lecturers were e.g. [[Willi Forst]] and [[Heinrich George]]. To complete the studies at the Academy a student was expected to create his own film.

A movement away from [[Hollywood]] productions in the 1950s turned cinema into a more artistic [[independent films|independent]] endeavor. It was the creation of the [[auteur theory]], which asserted film as the director's vision and art, that prompted film studies to become truly considered academically worldwide in the 1960s. In 1965, film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], in his writings on [[Alfred Hitchcock]], declared that Hitchcock's films contained the same complexities of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Study in the Undergraduate Curriculum''. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1983.15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jean Luc Godard]], a contributor to the influential magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinema]]'' wrote, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With stable enrollment, proper budgets and interest in all [[humanities]] numerous universities contained the ability to offer distinct film studies programs.

There were no individuals that created the criteria for film studies; rather the growing community of the [[film industry]] and academics began to criticize, document and analyze films, eventually conforming the concepts of film studies that pertain to artistic academia. With the success in first half of the twentieth century, prominent persons in the film industry could become an endowment source for schools focusing primarily on film, creating the location for film studies as a discipline to form. An example is [[George Lucas]]' US$175 million donation to the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |title=LA's Screen Gems |first=Rachel |last=Abramowitz |authorlink= |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |year=2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124180156/http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |archivedate=24 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern film studies==
Today film studies exists worldwide as a discipline with specific schools dedicated to it. The aspects of film studies have grown to encompass numerous methods for teaching history, culture and society. Many [[liberal arts]] colleges and universities and contain courses specifically geared toward the analysis of film.&lt;ref name="colbo"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 18 October 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Also exemplifying the increased diversity of film studies is the fact that high schools across the United States offer classes on [[film theory]]. Many programs conjoin film studies with media and television studies, taking knowledge from all parts of visual production in the approach. With the growing technologies such as [[3-D film]] and [[YouTube]], films are now concretely used to teach a reflection of culture and art around the world as a primary medium. Due to the ever-growing dynamic of film studies, a wide variety of curricula have emerged for analysis of critical approaches used in film.&lt;ref&gt;Grieveson, Lee. "Cinema Studies." ''Inventing Film Studies''. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. 67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although each institution has the power to form the study material, students are usually expected to grasp a knowledge of conceptual shifts in film, a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style, a sense of ideological dimensions of film, and an awareness of extra textual domains and possible direction of film in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dix, Andrew.

==United States film studies==
In the United States, [[universities]] offer courses specifically toward film studies, and schools committed to minor/major programs. Currently 144 different [[tertiary institutions]] nationwide offer a major program in film studies.&lt;ref name="colbo"/&gt; This number continues to grow each year with new interest in the film studies discipline. Institutions offering film degrees as part of their arts or communications curriculum differ from institutions with a dedicated film program. The curriculum is in no way limited to films made in the United States; a wide variety of films can be analyzed. With the United States' film industry second worldwide only to India, the attraction for film studies is high. To obtain a degree in the United States, a person is likely to pursue careers in the production of film, especially [[Film director|directing]] and [[Film producer|producing]] films.&lt;ref&gt;Polan, Dana, and Haidee Wasson. "Young Art, Old Colleges." Inventing Film Studies. Durham: Duke UP, 2008.

Films can reflect the culture of the period not only in the United States but around the world.

==World film studies==
Film studies throughout the world exist in over 20 countries. Due to the high cost of film production [[Third World|third world countries]] are left out of the film industry especially in the academic setting. Despite this fact more prosperous countries have the ability to study film in all the aspects of film studies.   Discourse in film can be found in the schools around the world; often, international attention to the aesthetics of film emerge from [[film festival]]s. For example, the [[Cannes Film Festival]] is the most prestigious in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/cannes_international_film_festival/index.html|title = Cannes International Film Festival|work = New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this discourse revolves around the film industry and promotion and does not exist within an academic school setting, numerous aspects of analysis and critical approaches are taken into account on this international stage.

'''Forensic toxicology''' is the use of [[toxicology]] and other disciplines such as [[analytical chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] and [[clinical chemistry]] to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results. 
A toxicological analysis can be done to various kinds of samples.
A forensic toxicologist must consider the context of an investigation, in particular any physical symptoms recorded, and any evidence collected at a crime scene that may narrow the search, such as pill bottles, powders, trace residue, and any available chemicals. Provided with this information and samples with which to work, the forensic toxicologist must determine which toxic substances are present, in what concentrations, and the probable effect of those chemicals on the person.

Determining the substance ingested is often complicated by the body's natural processes (see [[ADME]]), as it is rare for a chemical to remain in its original form once in the body. For example: [[heroin]] is almost immediately [[metabolism|metabolised]] into another substance and further to [[morphine]], making detailed investigation into factors such as injection marks and chemical purity necessary to confirm diagnosis. The substance may also have been diluted by its dispersal through the body; while a pill or other regulated dose of a drug may have grams or [[milligrams]] of the active constituent, an individual sample under investigation may only contain [[microgram]]s or [[nanogram]]s.

==Examples==

===Urine===
A [[urine]] sample is urine that has come from the bladder and can be provided or taken post-mortem. Urine is less likely to be infected with viruses such as HIV or Hepatitis B than blood samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinis-Oliveira|first=R|author2=Carvalho, F. F. |author3=Duarte, J. A. |author4=Remião, F. F. |author5=Marques, A. A. |author6=Santos, A. A. |author7=Magalhães, T. T |title=Collection of biological samples in forensic toxicology|journal=Toxicology Mechanisms &amp; Methods|year=2010|volume=20|issue=7|pages=363–414|doi=10.3109/15376516.2010.497976}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many drugs have a higher concentration and can remain for much longer in urine than blood. Collection of urine samples can be taken in a noninvasive way which does not require professionals for collection. Urine is used for qualitative analysis as it cannot give any indication of impairment due to the fact that drug presence in urine only indicates prior exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Barry|title=Forensic Toxicology|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=1 March 1993|volume=65|issue=5|doi=10.1021/ac00053a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood===
A blood sample of approximately {{convert|10|ml|2|abbr=on}} is usually sufficient to screen and confirm most common toxic substances. A blood sample provides the toxicologist with a profile of the substance that the subject was influenced by at the time of collection; for this reason, it is the sample of choice for measuring [[blood alcohol content]] in [[drunk driving]] cases.

===Hair sample===
Hair is capable of recording medium to long-term or high dosage substance abuse. Chemicals in the bloodstream may be transferred to the growing hair and stored in the [[hair follicle|follicle]], providing a rough [[Chronology|timeline]] of drug intake events. Head hair grows at rate of approximately 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm a month, and so cross sections from different sections of the follicle can give estimates as to when a substance was ingested. Testing for drugs in hair is not standard throughout the population. The darker and coarser the hair the more drug that will be found in the hair. If two people consumed the same amount of drugs, the person with the darker and coarser hair will have more drug in their hair than the lighter haired person when tested. This raises issues of possible racial bias in substance tests with hair samples.&lt;ref name="Mieczkowski"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://criminology.fsu.edu/journal/mismeasure.pdf |title=The Further Mismeasure: The Curious Use of Racial Categorizations in the Interpretation of Hair Analyses |first=Tom |last=Mieczkowski |work=Paper presented at the American Society of Criminology Meetings, November 1999, Toronto, Ontario, Canada |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508045755/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/journal/mismeasure.pdf |archivedate=2007-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Other bodily fluids and organs may provide samples, particularly samples collected during an [[autopsy]]. A common autopsy sample is the [[gastric content]]s of the deceased, which can be useful for detecting undigested pills or liquids that were ingested prior to death. In highly decomposed bodies, traditional samples may no longer be available. The [[vitreous humour]] from the eye may be used, as the fibrous layer of the eyeball and the eye socket of the skull protects the sample from trauma and adulteration. Other common organs used for toxicology are the brain, liver, and spleen.

The inspection of the contents of the stomach must be part of every postmortem examination if possible because it may provide qualitative information concerning the nature of the last meal and the presence of abnormal constituents. Using it as a guide to the time of death, however, is theoretically unsound and presents many practical difficulties, although it may have limited applicability in some exceptional instances. Generally, using stomach contents as a guide to time of death involves an unacceptable degree of imprecision and is thus liable to mislead the investigator and the court.
Characteristic cell types from food plants can be used to identify a victim's last meal; knowledge about which can be useful in determining the victim's whereabouts or actions prior to death (Bock and Norris, 1997). Some of these cell types include (Dickison, 2000):
* sclereids (pears)
* starch grains (potatoes and other tubers)
* [[raphide]] crystals (pineapple)
* [[druse (botany)|druse]] crystals (citrus, beets, spinach)
* silica bodies (cereal grasses and bamboos)
In a case where a young woman had been stabbed to death, witnesses reported that she had eaten her last meal at a particular fast food restaurant. However, her stomach contents did not match the limited menu of the restaurant, leading investigators to conclude that she had eaten at some point after being seen in the restaurant. The investigation led to the apprehension of a man whom the victim knew, and with whom she had shared her actual final meal (Dickison, 2000).
Time since death can be approximated by the state of digestion of the stomach contents. It normally takes at least a couple of hours for food to pass from the stomach to the small intestine; a meal still largely in the stomach implies death shortly after eating, while an empty or nearly-empty stomach suggests a longer time period between eating and death (Batten, 1995). However, there are numerous mitigating factors to take into account: the extent to which the food had been chewed, the amount of fat and protein present, physical activity undertaken by the victim prior to death, mood of the victim, physiological variation from person to person. All these factors affect the rate at which food passes through the digestive tract. Pathologists are generally hesitant to base a precise time of death on the evidence of stomach contents alone.

===Other organisms===
Bacteria, [[maggots]] and other organisms that may have ingested some subject matter may have also ingested any toxic substance within it.

==Detection and classification==
Detection of drugs and pharmaceuticals in biological samples is usually done by an initial screening and then a confirmation of the compound(s), which may include a quantitation of the compound(s). The screening and confirmation are usually, but not necessarily, done with different analytical methods. Every analytical method used in forensic toxicology should be carefully tested by performing a validation of the method to ensure correct and indisputable results at all times. A testing laboratory involved in forensic toxicology should adhere to a quality programme to ensure the best possible results and safety of any individual.

The choice of method for testing is highly dependent on what kind of substance one expects to find and the material on which the testing is performed. Biological samples are more complex to analyze because of factors such as the [[matrix effect]] and the metabolism and conjugation of the target compounds.

===Gas chromatography===
[[Gas-liquid chromatography]] is of particular use in examining volatile [[organic compound]]s.

===Detection of metals===
The compounds suspected of containing a metal are traditionally analyzed by the destruction of the organic matrix by chemical or thermal oxidation. This leaves the metal to be identified and quantified in the inorganic residue, and it can be detected using such methods as the [[Reinsch test]], emission [[spectroscopy]] or [[X-ray diffraction]]. Unfortunately, while this identifies the metals present it removes the original compound, and so hinders efforts to determine what may have been ingested. The [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] of various metallic compounds can vary considerably.

===Nonvolatile organic substances===
Drugs, both prescribed and illicit, [[pesticide]]s, natural products, [[pollutant]]s and industrial compounds are some of the most common nonvolatile compounds encountered. Screening methods include [[thin-layer chromatography]], [[gas-liquid chromatography]] and immunoassay. For complete legal identification, a second confirmatory test is usually also required. The trend today is to use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, preceded with sample workup as liquid-liquid extraction or solid phase extraction. Older methods include:  [[spot test]] (see [[Pill testing]]), typically the [[Marquis reagent|Marquis Reagent]], [[Mecke Reagent]], and [[Froehde's reagent]] for [[opiates]], [[Marquis reagent|Marquis Reagent]] and [[Simon's reagent]] for [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and other analogs, like [[MDMA]], the [[Scott's test]] for cocaine, and the modified [[Duquenois-Levine reagent|Duquenois]] reagent for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and other [[cannabinoids]]. For compounds that don't have a common spot test, like [[benzodiazepines]], another test may be used, typically [[mass spectrometry]], or [[spectrophotometry]].

{{Sex (biology) sidebar|state=collapsed}}
'''Gametogenesis''' is a [[biology|biological]] process by which [[diploid]] or [[haploid]] [[precursor cell]]s undergo [[cell division]] and differentiation to form mature haploid [[gamete]]s. Depending on the [[biological life cycle]] of the [[organism]], gametogenesis occurs by [[meiosis|meiotic]] division of diploid [[gametocyte]]s into various gametes, or by mitosis. For example, [[plants]] produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as [[alternation of generations]].

==In Animals==
[[File:Gray's 7 (ovum maturation).svg|thumb|400px|Scheme showing analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the developmental to make any photo in Gujarati the developments and I am not of the service of the spermatids, following their individual pathways. The oocytes and spermatocytes are both gametocytes. Ova and spermatids are complete gametes. In reality, the first polar body typically dies without dividing.]]
Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called [[gonad]]s ([[testis]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females). [[Male]]s and [[female]]s of a species that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] have different forms of gametogenesis:

* '''[[spermatogenesis]]''' (male)
* '''[[oogenesis]]''' (female)

===Stages===
However, before turning into gametogonia, the embryonic development of gametes is the same in males and females.

====Common path====
Gametogonia are usually seen as the initial stage of gametogenesis. However, gametogonia are themselves successors of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the dorsal [[endoderm]] of the [[yolk sac]] migrate along the hindgut to the [[gonadal ridge]]. They multiply by [[mitosis]], and, once they have reached the gonadal ridge in the late embryonic stage, are referred to as gametogonia.  Once the germ cells have developed into gametogonia, they are no longer the same between males and females.

====Individual path====
From gametogonia, male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis. However, by convention, the following pattern is common for both:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Cell type''' || '''[[ploidy]]/[[chromosomes]] in humans''' || '''DNA copy number/[[chromatids]] in human'''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sources are mixed when using this system of numbering. Some sources use the chromatid number when writing "n" rather than the ploidy number. Hence gametogonium and primary gametocyte would be "4n" rather than "2n" with "4c" for copies.  The system used below has been determined by wikipedia consensus and should not necessarily be used as the definitive source on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; || '''Process''' 
 |- 
 | [[gametogonium]] || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after|| [[gametocytogenesis (disambiguation)|gametocytogenesis]] (mitosis)
 |- 
 | primary gametocyte || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after || [[gametidogenesis]] ([[meiosis]] I)
 |- 
 | secondary gametocyte || haploid (N)/23 || 2C / 46|| gametidogenesis (meiosis II)
 |- 
 | [[gametid]] || haploid (N)/23  || C / 23|| 
 |- 
 | gamete || haploid (N)/23 || C / 23|| 
|}

===In vitro gametogenesis===
In vitro gametogenesis (IVG) is the technique of developing [[in vitro generated gametes]], i.e., "the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish."&lt;ref name="ivg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Glenn |last2=Daley |first2=George Q. |last3=Adashi | first3=Eli Y. |date=January 11, 2017 |title=Disruptive reproductive technologies |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/372/eaag2959.full |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=9 |issue=372 |pages= |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aag2959 |access-date=January 16, 2017 | quote=In vitro gametogenesis (IVG)—the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish. Currently feasible in mice, IVG is poised for future success in humans and promises new possibilities for the fields of reproductive and regenerative medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique is currently feasible in mice and will likely have future success in humans and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref name="ivg"/&gt;

==In gametangia==
Fungi, algae, and primitive plants form specialized haploid structures called [[gametangium|gametangia]], where gametes are produced through mitosis. In some fungi, such as the [[Zygomycota]], the gametangia are single cells, situated on the ends of [[hypha]]e, which act as gametes by fusing into a [[zygote]]. More typically, gametangia are multicellular structures that differentiate into male and female organs:

* '''[[antheridium]]''' (male)
* '''[[archegonium]]''' (female)

==In flowering plants==
In angiosperms, the male gametes (always two) are produced inside the pollen tube (in 70% of the species) or inside the [[pollen|pollen grain]] (in 30% of the species) through the division of a generative cell into two sperm nuclei. Depending on the species, this can occur while the pollen forms in the [[anther]] (pollen tricellular) or after [[pollination]] and growth of the [[pollen tube]] (pollen bicellular in the anther and in the stigma). The female gamete is produced inside the [[embryo sac]] of the [[ovule]].

==Meiosis==

[[Origin and function of meiosis|Meiosis]] is a central feature of gametogenesis, but the adaptive function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate.  A key event during meiosis is the pairing of [[homologous chromosomes]] and [[homologous recombination|recombination]] (exchange of genetic information) between homologous chromosomes.  This process promotes the production of increased genetic diversity among progeny and the recombinational repair of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damage]] in the DNA to be passed on to progeny.  To explain the adaptive function of meiosis (as well as of gametogenesis and the sexual cycle), some authors emphasize diversity,&lt;ref name="pmid20576791"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison CJ, Alvey E, Henderson IR |title=Meiosis in flowering plants and other green organisms |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2863–75 |year=2010 |pmid=20576791 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erq191 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others emphasize [[DNA repair]]. &lt;ref name="pmid27605505"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mirzaghaderi G, Hörandl E |title=The evolution of meiotic sex and its alternatives |journal=Proc.

A '''gravity-based structure''' (GBS) is a support structure held in place by [[gravity]]. A common application for a GBS is an offshore [[oil platform]]. These structures are often constructed in [[fjords]] since their protected area and sufficient depth are very desirable for construction. A GBS intended for use as an offshore oil platform is constructed of steel [[reinforced concrete]], often with tanks or cells which can be used to control the buoyancy of the finished GBS. When completed, a GBS is towed to its intended location and sunk. Prior to deployment, a [[Offshore geotechnical engineering|study of the seabed]] have to be done in order to ensure it can withstand the vertical load exerted on it by that structure.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, E.T.R. (2010). Offshore Geotechnical Engineering - Principles and Practice. Thomas Telford, Reston, VA, U.S.A., 520 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity-based structures are also used for offshore [[wind power]] plants. By the end of 2010, 14 of the world's offshore wind farms were supported by gravity-based structures. The GBS are suited for water depths greater than 20 m. The deepest registered offshore wind farm with gravity-based structures is Thornton Bank 1, Belgium, with a depth up to 27.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorc.dk/Knowledge/Offshore-renewables-map/Offshore-site-datasheet/Thornton-Bank-1-Offshore-Wind-Farm/000030|title=LORC Knowledge. "Datasheet for site: Thornton Bank 1 offshore wind farm", 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As offshore wind power plants are growing in size and moving towards deeper waters, the GBS is considered competitive in comparison with other support structures.

'''''Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique''''' is a famous popular scientific treatise and self-help book published in London in 1926 by Dutch [[gynecology|gynecologist]] [[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]], retired director of the Gynecological Clinic in [[Haarlem]], and "one of the major writers on human sexuality during the early twentieth century" (Frayser &amp; Whitby, p.&amp;nbsp;300).  It was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition.  After World-War Two, it sold over a half-million copies. A revised edition was published in 1965. and a subsequent one in 2000 (Melody &amp; Pearson, p.&amp;nbsp;96).

It proclaimed the "critical goal of marriage consists of sexual pleasure shared by husband and wife" (Melody and Person, p.&amp;nbsp;93). A 2000 edition of the book described itself as concentrating "on the cultivation of the technique of eroticism as an art in marriage."

Frederica Mathewes-Green, in the ''National Review'', described it as

{{quote |the best-selling sex manual of all time. Over half a million copies were sold in the United States alone, and it enjoyed equal success in Europe.  ...This is not a prude's book.  Young couples who grab a used copy off the Internet may have even as much fun with it as their great-grandparents did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = National Review | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/mathewes-green/mathewesgreen200411220815.asp | date = 2004-11-22 | first = Frederica | last = Mathewes-Green}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first printing had an insert: "The sale of this book is strictly limited to members of the medical profession, Psychoanalysts, Scholars, and to such adults as may have a definite position in the field of Physiological, Psychological, or Social Research."  It was placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] in 1931.

'''Important ecological areas''' (IEAs) are [[habitat]] areas which, either by themselves or in a network, contribute significantly to an [[ecosystem]]’s productivity, [[biodiversity]], and resilience. Appropriate management of key ecological features delineates the management boundaries of an IEA. The identification and protection of IEAs is an element of an [[ecosystem-based management]] approach.

Important ecological areas may have varying levels of management of extractive activities, from monitoring up to and including [[marine reserve]].  IEAs have management measures tailored to the ecological features within the area with consideration of socioeconomic factors.  Whereas marine reserves generally have a fixed management policy of no extraction or ‘no-take’.  Nonetheless, a marine reserve may be the appropriate management policy for an IEA.

The identification and management of IEAs is a form of [[ocean zoning]].  In the event that there are a series of linked IEAs within a large marine ecosystem, a collective action to manage the network, such as a [[marine sanctuary]] or [[national monument]], may be warranted.

Examples are [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[forest]]s, etc.

The '''Integrated and Environmental Plant Management Association (IEPMA)''' is mainly an educational association, with an annual conference held in January in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]] as one of its main focuses. The Conference draws participants from throughout [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]]–with speakers from government (municipal, provincial, and federal), universities, colleges, and industry. Participants in these conferences can gain CEC’s (Continuing Education Credits) toward renewal of the BC Pesticide Applicator Certificate.

The IEPMA was originally constituted to represent professional pesticide applicators in British Columbia. Through the years, however, its membership has become more diverse, and now also includes landscape consultants and representatives from commercial nurseries, school districts, golf courses, and various departments of municipal governments.

The forerunner of the IEPMA was the Environmental Standards Association, formed in 1983 in Kelowna. The association was reconstituted in [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia]] in 1992 as the IEPMA, with Dudley Gordon as its first President.

}}'''ICBA''' (International Center for Biosaline Agriculture) is an international, non-profit agricultural research and development center which focuses on the closely linked issues of water, environment, income, and [[food security]]. ICBA conducts research and development programs that aim to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in marginal environments.

Its headquarters are in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and it is a founding member of the [[Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture]] (AIRCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airca.org/index.php/airca-members|title=AIRCA Members|website=www.airca.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menanwc.org/about-network/current-members/international-center-biosaline-agriculture-icba|title=International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA)|website=Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaari.org/about/members/|title=Members : APAARI|website=Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1992, the [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IDB) initiated a series of expert consultations which outlined the objectives and activities of the new institute. In November 1992, the IDB Board of Executive Directors approved financing for start-up operations. Subsequent consultations between the Bank and the General Secretariat of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] led to the selection of the United Arab Emirates as a host country for the new center.

In 1996, the IDB and the Government of the UAE signed an agreement to establish ICBA as a formal entity. In 1997, the Municipality of Dubai donated 100 hectares of land at Al Ruwayyah, where ICBA's head office is now based. The center became operational in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319057675|title=Environmental Cost and Face of Agriculture in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Ahmed|first2=Mushtaque|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-3-319-05768-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA’s founding donors were the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID), the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]] (AFESD), and the [[Politics of the United Arab Emirates|Government of the United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

Currently the Center is funded by the three core donors: the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment of the UAE (formerly the Ministry of Environment and Water); the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi; and the Islamic Development Bank. The Center has additional support from several development agencies and international donors such as&amp;nbsp;the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the UAE Government, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Municipalities, and the private sector in Oman and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470290187.ch16/summary|title=The Role of Biosaline Agriculture in Managing Freshwater Shortages and Improving Water Security|last=Al-Attar|first=Mohammad|date=2003|publisher=Iowa State Press|isbn=9780470290187|editor-last=Scanes|editor-first=Colin G.|pages=271–280|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470290187.ch16|editor-last2=Miranowski|editor-first2=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|last2=Elouafi|first2=Ismahane A.|date=2014|title=The alternative futures of the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture: from salinity research to greening the desert|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|journal=Foresight|volume=16|issue=5|pages=389–409|doi=10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|issn=1463-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and development focus ==
[[file:Ismahane Elouafi (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dr Ismahane Elouafiis the center's director (2015)]]
Initially ICBA focused solely on biosaline environments but its applied research for development now aims to address agricultural challenges in all marginal environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its tasks include assessment of natural resources, [[Adaptation to global warming|climate change adaptation]], [[Agricultural productivity|crop productivity]] and diversification, [[aquaculture]], [[bioenergy]] and policy analysis.

ICBA works on a number of technological developments, including the use of conventional and non-conventional water (such as saline, [[Wastewater|treated wastewater]], [[Industrial water treatment|industrial water]], [[agricultural drainage]], and seawater);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Scientists_finding_ways_to_help_farmers_maximise_ground_water-GN_29032015_300309/|title=Scientists finding ways to help farmers maximise ground water|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Janice|date=29 March 2015|website=Thomson Reuters ZAWYA|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslim-science.com/icba-oasis-desert/|title=ICBA – An Oasis in the Desert|date=2 August 2014|website=Muslim Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; water and land management technologies; and [[remote sensing]] and modeling for climate change adaptation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Center conducts research on a variety of food crops which hold promise of being resilient, salt tolerant and water efficient. For example, ICBA has been conducting widespread research on [[quinoa]], a multi-purpose, high-protein grain crop which is drought and salt tolerant. ICBA initiated research on a number of quinoa germplasm accessions since 2006–07. The selections from these trials are being introduced to farmers in several countries, e.g. in the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raconteur.net/sustainability/more-meat-eaters-means-uk-farmers-can-cash-in|title=UK farming addresses global meat demand|last=Wale|first=Michael|date=29 July 2015|website=Raconteur|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icbawebsiteyn6lbe9b4h.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/GulfTimes_quinoa_19072015.pdf|title=Proper value chain needed for Quinoa|last=Banerjee|first=Thirtho|date=19 July 2015|work=The Gulf Time|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA scientists are also working to increase the salinity tolerance of hardier traditional crops such as [[date palm]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/saltwater-saviors/30923|title=Saltwater Saviours|last=Cadei|first=Emily|date=15 April 2014|website=OZY|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field of research lies with ''[[Salicornia]]'' and other [[halophyte]]s (salt-loving plants) that remove salts from saline soils and water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Salicornia’s'' oil-bearing seeds produce biofuel, cosmetic oil and edible vegetable oil.

The geographic scope of ICBA has grown since its inception. It now focusses its work on water-scarce countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) including Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC) and South and Southwest Asia. It is currently expanding to include countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|title=Turning Adversity into an Advantage for Food Security Through Improving Soil Quality and Providing Production Systems for Marginal Saline Lands: ICBA Perspectives and Approach|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Taha|first2=Faisal K.|last3=Ismail|first3=Shoaib|last4=Dakheel|first4=Abdullah|last5=Abdelfattah|first5=Mahmoud|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400705180|editor-last=Behnassi|editor-first=Mohamed|pages=43–67|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|editor-last2=Shahid|editor-first2=Shabbir A.|editor-last3=D'Silva|editor-first3=Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Local coordinates''' are measurement indices into a ''local [[coordinate system]]'' or a ''local [[coordinate space]]''. A simple example is using house numbers to locate a [[house]] on a [[street]]; the street is a local coordinate system within a larger system composed of city townships, states, countries, etc.

Local systems exist for convenience. Continuing the geographic example, one could use [[latitude and longitude]] for all terrestrial locations, but unless one has a highly precise [[GPS]] device, this is impractical.

In [[computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]], local coordinate spaces are also useful for their ability to model independently transformable aspects of geometrical [[scene graph]]s. When modeling a car, for example, it is desirable to describe the center of each wheel with respect to the car's coordinate system, but then specify the shape of each wheel in separate local spaces centered about these points. This way, the information describing each wheel can be simply duplicated four times, and independent transformations (e.g., steering rotation) can be similarly effected. Bounding volumes of objects may be described more accurately using extents in the local coordinates, (i.e. an [[object oriented bounding box]], contrasted with the simpler [[axis aligned bounding box]]).

The tradeoff for this flexibility is additional computational cost: the rendering system must access the higher-level coordinate system of the car and combine it with the space of each wheel in order to draw everything in its proper place.

Local coordinates also afford digital designers a means around the finite limits of numerical representation. The [[tread marks]] on a tire, for example, can be described using millimetres by allowing the whole tire to occupy the entire range of numeric precision available. The larger aspects of the car, such as its frame, might be described in centimetres, and the terrain that the car travels on could be specified in meters.

In [[differential topology]], local coordinates on a [[manifold]] are defined by means of an [[atlas (topology)|atlas of charts]]. The basic idea behind coordinate charts is that each small patch of a manifold can be endowed with a set of local coordinates. These are collected together into an atlas, and stitched together in such a way that they are self-consistent on the manifold.

'''Magnetoreception''' (also '''magnetoception''') is a [[sense]] which allows an [[organism]] to detect a [[magnetic field]] to perceive direction, altitude or location. This sensory modality is used by a range of animals for orientation and [[animal navigation|navigation]],&lt;ref name="Wiltschko" /&gt; and as a method for animals to develop regional maps. For the purpose of navigation, magnetoreception deals with the detection of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

Magnetoreception is present in [[bacteria]], [[arthropod]]s, [[mollusc]]s and members of all major taxonomic groups of [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="Wiltschko"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 8 - Magnetoreception|author1=Wiltschko, F.R.  |author2=Wiltschko, W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sensing in Nature|volume=739  |editor=Carlos López-Larrea|year=2012|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1704-0|publisher=Springer|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology  |isbn=978-1-4614-1703-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not thought to have a magnetic sense, but there is a [[protein]] (a [[cryptochrome]]) in the eye which could serve this function.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Lauren E.|last2=Gegear|first2=Robert J.|last3=Reppert|first3=Steven M.|title=Human cryptochrome exhibits light-dependent magnetosensitivity|journal=Nature Communications|date=2011|volume=2|issue=Article 356|doi=10.1038/ncomms1364|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v2/n6/full/ncomms1364.html|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.356F|pmid=21694704|pmc=3128388|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms==
An unequivocal demonstration of the use of magnetic fields for orientation within an [[organism]] has been in a class of bacteria known as [[magnetotactic bacteria]].  These bacteria demonstrate a behavioural phenomenon known as [[magnetotaxis]], in which the bacterium orients itself and migrates in the direction along the Earth's magnetic field lines.  The bacteria contain [[magnetosome]]s, which are nanometer-sized particles of magnetite or iron sulfide enclosed within the bacterial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = R. | year = 1975 | title = Magnetotactic Bacteria | url = | journal = Science | volume = 190 | issue = 4212| pages = 377–379 | doi = 10.1126/science.170679 | pmid = 170679 |bibcode = 1975Sci...190..377B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetosomes are surrounded by a membrane composed of phospholipids and fatty acids and contain at least 20 different proteins &lt;ref&gt;The Magneto-Lab. "Biochemistry and molecular biology of magnetosome formation in ''Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense''." Available: http://magnum.mpi-bremen.de/magneto/research/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  They form in chains where the [[magnetic moment]]s of each magnetosome align in parallel, causing each bacterium cell to essentially act as a [[magnetic dipole]], giving the bacteria their permanent-magnet characteristics.

For animals the mechanism for magnetoreception is unknown, but there exist two main hypotheses to explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Wiltschkojcp&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2000, [[cryptochrome]] was proposed as the "magnetic molecule", so to speak, that could harbor magnetically sensitive radical-pairs. Cryptochrome, a [[flavoprotein]] found in the eyes of [[European robin]]s and other animal species, is the only protein known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in animals.&lt;ref name=Hore2016 /&gt;  The function of cryptochrome is diverse across species, however, the photoinduction of radical-pairs occurs by exposure to blue light, which excites an electron in a [[chromophore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=Roswitha|last2=Ahmad|first2=Margaret|last3=Nießner|first3=Christine|last4=Gehring|first4=Dennis|last5=Wiltschko|first5=Wolfgang|date=2016-05-01|title=Light-dependent magnetoreception in birds: the crucial step occurs in the dark|journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface|volume=13|issue=118|doi=10.1098/rsif.2015.1010|issn=1742-5662|pmc=4892254|pmid=27146685|pages=20151010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth's magnetic field is only 0.5 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] and so it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism, other than phase shift, by which such a field could lead to any chemical changes other than those affecting the weak magnetic fields between radical pairs.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C.

The second proposed model for magnetoreception relies on Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, also referred to as  iron (II, III) oxide or [[magnetite]], a natural oxide with strong magnetism. Iron (II, III) oxide remains permanently magnetized when its length is larger than 50&amp;nbsp;nm and becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field if its length is less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cadiou | first1 = Hervé | last2 = McNaughton | first2 = Peter A | year = 2010 | title = Avian magnetite-based magnetoreception: a physiologist's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface | volume = 7 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = S193–205 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2009.0423.focus | pmid = 20106875 | pmc = 2844004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these situations the Earth's magnetic field leads to a transducible signal via a physical effect on this magnetically sensitive oxide.

Another less general type of magnetic sensing mechanism in animals that has been described is electromagnetic induction used by sharks, stingrays and [[chimaera]]s ([[cartilaginous fish]]).  These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{ind}=-\frac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
These organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa. These receptors are located along the mouth and nose of sharks and stingrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blonder|first=Barbara I.|last2=Alevizon|first2=William S.|date=1988|title=Prey Discrimination and Electroreception in the Stingray Dasyatis sabina|journal=Copeia|volume=1988|issue=1|pages=33–36|doi=10.2307/1445919|jstor=1445919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalmijn|first=A.

==In invertebrates and fish==

The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' was proposed to orient to the magnetic field of the Earth using the first described set of magnetosensory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidal-Gadea| first1 = A.G. | last2 = Ward | first2 = K. | last3 = Beron | first3 = C. |last4 = Ghorashian | first4 = N. | last5 = Gokce| first5 = S. |last6 = Russell | first6 = J. | last7 = Truong| first7 = N. | last8 = Parikh | first8 = A. | last9 = Gadea| first9 = G. |last10 = Ben-Yakar| first10 = A. | last11 = Pierce-Shimomura| first11 = J. |year = 2015 | title = Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans. | journal = eLife | doi =  10.7554/eLife.07493 | pmid = 26083711 | volume=4 | pmc=4525075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worms appear to use the magnetic field to orient during vertical soil migrations that change in sign depending on their satiation state (with hungry worms burrowing down, and satiated worms burrowing up). However, recent evidence challenges these findings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Nimpf|first2=Simon|last3=Hochstoeger|first3=Tobias|last4=Nordmann|first4=Gregory C|last5=Papadaki-Anastasopoulou|first5=Artemis|last6=Keays|first6=David A|date=2018-04-13|title=Comment on "Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans"|url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/30187|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=7|doi=10.7554/elife.30187|issn=2050-084X|pmc=5898909|pmid=29651983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Nordmann|first2=Gregory|last3=Nimpf|first3=Simon|last4=Hochstoeger|first4=Tobias|last5=Kagerbauer|first5=Daniel|last6=Keays|first6=David|date=2018-06-18|title=Revised testing procedures do not elicit magnetoreceptive behavior in C. elegans|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/18/349944|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=349944|doi=10.1101/349944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mollusk ''[[Tochuina tetraquetra]]'' (formerly ''Tritonia diomedea'' or ''Tritonia gigantea'') has been studied for clues as to the neural mechanism behind magnetoreception in a species. Some of the earliest work with ''Tochuina'' showed that prior to a full moon ''Tochuina'' would orient their bodies between magnetic north and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lohmann | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Willows | first2 = A. O. D. | year = 1987 | title = Lunar-Modulated Geomagnetic Orientation by a Marine Mollusk | url = | journal = Science | volume = 235 | issue = 4786| pages = 331–334 | doi = 10.1126/science.3798115 | pmid = 3798115 |bibcode = 1987Sci...235..331L }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Y-maze was established with a right turn equal to geomagnetic south and a left turn equal to geomagnetic east. Within this geomagnetic field 80% of ''Tochuina'' made a turn to the left or magnetic east. However, when a reversed magnetic field was applied that rotated magnetic north 180° there was no significant preference for either turn, which now corresponded with magnetic north and magnetic west. These results, though interesting, do not conclusively establish that ''Tochuina'' uses magnetic fields in magnetoreception. These experiments do not include a control for the activation of the Rubens’ coil in the reversed magnetic field experiments. Therefore, it is possible that heat or noise generated by the coil was responsible for the loss of choice preference.  Further work with ''Tochuina'' was unable to identify any neurons that showed rapid changes in firing as a result of magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lohmann | first1 = K.

Further studies showed that pedal 7 neurons in the pedal ganglion were inhibited when exposed to magnetic fields over the course of 30 minutes. The function of both pedal 5 neurons and pedal 7 neurons is currently unknown.

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|Fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'' needs cryptochrome to respond to magnetic fields.]]

''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is another invertebrate which may be able to orient to magnetic fields. Experimental techniques such as gene knockouts have allowed a closer examination of possible magnetoreception in these fruit flies. Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="Gegear2008" /&gt; In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a missense mutation or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&amp;nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&amp;nbsp;nm – 400&amp;nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

Alteration of the tryptophan protein does not result in the loss of magnetosensitivity of a fly expressing either type 1 Cry or the cryptochrome found in vertebrates, type 2 Cry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gegear | first1 = R.

These experiments used a 5 gauss magnetic field, 10 times the strength of the [[Earth's magnetic field]]). ''Drosophila'' has not been shown to be able to respond to the Earth’s weaker magnetic field.

Studies of magnetoreception in vertebrate fish have been conducted mainly with salmon. For instance, the presence of an internal magnetic compass has been discovered in [[Sockeye salmon|Sockeye Salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus nerka'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Thomas P.|date=1980|title=Evidence for celestial and magnetic compass orientation in lake migrating sockeye salmon fry|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00657119|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology ? A|volume=137|issue=3|pages=243–248|doi=10.1007/bf00657119|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers made this discovery by first placing the young of this species in a symmetrical, circular tank and allowing them to pass through exits in the tank freely. A mean vector was then calculated to represent the directional preferences of these salmon in the natural magnetic field. Notably, when the magnetic field was experimentally rotated, the directional preferences of the young Sockeye Salmon changed accordingly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, researchers concluded that the orientation of swimming behaviour in Sockeye Salmon is influenced by magnetic field information.

Further research regarding magnetoreception in salmon has investigated [[Chinook salmon|Chinook Salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tschawytscha).'' To induce a preference for magnetic East-West, a group of these salmon were housed in a rectangular tank with water flowing from west to east for eighteen months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=P. B.|date=1986-05|title=Experimental evidence for geomagnetic orientation in juvenile salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha Walbaum|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05196.x|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=607–623|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05196.x|issn=0022-1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was also fed exclusively at the west end of the tank during this period. Upon placing these same salmon in a circular tank with symmetrical water flow, a preference for aligning their bodies with magnetic East-West was observed as expected. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90°, the salmon changed their preferred orientation to the North-South axis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From these results, researchers concluded that Chinook Salmon have the capacity to use magnetic field information in directional orientation.

Magnetoreception is well documented in [[honey bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s.&lt;ref name="PB"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pereira-Bomfim, M.D.G.C., Antonialli-Junior, W.F. and Acosta-Avalos, D.|year=2015|title=Effect of magnetic field on the foraging rhythm and behavior of the swarm-founding paper wasp Polybia paulista Ihering (hymenoptera: vespidae)|journal=Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=99–104|doi=10.13102/sociobiology.v62i1.99-104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ants and bees, this is used to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and within their migratory paths.&lt;ref name="Wajnberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author="Wajnberg, E., Acosta-Avalos, D., Alves, O.C., de Oliveira, J.F., Srygley, R.B. and Esquivel, D.M.|year=2010|title=Magnetoreception in eusocial insects: an update|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=7|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S207–S225|doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0526.focus|pmid=20106876|pmc=2843992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, through the use of magnetoreception, the Brazilian stingless bee ''[[Schwarziana quadripunctata]]'' is able to distinguish differences in altitude, location, and directionality using the thousands of hair-like particles on its antennae.&lt;ref name=nunes09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=T.M.|last2=Turatti|first2=I.C.C.|last3=Mateus|first3=S.|last4=Nascimento|first4=F.S.|last5=Lopes|first5=N.P.|last6=Zucchi|first6=R.|year=2009|title=Cuticular Hydrocarbons in the Stingless Bee Schwarziana quadripunctata (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini): Differences between Colonies, Castes and Age |journal=Genetics and Molecular Research |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=589–595 |url=http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2009/vol8-2/pdf/kerr012.pdf |doi=10.4238/vol8-2kerr012 |pmid=19551647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetoreception has also been reported in the [[European eel]] by at least one study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/13/523450769/eels-may-use-magnetic-maps-as-they-slither-across-the-ocean Eels May Use 'Magnetic Maps' As They Slither Across The Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In amphibians and reptiles ==
A number of [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and [[Reptile|reptiles]] including [[Salamander|salamanders]], [[Toad|toads]] and [[Turtle|turtles]] exhibit alignment behaviours with respect to the Earth's magnetic field.

Some of the earliest studies of amphibian magnetoreception were conducted with [[Cave salamander|cave salamanders]] (''Eurycea lucifuga)''. Researchers housed groups of cave salamanders in corridors aligned with either magnetic North-South, or magnetic East-West. In ensuing tests, the magnetic field was experimentally rotated by 90°, and salamanders were placed in cross-shaped structures (one corridor along the new North-South axis, one along the new East-West axis).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John B.|date=1977|title=Use of the earth's magnetic field by orienting cave salamanders (Eurycea lucifuga)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00609616|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology ? A|volume=121|issue=2|pages=273–288|doi=10.1007/bf00609616|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these salamanders showed a significant preference for test corridors which matched the magnetic alignment of their housing corridors, researchers concluded that cave salamanders have the capacity to detect the Earth’s magnetic field, and have a preference for movement along learned magnetic axes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Subsequent research has examined magnetoreception in a more natural setting. Under typical circumstances, [[Eastern newt|red-spotted newts]] (''Notophthalmus viridescens)'' respond to drastic increases in water temperature (which tend to indicate environmental deterioration) by orienting themselves toward the shoreline and heading for land.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John B.|date=1986|title=Magnetic compass orientation in the Eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00614524|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=158|issue=1|pages=103–109|doi=10.1007/bf00614524|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when magnetic fields are experimentally altered, this behaviour is disrupted, and assumed orientations fail to direct the newts to the shoreline.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Moreover, the change in orientation corresponds to the degree by which the magnetic field is shifted.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In other words, inversion of the magnetic poles (a 180° shift) results in inversion of the typical orientation (a 180° shift). Further research has shown that magnetic information is not only used by red-spotted newts for orientation toward the shoreline, but also in orientation toward their home pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|date=1986-08-15|title=Two magnetoreception pathways in a migratory salamander|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.3738508|journal=Science|volume=233|issue=4765|pages=765–767|doi=10.1126/science.3738508|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it seems as though red-spotted newts rely on information regarding the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation within their environment, in particular when orienting toward the shoreline or toward home.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In similar fashion, [[Common toad|European]] (''Bufo bufo'') and [[Natterjack toad|Natterjack]] (''Epidalea calamita)'' toads appear to rely, at least somewhat, on magnetic information for certain orienting behaviours. These species of anurans are known to rely on vision and olfaction when locating and migrating to breeding sites, but it seems magnetic fields may also play a role. When randomly displaced from their breeding sites, these toads remain well-oriented, and are capable of navigating their way back, even when displaced by more than 150 meters.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1987|title=Orientation behaviour of toads (Bufo bufo) displaced from the breeding site|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00605013|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=161|issue=5|pages=715–727|doi=10.1007/bf00605013|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when this displacement is accompanied by the experimental attachment of small magnetic bars, toads fail to relocate breeding sites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1992-01|title=Sex-biassed site fidelity and orientation behaviour in reproductive natterjack toads (Bufo calamita)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927014.1992.9525347|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=4|issue=1|pages=15–32|doi=10.1080/08927014.1992.9525347|issn=0394-9370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering experimental attachment of non-magnetized bars of equal size and weight does not affect relocation, it seems that magnetism is responsible for the observed disorientation of these toads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, researchers have concluded that orientation toward breeding sites in these anurans is influenced by magnetic field information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1987|title=Orientation behaviour of toads (Bufo bufo) displaced from the breeding site|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00605013|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=161|issue=5|pages=715–727|doi=10.1007/bf00605013|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of study on magnetoreception in reptiles involves turtles. Some of the earliest support for magnetoreception in turtles was found in ''Terrapene carolina'', a species of [[box turtle]]. After successfully teaching a group of these box turtles to swim to either the east or west end of an experimental tank, the introduction of a strong magnet into the tank was enough to disrupt the learned routes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathis|first=Alicia|last2=Moore|first2=Frank R.|date=2010-04-26|title=Geomagnetism and the Homeward Orientation of the Box Turtle, Terrapene Carolina|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1988.tb00238.x|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=78|issue=4|pages=265–274|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1988.tb00238.x|issn=0179-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the learning of oriented paths seems to rely on some internal magnetic compass possessed by box turtles. Subsequent discovery of [[magnetite]] in the dura mater of Sea Turtle hatchlings supported this conclusion, as magnetite provides a means by which magnetic fields may be perceived.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/958527742|title=Magnetite Biomineralization and Magnetoreception in Organisms : a New Biomagnetism.|last=G.|first=Stehli, F.|date=1996|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461303138|oclc=958527742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, orientation toward the sea, a behaviour commonly seen in hatchlings of a number of turtle species, may rely, in part, on magnetoreception.  In [[Loggerhead sea turtle|Loggerhead]] and [[Leatherback sea turtle|Leatherback]] turtles, breeding takes place on beaches, and, after hatching, offspring crawl rapidly to the sea. Although differences in light density seem to drive this behaviour, magnetic alignment may also play a part. For instance, the natural directional preferences held by these hatchlings (which lead them from beaches to the sea) reverse upon experimental inversion of the magnetic poles, suggesting the Earth’s magnetic field serves as a reference for proper orientation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrill|first=Maria W.|last2=Salmon|first2=Michael|date=2010-09-30|title=Magnetic orientation by hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from the Gulf of Mexico|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1545-y|journal=Marine Biology|volume=158|issue=1|pages=101–112|doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1545-y|issn=0025-3162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In homing pigeons==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] pigeons can use magnetic fields as part of their complex [[Animal navigation|navigation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions | url = | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1| pages = 21–7 | pmid = 9317262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tinsley Keeton|William Keeton]] showed that time-shifted homing pigeons are unable to orient themselves correctly on a clear, sunny day which is attributed to time-shifted pigeons being unable to compensate accurately for the movement of the sun during the day. Conversely, time-shifted pigeons released on overcast days navigate correctly. This led to the hypothesis that under particular conditions, homing pigeons rely on magnetic fields to orient themselves. Further experiments with magnets attached to the backs of homing pigeons demonstrated that disruption of the bird's ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field leads to a loss of proper orientation behavior under overcast conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W.

In a choice test birds were trained to jump onto a platform on one end of a tunnel if there was no magnetic field present and to jump onto a platform on the other end of the tunnel if a magnetic field was present. In this test, birds were rewarded with a food prize and punished with a time penalty. Homing pigeons were able to make the correct choice 55%-65% of the time which is higher than what would be expected if the pigeons were simply guessing. 

For a long time the [[Trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] system was the suggested location for a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor in the pigeon. This was based on two findings: First, magnetite-containing cells were reported in specific locations in the upper beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleissner|first=Gerta|last2=Holtkamp-Rötzler|first2=Elke|last3=Hanzlik|first3=Marianne|last4=Winklhofer|first4=Michael|last5=Fleissner|first5=Günther|last6=Petersen|first6=Nikolai|last7=Wiltschko|first7=Wolfgang|date=2003-02-26|title=Ultrastructural analysis of a putative magnetoreceptor in the beak of homing pigeons|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology|language=en|volume=458|issue=4|pages=350–360|doi=10.1002/cne.10579|pmid=12619070|issn=0021-9967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies, however, revealed that these cells were macrophages, not magnetosensitive neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treiber|first=Christoph Daniel|last2=Salzer|first2=Marion Claudia|last3=Riegler|first3=Johannes|last4=Edelman|first4=Nathaniel|last5=Sugar|first5=Cristina|last6=Breuss|first6=Martin|last7=Pichler|first7=Paul|last8=Cadiou|first8=Herve|last9=Saunders|first9=Martin|date=2012-04-11|title=Clusters of iron-rich cells in the upper beak of pigeons are macrophages not magnetosensitive neurons|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature11046|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=484|issue=7394|pages=367–70|doi=10.1038/nature11046|pmid=22495303|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Svenja|last2=Treiber|first2=Christoph Daniel|last3=Salzer|first3=Marion Claudia|last4=Michalik|first4=Andreas|last5=Ushakova|first5=Lyubov|last6=Keays|first6=David Anthony|last7=Mouritsen|first7=Henrik|last8=Heyers|first8=Dominik|date=2018-08-01|title=Lidocaine is a nocebo treatment for trigeminally mediated magnetic orientation in birds|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/145/20180124|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=15|issue=145|pages=20180124|doi=10.1098/rsif.2018.0124|issn=1742-5689|pmc=6127160|pmid=30089685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, pigeon magnetic field detection is impaired by sectioning the trigeminal nerve and by application of [[lidocaine]], an anesthetic, to the olfactory mucosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=Roswitha|last2=Schiffner|first2=Ingo|last3=Fuhrmann|first3=Patrick|last4=Wiltschko|first4=Wolfgang|date=September 2010|title=The Role of the Magnetite-Based Receptors in the Beak in Pigeon Homing|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982210008626|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=17|pages=1534–1538|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.073|pmid=20691593|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lidocaine treatment might lead to unspecific effects and not represent a direct interference with potential magnetoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Svenja|last2=Treiber|first2=Christoph Daniel|last3=Salzer|first3=Marion Claudia|last4=Michalik|first4=Andreas|last5=Ushakova|first5=Lyubov|last6=Keays|first6=David Anthony|last7=Mouritsen|first7=Henrik|last8=Heyers|first8=Dominik|date=2018-08-01|title=Lidocaine is a nocebo treatment for trigeminally mediated magnetic orientation in birds|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/145/20180124|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=15|issue=145|pages=20180124|doi=10.1098/rsif.2018.0124|issn=1742-5689|pmc=6127160|pmid=30089685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, an involvment of the trigeminal system is still debated.

Taken together the receptor responsible for magnetosensitivity in homing pigeons remains uncertain.

Aside from the sensory receptor for magnetic reception in homing pigeons there has been work on neural regions that are possibly involved in the processing of magnetic information within the brain. Areas of the brain that have shown increases in activity in response to magnetic fields with a strength of 50 or 150 microtesla are the posterior [[vestibular nuclei]], [[dorsal thalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[Avian pallium|visual hyperpallium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = L.-Q. | last2 = Dickman | first2 = J.

==In mammals==

[[File:Flickr - Furryscaly - Smile for the Camera.jpg|thumb|Several mammals, including the [[big brown bat]] (''Eptesicus fuscus'') can use magnetic fields for orientation.]]

Work with [[mouse|mice]], [[mole-rat (disambiguation)|mole-rat]]s and [[bat]]s has shown that some mammals are capable of magnetoreception. When [[wood mouse|woodmice]] are removed from their home area and deprived of visual and olfactory cues, they orient themselves towards their homes until an inverted magnetic field is applied to their cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mather | first1 = J.G. | last2 = Baker | first2 = R. R. | year = 1981 | title = Magnetic sense of direction in woodmice for route-based navigation | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 291 | issue = 5811| pages = 152–155 | doi = 10.1038/291152a0 |bibcode = 1981Natur.291..152M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the same mice are allowed access to visual cues, they are able to orient themselves towards home despite the presence of inverted magnetic fields. This indicates that when woodmice are displaced, they use magnetic fields to orient themselves if there are no other cues available. However, early studies of these subjects were criticized because of the difficulty of completely removing sensory cues, and in some because the tests were performed out of the natural environment. In others, the results of these experiments do not conclusively show a response to magnetic fields when deprived of other cues, because the magnetic field was artificially changed before the test rather than during it.&lt;ref name="Marhold Wiltschko Burda"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A magnetic polarity compass for direction finding in a subterranean mammal |last1=Marhold|first1=S. |last2=Wiltschko|first2=W. |last3=Burda|first3=H. |year=1997 |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=421–423 |doi=10.1007/s001140050422 |bibcode=1997NW.....84..421M |pp=&lt;!--This source is for both of the previous sentences.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research, accounting for those factors, has led to a conclusion that the [[Zambian mole-rat]], a subterranean mammal, uses magnetic fields as a polarity compass to aid in the orientation of their nests.&lt;ref name="Marhold Wiltschko Burda" /&gt; In contrast to work with woodmice, Zambian mole-rats do not exhibit different orientation behavior when a visual cue such as the sun is present, a result that has been suggested is due to their subterranean lifestyle. Further investigation of mole-rat magnetoreception lead to the finding that exposure to magnetic fields leads to an increase in neural activity within the [[superior colliculus]] as measured by immediate early gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nemec | first1 = P. | last2 = Altmann | first2 = J. | last3 = Marhold | first3 = S. | last4 = Burda | first4 = H. | last5 = Oelschlager | first5 = H.

However, within the inner sublayer of the intermediate gray layer (InGi) there were two or three clusters of responsive cells. The more time the mole rats were exposed to a magnetic field the greater the immediate early gene expression within the InGi. However, if Zambian mole-rats were placed in a field with a shielded magnetic field only a few scattered cells were active. Therefore, it has been proposed that in mammals, the superior colliculus is an important neural structure in the processing of magnetic information.

Bats may also use magnetic fields to orient themselves. While it is known that bats use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to navigate over short distances, it is unclear how they navigate over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Thorup | first2 = K. | last3 = Vonhof | first3 = M.J. | last4 = Cochran | first4 = W.W. | last5 = Wikelski | first5 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Bat orientation using Earth's magnetic field | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7120| page = 702 | doi = 10.1038/444702a | pmid = 17151656 |bibcode = 2006Natur.444..702H }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Eptesicus fuscus]]'' are taken from their home roosts and exposed to magnetic fields 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise of magnetic north, they are disoriented and set off for their homes in the wrong direction. Therefore, it seems that ''Eptesicus fuscus'' is capable of magnetoreception. However, the exact use of magnetic fields by ''Eptesicus fuscus'' is unclear as the magnetic field could be used either as a map, a compass, or a compass calibrator. Recent research with another bat species, ''[[Myotis myotis]]'', supports the hypothesis that bats use magnetic fields as a compass calibrator and their primary compass is the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = W. | year = 2006 | title = Magnetoreception | url = | journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 157–68 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20363 | pmid = 16435299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes'') may use magnetoreception when predating small rodents. When foxes perform their high-jumps onto small prey like mice and voles, they tend to jump in a north-eastern compass direction. In addition, successful attacks are "tightly clustered" to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox 'rangefinder' sense expands the magnetic menagerie |url= http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/01/fox_rangefinder_sense_expands.html |website=blogs.nature.com |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] / Macmillan |accessdate=6 June 2014 |pp=&lt;!--This is an official blog of the journal ''Nature'', and subject to editorial control. It is not a self-published source.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study has found that when domestic dogs are off the leash and the Earth's magnetic field is calm, they prefer to urinate and defecate with their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=Vlastimil|first2=Petra |last2=Nováková |first3=Erich Pascal |last3=Malkemper |first4=Sabine |last4=Begall |first5=Vladimír |last5=Hanzal |first6=Miloš |last6=Ježek |first7=Tomáš |last7=Kušta |first8=Veronika |last8=Němcová |first9=Jana |last9=Adámková |first10=Kateřina |last10=Benediktová |first11=Jaroslav |last11=Červený |first12=Hynek|last12= Burda|title=Dogs are sensitive to small variations of the Earth's magnetic field|journal=Frontiers in Zoology|year=2013|url=http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/10/1/80/abstract|accessdate=February 25, 2014|doi=10.1186/1742-9994-10-80 |volume=10 |issue=1|pages=80 |pmid=24370002 |pmc=3882779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence for magnetoreception in large mammals.  Resting and grazing cattle as well as [[roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus'') and [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'') tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic north-south direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Begall | first1 = S. | last2 = Cerveny | first2 = J. | last3 = Neef | first3 = J. | last4 = Vojtech | first4 = O. | last5 = Burda | first5 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Magnetic alignment in grazing and resting cattle and deer | url = | journal = Proc.

However, because of the descriptive nature of this study, alternative explanations (e.g., the sun compass) could not be excluded.  In a follow-up study, researchers analyzed body orientations of ruminants in localities where the geomagnetic field is disturbed by high-voltage power lines to determine how local variation in magnetic fields may affect orientation behaviour.  This was done by using satellite and aerial images of herds of cattle and field observations of grazing roe deer.  Body orientation of both species was random on pastures under or near power lines.  Moreover, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.  The disturbing effect of the power lines on body alignment diminished with the distance from the conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burda | first1 = H. | last2 = Begalla | first2 = S. | last3 = Červený | first3 = J. | last4 = Neefa | first4 = J. | last5 = Němecd | first5 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields disrupt magnetic alignment of ruminants | url = | journal = Proc.

Humans "are not believed to have a magnetic sense", but humans do have a cryptochrome (a flavoprotein, CRY2) in the retina which has a light-dependent magnetosensitivity. CRY2 "has the molecular capability to function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor", so the area was thought (2011) to be ripe for further study.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

==Issues==
The largest issue affecting verification of an animal magnetic sense is that despite more than 50 years of work on magnetoreception there has yet to be an identification of a sensory receptor.&lt;ref name="Gould, J. L. 1984"/&gt;  Given that the entire receptor system could likely fit in a one-millimeter cube and have a magnetic content of less than one ppm, it is difficult to discern the parts of the brain where this information is processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirschvink|first=J.L.|title=Magnetoreception: homing in on vertebrates|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=390|issue=6658|doi=10.1038/36986|bibcode = 1997Natur.390..339K|pages=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In various organisms a cryptochrome mediated receptor has been implicated in magnetoreception. At the same time a magnetite-based system has been suggested to be relevant to magnetosensation in birds. The third proposed mechanism (electromagnetic induction) has still not been tested in non-aquatic animals. Furthermore, it is possible that two complementary mechanisms play a role in magnetic field detection in animals. This dual mechanism theory in birds raises the questions: If such a mechanism is actually responsible for magnetoreception, to what degree is each method responsible for stimulus transduction, and how do they lead to a transducible signal given a magnetic field with the Earth’s strength?&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt;

The precise use of magnetoreception in animal navigation is unclear. Some animals appear to use their magnetic sense as a map, compass, or compass calibrator. The compass method allows animals not only to find north, but also to maintain a constant heading in a particular direction. Although the ability to sense direction is important in migratory navigation, many animals also have the ability to sense small fluctuations in earth’s magnetic field to compute coordinate maps with a resolution of a few kilometers or better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=J.L.|title=Animal navigation: the evolution of magnetic orientation|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=11|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.03.052|pmid=18522823|pages=R482–R484}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, birds such as the homing pigeon are believed to use the magnetite in their beaks to detect magnetic signposts and thus, the magnetic sense they gain from this pathway is a possible map.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt; Yet, it has also been suggested that homing pigeons and other birds use the visually mediated cryptochrome receptor as a compass.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt;

The purpose of magnetoreception in birds and other animals may be varied, but has proved difficult to study. Numerous studies use magnetic fields larger than the Earth’s field. Studies such as of ''Tritonia'' have used electrophysiological recordings from only one or two neurons, and many others have been solely correlative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=Need once cite for each of the three, or a single cite, e.g. to a literature review, that covers all three.}}

[[Image:Mat.svg|right|thumb|The structure of a matrice of concepts]]
The '''matrices of concepts''' are a conceptual tool put forth by philosopher Paul Franceschi, that aim at providing an alternative to the [[semiotic square]] described by [[Algirdas Greimas]]. To the difference of the semiotic square, a matrix of concepts is made up of 6 concepts, from which two are neutral, two are positive and two are negative. The relationships between the 6 concepts of the same matrix can be stated as follows:
* A0 and Ā0 are dual or inverse; A+ and Ā- are contraries; A- and Ā+ are contraries
* A+ and Ā+ are complementary, in the same way as A- and Ā- 
* A+ and A- are corollary, in the same way as  Ā+ and Ā-
* A0 and A+ are related, in the same way as A0 and A-, Ā0 and Ā+, Ā0 and Ā-

The applications of the matrices of concepts relate to [[paradigmatic analysis]], but also to the [[dialectical plan]], and more generally to the [[study of concepts]].

'''McDaniel College Budapest''' is the European Campus of [[McDaniel College]], an accredited, private selective College of the [[Liberal Arts]] and Sciences, located in [[Westminster, Maryland]], United States.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/education/bal-hl-mcdaniel-story.html Baltimore Sun School Profile: McDaniel]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a standard American four-year undergraduate program in [[Hungary]], leading to an American Bachelor of Arts degree. Students have the option to complete the upper two years of study at the main campus of the college in the United States. In addition, students enrolled in Budapest earn credits that are fully transferable to any other American college or university.&lt;ref name="american degree"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/the-college/american-degree/ McDaniel College Budapest/The College/American Degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Campus of McDaniel College in [[Budapest]] is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the accrediting agency for McDaniel College. McDaniel College Budapest is registered in Hungary as a foreign institution of higher education by the permission of the Hungarian Minister of Education.

== History ==
The Budapest campus of McDaniel College was established in 1993 and the first academic year started in September 1994. Originally it was placed in a modern educational centre on the Buda side and moved to its recent location in 2001, a restored late 19th century school building.&lt;ref name="history budapest"&gt;[http://www.mcdaniel.edu/information/about/partners/mcdaniel-europe McDaniel College/Information/About/History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its founding, more than 300 students who began their studies in Budapest have graduated from McDaniel College. In addition, several hundred students from McDaniel College in Westminster as well as other colleges have studied abroad there. 

In 2017 the campus was at the center of a political controversy in Hungary that could have led to its closure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-mcdaniel-hungary-20170629-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis was eventually resolved and the satellite campus was left open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-maryland-hungry-agreement-20170714-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDaniel College Building.jpg|(default)px|thumbnail|left|The building of the McDaniel College Budapest.]]

== The Budapest Campus ==
The [[Budapest]] campus is located in a restored school building adjacent to the Veterinary College of [[Szent István University]]. Facilities include a computer lab, classrooms, a board room, gymnasium and cafeteria. The average class size is eight students.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"&gt;[http://www.mcdaniel.hu McDaniel College Budapest]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDaniel Graduation.jpg|thumb|right|McDaniel Graduation]]

== Majors ==
McDaniel College Budapest offers a number of major programs, from art history, business, and communication, to political science and psychology. Students can enter the program as undecided, sample a number of different courses, and then choose their major. In addition, if students decide they would like to pursue a major different than the one they started, they are free to change majors—all of the credits earned remain on a student’s record, and no time is lost for graduation. Some of the majors can be pursued in combined dual major programs—art-communication, business-economics—that combine features of more than one major program in order to give students more options after graduation.&lt;ref name="majors"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/majors/overview/ McDaniel College Budapest/Majors]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study Abroad ==

The Budapest Campus also serves as a study abroad centre. Students from the home campus – usually accompanied by a professor teaching his/her courses – have been arriving for a semester abroad in Budapest since 1998. The study abroad semester includes a weekend study tour in Hungary and a 5-day tour to Vienna and Venice.The Study Abroad program is open for any undergraduate, especially ones studying at US or Canadian undergraduate programs.

== Students ==

Students from more than twenty countries study at the College.&lt;ref name="student body"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/student-life/student-body-2/ McDaniel College Budapest/Student Life/Student Body]&lt;/ref&gt; Classes are conducted in English. Campus has a student newspaper, Messenger.&lt;ref&gt;https://mcdanielmessengeronline.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alumni ==
Hungarian alumni include executive Sandor Zwack, president and CEO of the Zwack Beverage Company, filmmaker Dávid Jancsó, and singer Tamás Palcsó.{{fact|date=April 2015}}

[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of [[mind/body dualism]]. Descartes believed inputs were passed on by the sensory organs to the [[Pineal gland|epiphysis]] in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S. Turner |page=78 |quote=...a rejection of any dualism between mind and body, and a consequent insistence on the argument that the body is never simply a physical object but always an embodiment of consciousness. |isbn=1412929873 |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYKjzsc6SkAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing's being immaterial...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Elizabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how causation of bodies works. Causal relations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms, not all of which are of the push–pull variety.&lt;ref name="sep-mental-causation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=David |last=Robb |first2=John |last2=Heil |editor=Edward N.

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:
"...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells..."&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book |pages= 9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 |author=Eric R.

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state.

Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions===
{{main|Dualistic cosmology|Gnosticism}}
In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:
{{quote|My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Treatise of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Treatise of Man''}}{{quote|[The] mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland's being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them through the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst1&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Passions of the Soul''}}

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.
{{quote|...whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix,...The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to... organize this 'manifold of raw intuition'.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]] |title=Kant's View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

Kant views the mind–body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric Watkins |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIIsaGoHshoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108 |chapter=Causality in context |title=Kant and the Metaphysics of Causality |isbn=0521543614 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].
{{quote|On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play no causal role. Huxley, who held the view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to the work of a locomotive.&lt;ref name=Robinson2&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, William, |title=Epiphenomenalism |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead.

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.
{{quote|The body–mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously [namely]: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that ''act'' upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 ''acts'' upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of body–mind interaction.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|Karl Popper|''Notes of a realist on the body–mind problem''}}

===Searle===
{{Main|John Searle}}
For [[John Rogers Searle|Searle]] (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a [[false dichotomy]]; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain.  
{{quote|According to Searle then, there is no more a mind–body problem than there is a macro–micro economics problem. They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena. [...] But Searle is careful to maintain that the mental – the domain of qualitative experience and understanding – is autonomous and has no counterpart on the microlevel; any redescription of these macroscopic features amounts to a kind of evisceration, ...&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;

They have the potential for [[superplastic deformation]].&lt;ref name="Averback 1992" /&gt; Because of the small grain size and added grain boundaries properties such as ductility, hardness, and reactivity see drastic changes from ceramics with larger grains.

==Structure of Nanophase Ceramics==
The structure of nanophase ceramics is not too different than that of [[ceramic]]s.  The main difference is the amount of surface area per mass.  Particles of [[ceramic]]s have small surface areas, but when those particles are shrunk to within a few nanometers, the surface area of the same amount of a mass of a [[ceramic]] greatly increases.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale"&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special "What's So Special about the Nanoscale?"]. nano.gov. Retrieved December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  So in general, nanophase materials have greater surface areas than that of a similar mass material at a larger scale.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is important because if the surface area is very large the particles can be in contact with more of their surroundings, which in turn increases the reactivity of the material.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  The reactivity of a material changes the material's [[mechanical properties]] and [[chemical properties]], among many other things.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is especially true in nanophase ceramics.

==Properties of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties than regular [[ceramic]]s due to their improved reactivity.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  Nanophase ceramics exhibit different mechanical properties than their counterpart such as higher [[hardness]], higher [[fracture toughness]], and high [[ductility]].&lt;ref name="Szlufarska"&gt;Szlufarska, Izabela, Nakano, Aiichiro, Vashista, Priya.(August 5, 2005). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5736/911.full "A Crossover in the Mechanical Response of Nanocrystalline Ceramics"] sciencemag.com. Volume 309 pgs. 911-913. Accessed December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These properties are far from [[ceramic]]s which behave as brittle, low ductile materials.

===Titanium Dioxide===
[[File:Strain Rate Sensitivity-page0001.jpg|thumb|Strain rate sensitivity for {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]][[File:Microhardness of titaniumdioxide-page0001.jpg|thumb|Microhardness of {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]
[[Titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|TiO|2}}), has been shown to have increased hardness and ductility at the nanoscale.  In an experiment, grains of [[titanium dioxide]] that had an average size of 12 nanometers were compressed at 1.4 GPa and [[sintered]] at 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;Siegel, R.W.. [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ms.21.080191.003015 "Cluster-Assembled Nanophase Materials"]. ''Annual Review of Materials Science'' (1991) Volume 21, pgs. 559-577.&lt;/ref&gt;   The result was a grain hardness of about 2.2 times greater than that of grains of [[titanium dioxide]] with an average size of 1.3 micrometers at the same temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  In the same experiment, the [[ductility]] of [[titanium dioxide]] was measured.  The [[strain rate]] sensitivity of a 250 nanometer grain of [[titanium dioxide]] was about 0.0175, while a grain with size of about 20 nanometers had a [[strain rate]] sensitivity of approximately .037; a significant increase.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Processing of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics can be processed from atomic, molecular, or bulk precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Gas condensation, [[chemical precipitation]], aerosol reactions, biological templating, [[chemical vapor deposition]], and [[physical vapor deposition]] are techniques used to synthesis nanophase ceramics from molecular or atomic precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;Siegel, Richard W.. [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/79912 "SYNTHESIS, PROPERTIES, AND APPLICATIONS OF NANOPHASE MATERIALS"]. April 1995. Accessed December 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To process nanophase ceramics from bulk precursors, mechanical attrition, [[crystallization]] from the [[amorphous state]], and phase separation are used to create nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Synthesizing nanophase ceramics from atomic or molecular precursors are desired more because a greater control over microscopic aspects of the nanophase ceramic can occur.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;

===Gas Condensation===
[[File:Gas condensation-page0001.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of nanophase ceramics using gas condensation.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]Gas condensation is one way nanophase ceramics are produced.  First, precursor ceramics are evaporated from sources within a gas-condensation chamber.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Then the ceramics are condensed in a gas (dependent on the material being synthesized) and transported via [[convection]] to a liquid-nitrogen filled cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Next, the ceramic powders are scraped off the cold finger and collect in a funnel below the cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  The ceramic powders then become consolidated in a low-pressure compaction device and then in a high-pressure compaction device.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  This all occurs in a vacuum, so no impurities can enter the chamber and affect the results of the nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Applications==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties that make them optimal for a variety of applications.

===Drug Delivery===
Materials used in drug delivery in the past ten years have primarily been [[polymers]]. However, nanotechnology has opened the door for the use of [[ceramic]]s with benefits not previously seen in [[polymers]]. The large surface area to volume ratio of nanophase materials makes it possible for large amounts of drugs to be released over long periods of time. Nanoparticles to be filled with drugs can be easily manipulated in size and composition to allow for increased [[endocytosis]] of drugs into targeted cells and increased dispersion through fenestrations in capillaries. While these benefits all relate to nanoparticles in general (including [[polymers]]), ceramics have other, unique abilities. Unlike [[polymer]]s, slow degradation of ceramics allows for longer release of the drug. [[Polymers]] also tend to swell in liquid which can cause an unwanted burst of drugs. The lack of swelling shown by most ceramics allows for increased control. Ceramics can also be created to match the chemistry of biological cells in the body increasing bioactivity and biocompatibility. Nanophase ceramic drug carriers are also able to target specific cells. This can be done by manufacturing a material to bond to the specific cell or by applying an external magnetic field, attracting the carrier to a specific location.

===Bone Substitution===
Nanophase ceramics have great potential for use in [[orthopedic medicine]]. Bone and [[collagen]] have structures on the nanoscale. Nanomaterials can be manufactured to simulate these structures which is necessary for grafts and implants to successfully adapt to and handle varying stresses. The surface properties of nanophase ceramics is also very important for bone substitution and regeneration. Nanophase ceramics have much rougher surfaces than larger materials and also have increased surface area. This promotes reactivity and absorption of proteins that assist tissue development. Nano-hydroxyapatite is one nanophase ceramic that is used as a bone substitute. Nano grain size increases the bonding, growth, and differentiation of [[osteoblasts]] onto the ceramic. The surfaces of nanophase ceramics can also be modified to be porous allowing [[osteoblasts]] to create bone within the structure. The degradation of the ceramic is also important because the rate can be changed by changing the crystallinity. This way as bone grows the substitute can diminish at a similar rate.

The '''National Oceanography Centre (NOC)''' is a [[marine science]] research and technology institution based on two sites in [[Southampton]] and [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]].   It is the UK’s largest institution for integrated sea level science, coastal and deep ocean research and technology development.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/nocs.asp | title=National Oceanography Centre: NERC 2005 Press Release | accessdate=30 June 2011 | publisher=National Oceanography Centre | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104624/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/nocs.asp | archivedate=27 September 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOC is wholly owned by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) and was formed in April 2010 by bringing together the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]]-managed activity at the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton]] and Liverpool’s [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]].

The centre was set up to work in close partnership with institutions across the UK marine science community to address key science challenges, including sea level change, the oceans’ role in climate change, predicting and simulating the behaviour of the oceans through [[computer modelling]], the future of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and long-term monitoring technologies.

== Marine science national capability ==
[[File: RRS James Cook 1.jpg|thumb|{{ship|RRS|James Cook}} returning to Southampton]]
The NOC provides the bulk of the UK’s capability to meet the needs of the country’s marine [[research community]].

National marine capability provided by the NOC includes Royal Research Ships, {{ship|RRS|James Cook}} and {{ship|RRS|Discovery|2013|6}}, deep [[submersibles]], including the [[Autosub]] [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs), advanced ocean sensors and other instruments.

Across its two sites, the National Oceanography Centre is responsible for the global mean sea level data archive, the UK’s sea level monitoring system for flood warning and climate change, the national archive of subsea sediment cores (British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility), the [[National Oceanographic Library]], which houses the nationally important {{ship|RRS|Discovery}} and [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']] archives, and the UK’s main facility for holding and distributing data concerning the marine environment.

== History ==
[[File:National Oceanography Centre Southampton UK seen from waterfront.jpg|thumb|NOC Southampton]]
[[File:National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool (1).JPG|thumb|NOC Liverpool]]
The National Oceanography Centre’s waterfront headquarters were opened in 1996 by [[Duke of Edinburgh#Dukes of Edinburgh, third creation (1947-)|HRH the Duke of Edinburgh]], as the Southampton Oceanography Centre. It brought together the University of Southampton's departments of oceanography and geology with the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, formerly based in [[Wormley, Surrey]], and Research Vessel Services, formerly based in [[Barry Docks]], [[South Wales]].

It was renamed the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton]] in 2005, again by HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, its new name reflecting its prominence in ocean and earth sciences within the UK.

Until April 2010, the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton was jointly owned by the University of Southampton and the Natural Environment Research Council.  The term National Oceanography Centre, Southampton continues to be used to describe the collaborative relationship at the waterfront campus.

The National Oceanography Centre’s Liverpool site, on the University of Liverpool campus, was formerly the [[National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool|Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] and specialises in tidal and sea level science.  It hosts the [[National Tidal and Sea Level Facility]], the [[Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level]] and the British Oceanographic Data Centre. It was formerly housed at the [[British Oceanographic Data Centre#History|Bidston Observatory]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] before moving to the [[University of Liverpool]] campus in 2004. It maintained a popular web presence displaying realtime weather and ocean data, but since mid 2013 has failed to continue to maintain these services.

== NOC Association ==
The NOC is at the centre of a strategic network of partners and associates - at universities and research institutes - working collaboratively with the Centre in its support of world-class research, technology development and training the scientists of the future. Together, these organisations form the NOC Association, sharing in the delivery of the NERC’s marine science priorities.

== Partners ==
The NOC’s partners include the [[University of Southampton]], whose Ocean and Earth Science academic unit is co-located at the NOC’s dockside headquarters, home to around 520 research scientists, engineers and technicians, ship operations and support staff, as well as around 700 [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students. The University of Liverpool is the NOC’s other hosting partner and postgraduate students are taught in a research-led environment in NOC's Joseph Proudman Building on the university's campus.

The NOC is responsible for managing UK marine science national capability. This includes provision of major facilities, programmes of sustained observing, survey, mapping, data management and other functions. The NOC also manages contracts placed by NERC with other organisations to provide some national capability functions. Such organisations are known as Delivery Partners and include:

* [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]]
* [[Scottish Association for Marine Science]]
* [[British Antarctic Survey]]
* [[British Geological Survey]]
* [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |Marine Biological Association]]
* [[Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science]] (named after [[Alister Hardy|Alistair Hardy]])

The centre is committed to international engagement and has developed a range of international partnerships through the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120320201631/http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/NMCO/about International and Strategic Partnerships Office], including an alliance of Europe’s three principal oceanographic research institutions with [[Ifremer]] of France and IFM Geomar of Germany.

The NOC is a member of the European Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) / National Oceanography Centre (NOC) - EuroGOOS|url=http://eurogoos.eu/member/natural-environment-research-council-nerc/|website=EuroGOOS|accessdate=27 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="108917">A '''nerve guidance conduit''' (also referred to as an '''artificial nerve conduit''' or '''artificial nerve graft''', as opposed to an [[autograft]]) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate [[nerve regeneration]] and is one of several clinical treatments for [[Nerve injury|nerve injuries]]. When direct [[surgical suture|suturing]] of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerve]] injuries is autologous nerve [[Medical grafting|grafting]]. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, [[neural tissue engineering]] research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the [[central nervous system]] poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-2003-ARBE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schmidt | first = C.

== Scaffold topography ==
.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Norman | first = J. J. |author2=Desai, T. A. |date=January 2006 | title = Methods for fabrication of nanoscale topography for tissue engineering scaffolds | journal = Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–101 | pmid = 16525765 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s10439-005-9005-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tissue engineering]], the three main levels of scaffold structure are considered to be:&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;
* the superstructure, the overall shape of the scaffold;
* the microstructure, the cellular level structure of the surface; and
* the nanostructure, the subcellular level structure of the surface.

=== Superstructure ===
The superstructure of a conduit or scaffold is important for simulating ''in vivo'' conditions for nerve tissue formation. The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules. Ways of forming artificial superstructure include the use of thermo-responsive hydrogels, longitudinally oriented channels, longitudinally oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous scaffolds.

==== Thermo-responsive hydrogels ====
In [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), a series of damaging events is initiated that lead to cell death and overall dysfunction, which cause the formation of an irregularly-shaped lesion cavity.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stabenfeldt| first = S. E. | author2 = García, A. J. and LaPlaca, M. C. |date=June 2006 | title = Thermoreversible laminin-functionalized hydrogel for neural tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 718–725 | doi = 10.1002/jbm.a.30638 | pmid = 16555267 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting cavity causes many problems for tissue-engineered scaffolds because invasive implantation is required, and often the scaffold does not conform to the cavity shape. In order to get around these difficulties, thermo-responsive [[hydrogels]] have been engineered to undergo solution-gelation (sol-gel) transitions, which are caused by differences in room and physiological temperatures, to facilitate implantation through in situ gelation and conformation to cavity shape caused, allowing them to be injected in a minimally invasively manner.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt;

[[Methylcellulose]] (MC) is a material with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs because of an increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in ''in vivo'' applications.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.

Another thermo-responsive gel is one that is formed by combining [[chitosan]] with glycerophosphate (GP) salt.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crompton| first = K. E. |author2=Goud, J. D. |author3=Bellamkonda, R. V. |author4=Gengenbach, T. R. |author5=Finkelstein, D. I. |author6= Horne, M. K. and Forsythe, J. S.  |date=January 2007 | title = Polylysine-functionalised thermoresponsive chitosan hydrogel for neural tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 441–449 | pmid = 16978692 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution experiences gelation at temperatures above 37&amp;nbsp;°C. Gelation of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking half an hour to initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success ''in vitro'', but the addition of [[Poly-lysine|polylysine]] is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes [[neurite]] growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though neurite outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Longitudinally oriented channels ====
Longitudinally oriented channels are macroscopic structures that can be added to a conduit in order to give the regenerating axons a well-defined guide for growing straight along the scaffold. In a scaffold with microtubular channel architecture, regenerating axons are able to extend through open longitudinal channels as they would normally extend through endoneurial tubes of peripheral nerves.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wang | first = A. |author2=Ao, Q. |author3=Cao, W. |author4=Yu, M. |author5=He, Q. |author6=Kong, L. |author7=Zhang, L. |author8= Gong, Y. and Zhang, X.  |date=October 2006 | title = Porous chitosan tubular scaffolds with knitted outer wall and controllable inner structure for nerve tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–46 | pmid = 16758450 | url = | doi = 10.1002/jbm.a.30683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the channels increase the surface area available for cell contact. The channels are usually created by inserting a needle, wire, or second polymer solution within a polymer scaffold; after stabilizing the shape of the main polymer, the needle, wire, or second polymer is removed in order to form the channels. Typically multiple channels are created; however, the scaffold can consist of just one large channel, which is simply one hollow tube.

A molding technique was created by Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an outer tube wall from chitosan.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"/&gt; In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow chitosan tube, where they are held in place by fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A chitosan solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the inner diameter of the outer tube wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through the entire length of the scaffold. Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of the scaffold became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining the scaffold shape that guides neurite extension. The inner structure provides an increase in compressive strength compared to a hollow tube alone, which can prevent collapse of the scaffold onto growing neurites. Neuro-2a cells were able to growth on the inner matrix of the scaffold, and they oriented along the channels. Although this method has only been tested on chitosan, it can be tailored to other materials.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"/&gt;

[[Lyophilization|lyophilizing]] and wire-heating process is another method of creating longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005).&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huang | first = Y. C. | author2 = Huang, Y. Y.; Huang, C. C. and Liu, H. C. |date=July 2005 | title = Manufacture of porous polymer nerve conduits through a lyophilizing and wire-heating process | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 659–664 | doi = 10.1002/jbm.b.30267 | pmid = 15909301 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A chitosan and [[acetic acid]] solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a [[liquid nitrogen]] trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen because they have a high resistance level. Temperature-controlled lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After lyophilizing, scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt;

Another way to create longitudinally oriented channels is to create a conduit from one polymer with embedded longitudinally oriented fibers from another polymer; then selectively dissolve the fibers to form longitudinally oriented channels. [[Polycaprolactone]] (PCL) fibers were embedded in a [[(Hydroxyethyl)methacrylate]] (HEMA) scaffold. PCL was chosen over poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), because it is insoluble in HEMA but soluble in [[acetone]]. This is important because HEMA was used for the main conduit material and acetone was used to selectively dissolve the polymer fibers. Extruded PCL fibers were inserted into a glass tube and the HEMA solution was injected. The number of channels created was consistent from batch to batch and the variations in fiber diameter could be reduced by creating a more controlled PCL fiber extrusion system.&lt;ref name="Flynn-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flynn | first = L. | author2 = Dalton, P. D. and Shoichet, M.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in the gel, and then selectively dissolved by acetone with sonication to create channels.

When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, it was found that the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available.&lt;ref name="Itoh-2003-AO"/&gt; While this is an effective method for creating a single channel, it does not provide as much surface area for cellular growth as the multi-channel scaffolds.

Newman et al. (2006) inserted conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a [[terpolymer]] of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping them on a small glass slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800&amp;nbsp;µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and [[Kevlar]], and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers and to some extent along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newman | first = K.

In their 2005 study, Cai et al. added Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microfilaments to hollow [[poly(lactic acid)]] (PLA) and silicon tubes. The microfiber guidance characteristics were inversely related to the fiber diameter with smaller diameters promoting better longitudinally oriented cell migration and axonal regeneration. The microfibers also promoted myelination during peripheral nerve repair.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cai | first = J. | author2 = Peng, X.; Nelson, K.

==== Stretch-grown axons ====
Mature axon tracts has been demonstrated to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pfister | first = B.

There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"/&gt; Examination by [[scanning electron microscope]] and [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] showed no signs of axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1&amp;nbsp;cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1&amp;nbsp;mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1&amp;nbsp;mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"/&gt;

==== Nanofibers scaffolds ====
Research on nanoscale fibers attempts to mimic the in vivo extracellular environment in order to promote directional growth and regeneration.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Three distinct methods for forming nanofibrous scaffolds are self-assembly, phase separation and electrospinning. However, there are many other methods for forming nanofibrous scaffolds.

Self-assembly of nanofibrous scaffolds is able to occur only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly is able to create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' a self-aligned [[collagen]]-[[Schwann cell]] matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment ''in vitro''. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional [[tissue culture]]. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2005-TE"/&gt; Soluble plasma [[fibronectin]] can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2004-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = J. B. | author2 = King, V. R.; Ward, Z.; Porter, R. A.; Priestley, J. V. &amp; Brown, R. A. |date=June 2004 | title = Fluid shear in viscous fibronectin gels allows aggregation of fibrous materials for CNS tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2769–2779 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.09.052 | pmid = 14962555 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3&amp;nbsp;cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2004-Biomaterials"/&gt;

Phase separation allows for three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds to be created without the use of specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

[[Electrospinning]] provides a robust platform for development of synthetic nerve guidance conduits. Electrospinning can serve to create scaffolds at controlled dimensions with varying chemistry and topography. Furthermore, different materials can be encapsulated within fibers including particles, growth factors, and even cells.&lt;ref name="Xu-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Xiaoyun | author2 = Woon-Chee Yee, Peter Y.K Hwang, Hanry Yu, Andrew C.A Wan, Shujun Gao, Kum-Loong Boon, Hai-Quan Mao, Kam W Leong &amp; Shu Wang|date=June 2003 | title = Peripheral nerve regeneration with sustained release of poly(phosphoester) microencapsulated nerve growth factor within nerve guide conduits| journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 13 | pages = 2405–2412| doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00109-1| pmid = 12699678 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrospinning creates fibers by electrically charging a droplet of polymer melt or solution and suspending it from a capillary. Then, an electric field is applied at one end of the capillary until the charge exceeds the surface tension, creating a polymer jet that elongates and thins. This polymer jet discharges as a Taylor cone, leaving behind electrically charged polymers, which are collected on a grounded surface as the solvent as the solvent evaporates from the jets.&lt;ref name="Christopherson-2009-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Christopherson | first = Gregory | author2 = Hongjun Song &amp; Hai-Quan Mao |date=February 2009 | title = The influence of fiber diameter of electrospun substrates on neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation| journal = Biomaterials | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 556–564 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.10.004| pmid = 18977025 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fibers have been spun with diameters ranging from less than 3&amp;nbsp;nm to over 1&amp;nbsp;µm.

(2005), aligned and random electrospun poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microfibrous and nanofibrous scaffolds were created, characterized, and compared. Fiber diameters were directly proportional to the initial polymer concentration used for electrospinning; the average diameter of aligned fibers was smaller than that of random fibers under identical processing conditions. It was shown that neural stem cells elongated parallel to the aligned electrospun fibers.&lt;ref name="Yang-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; The aligned nanofibers had a longer average neurite length compared to aligned microfibers, random microfibers, and random nanofibers. In addition, more cells differentiated on aligned nanofibers than aligned microfibers.&lt;ref name="Yang-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus, the results of this study demonstrated that aligned nanofibers may be more beneficial than nonaligned fibers or microfibers for promoting nerve regeneration.

=== Microstructure and nanostructure ===
Microstructure and nanostructure, along with superstructure are three main levels of scaffold structure that deserve consideration when creating scaffold topography.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; While the superstructure refers to the overall shape of the scaffold, the microstructure refers to the cellular level structure of the surface and the nanostructure refers to the subcellular level structure of the surface. All three levels of structure are capable of eliciting cell responses; however, there is significant interest in the response of cells to nanoscale topography motivated by the presence of numerous nanoscale structures within the extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; There are a growing number of methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanostructures (many originating from the semiconductor industry) allowing for the creation of various topographies with controlled size, shape, and chemistry.&lt;ref name="Parikh-2012-Materials Science and Engineering: C"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parikh | first = K.

==== Physical cues ====
Physical cues are formed by creating an ordered surface structure at the level of the microstructure and/or nanostructure. Physical cues on the nanoscale have been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration, orientation, contact inhibition, gene expression, and cytoskeletal formation. This allows for the direction of cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and spreading.&lt;ref name="Parikh-2012-Materials Science and Engineering: C"/&gt; There are numerous methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanoscale topographies, which can be divided into those that create ordered topographies and those that create unordered topographies.

'''Ordered topographies''' are defined as patterns that are organized and geometrically precise.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Though there are many methods for creating ordered topographies, they are usually time-consuming, requiring skill and experience and the use of expensive equipment.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''[[Photolithography]]''' involves exposing a light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is place between the light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the [[photoresist]]. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; However, because the lower limit for size is a function of the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of [[polyimide]] channels (11&amp;nbsp;µm in height and 20–60&amp;nbsp;µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mahoney | first = M. J. | author2 = Chen, R. R.; Tan, J. &amp; Saltzman, W. M. |date=March 2005 | title = The influence of microchannels on neurite growth and architecture | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 771–778 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.03.015 | pmid = 15350782 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

In '''[[electron beam lithography]]''' (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is the choice of a positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gomez | first = N. | author2 = Lu, Y.; Chen, S. &amp; Schmidt, C. E. |date=January 2007 | title = Immobilized nerve growth factor and microtopography have distinct effects on polarization versus axon elongation in hippocampal cells in culture | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–284 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.07.043 | pmid = 16919328 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5&amp;nbsp;nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, as is the case in tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40&amp;nbsp;nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, [[isopropyl alcohol]] (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patterns in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and [[Solvent casting and particulate leaching|solvent casting]].&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2&amp;nbsp;µm wide and 400 and 800&amp;nbsp;nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

'''[[X-ray lithography]]''' is another method for forming ordered patterns that can be used to investigate the role that topography plays in promoting neuritogenesis. The mask parameters determine the pattern periodicity, but ridge width and depth are determined by the etching conditions. In a study, ridges were created with periods ranging from 400 through 4000&amp;nbsp;nm, widths ranging from 70 through 1900&amp;nbsp;nm, and a groove depth of 600&amp;nbsp;nm; developing neurites demonstrated contact guidance with features as small as 70&amp;nbsp;nm and greater than 90% of the neurites were within 10 degrees of parallel alignment with the ridges and grooves.&lt;ref name="Foley-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Foley | first = J.

J. |date=June 2005 | title = Cooperative modulation of neuritogenesis by PC12 cells by topography and nerve growth factor | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 17 | pages = 3639–3644 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.048 | pmid = 15621254 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was not a significant difference in orientation with respect to the feature sizes used. The number of neurites per cell was constrained by the ridges and grooves, producing bipolar rather than branching phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Foley-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

'''Unordered topographies''' are generally created by processes that occur spontaneously during other processing; the patterns are random in orientation and organization with imprecise or no control over feature geometry.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; The advantage to creating unordered topographies over ordered is that the processes are often less time consuming, less expensive, and do not require great skill and experience. Unordered topographies can be created by polymer demixing, colloidal lithography and chemical etching.

In '''polymer demixing''', polymer blends experience spontaneous phase separation; it often occurs during conditions such as spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; There is not much control in the horizontal direction, though the vertical direction of the features can be precisely controlled. Because the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height [[nanotopography|nanotopographies]].&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''Colloidal lithography''' is inexpensive and can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used to etch away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''[[Chemical milling|Chemical etching]]''' involves soaking the material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until the surface is etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it can be considered a surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with [[nanotopography|nanotopographies]]. [[Silicon]] wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of roughness (20–50&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

==== Chemical cues ====
In addition to creating topography with physical cues, it can be created with chemical cues by selectively depositing polymer solution in patterns on the surface of a substrate. There are different methods for depositing the chemical cues. Two methods for dispensing chemical solutions include stripe patterning and piezoelectric microdispensing.

'''Stripe-patterned polymer films''' can be formed on solid substrates by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, and has no restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm/s.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tsuruma | first = A. | author2 = Tanaka, M.; Yamamoto, S.; Fukushima, N.; Yabu, H. &amp; Shimomura, M. | year = 2006 | title = Topographical control of neurite extension on stripe-patterned polymer films | journal = Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects | volume = 284–285 | pages = 470–474 | pmid = | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.colsurfa.2005.11.100 | last3 = Yamamoto | first3 = Sadaaki | last4 = Fukushima | first4 = Nobuyuki | last5 = Yabu | first5 = Hiroshi | last6 = Shimomura | first6 = Masatsugu }}&lt;/ref&gt; A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed at the edge of the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100&amp;nbsp;µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1&amp;nbsp;µm, 3.6 and 8.4&amp;nbsp;µm, and 4.3 and 12.7&amp;nbsp;µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt; Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2&amp;nbsp;µm, spacing: 6.1&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt; However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3&amp;nbsp;µm, spacing: 12.7&amp;nbsp;µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt;

'''Microdispensing''' was used to create micropatterns on polystyrene culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive [[bovine serum albumin]] (BSA) solutions.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gustavsson | first = P. | author2 = Johansson, F.; Kanje, M.; Wallman, L. &amp; Linsmeier, C. E. |date=February 2007 | title = Neurite guidance on protein micropatterns generated by a piezoelectric microdispenser | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1141–1151 | pmid = 17109955 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microdispenser is a [[piezoelectric]] element attached to a push-bar on top of a channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.

For patterns containing 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/ml laminin, a higher proportion of neurites grew on the microdispensed lines than between the lines.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; On 10&amp;nbsp;mg/ml and 1&amp;nbsp;mg/ml BSA protein patterns and fatty-acid free BSA protein patterns a significant number of neurites avoided the protein lines and grew between the lines. Thus, the fatty-acid-containing BSA lines were just as non-permissive for neurite growth as lines containing BSA with fatty acids. Because microdispensing does not require direct contact with the substrate surfaces, this technique can utilitze surfaces with delicate micro- or nanotopology that could be destroyed by contact. It is possible to vary the amount of protein deposited by dispensing more or less droplets. An advantage of microdispensing is that patterns can be created quickly in 5–10 minutes. Because the piezoelectric microdispenser does not require heating, heat-sensitive proteins and fluids as well as living cells can be dispensed.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

== Scaffold material ==
The selection of the scaffold material is perhaps the most important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It is important to note that the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

=== Hydrogel ===
[[Hydrogel]]s are a class of biomaterials that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, and the ability to be injected as a liquid that gels.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ma | first = W. | author2 = Fitzgerald, W.; Liu, Q. Y.; O'Shaughnessy, T. J.; Maric, D.; Lin, H. J.; Alkon, D. L. &amp; Barker, J.

=== Synthetic polymer ===
A [[synthetic polymer]] may be non-degradable or degradable. For the purpose of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate is dependent on the molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Because of a [[methyl group]], [[lactic acid]] is more hydrophobic than [[glycolic acid]] causing its hydrolysis to be slower.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Wu-2006-JHUST"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wu | first = Y. | author2 = Zheng, Q.; Du, J.; Song, Y.; Wu, B. &amp; Guo, X. | year = 2006 | title = Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells | journal = Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 594–596 | pmid = 17219978 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s11596-006-0530-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2006-JNM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pfister | first = B.

==== Collagen-terpolymer ====
[[Collagen]] is a major component of the [[extracellular matrix]], and it is found in the supporting tissues of peripheral nerves. A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and cross-linked with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt; The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a cross-linker to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt; Because the collagen-terpolymer (collagen-TERP) hydrogel lacks a bioactive component, a study attached to it a common cell adhesion peptide found in [[laminin]] (YIGSR) in order to enhance its cell adhesion properties.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt;

==== Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) family ====
The polymers in the PLGA family include poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), and their copolymer poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). All three polymers have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for employment in various devices. These polymers are brittle and they do not have regions for permissible chemical modification; in addition, they degrade by bulk rather than by surface, which is not a smooth and ideal degradation process.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; In an attempt to overcome the lack of functionalities, free amines have been incorporated into their structures from which peptides can be tethered to control cell attachment and behavior.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt;

==== Methacrylated dextran (Dex-MA) copolymerized with aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA) ====
[[Dextran]] is a polysaccharide derived from bacteria; it is usually produced by enzymes from certain strains of [[leuconostoc]] or [[Streptococcus]]. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. Cross-linked dextran hydrogel beads have been widely used as low protein-binding matrices for [[column chromatography]] applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lévesque | first = S. G. |author2=Shoichet, M. S. |date=October 2006 | title = Synthesis of cell-adhesive dextran hydrogels and macroporous scaffolds | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 30 | pages = 5277–5285 | pmid = 16793132 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been until recently that dextran hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the macroporous geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) ====
A novel biodegradable, tough elastomer has been developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because it is able to recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a [[Young's modulus]] of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Polyethylene glycol hydrogel ====
[[Polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) hydrogels are biocompatible and proven to be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mahoney | first = M. J. |author2=Anseth, K. S. |date=April 2006 | title = Three-dimensional growth and function of neural tissue in degradable polyethylene glycol hydrogels | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–2274 | pmid = 16318872 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able to serve as a scaffold for axon regeneration.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

=== Biological polymers ===
There are advantages to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are very likely to have good biocompatibility and be easily degraded, because they are already present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, there is always the possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; In the production of naturally-derived materials there will also be batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"/&gt; Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"/&gt; Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.

==== Polysialic acid (PSA) ====
Polysialic acid (PSA) is a relatively new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for artificial nerve conduits. It is a homopolymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues and a dynamically regulated posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Recent studies have demonstrated that polysialylated NCAM (polySia-NCAM) promotes regeneration in the motor system.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haile | first = Y. |author2=Haastert, K. |author3=Cesnulevicius, K. |author4=Stummeyer, K. |author5=Timmer, M. |author6=Berski. S. |author7=Dräger, G. |author8= Gerardy-Schahn, R. and Grothe, C.  |date=February 2007 | title = Culturing of glial and neuronal cells on polysialic acid | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1163–1173 | pmid = 17123601 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for induced degradation by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved in steering processes like neuritogenesis, axonal path finding, and neuroblast migration.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; Animals with PSA genetically knocked out express a lethal phenotype, which has unsuccessful path finding; nerves connecting the two brain hemispheres were aberrant or missing.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus PSA is vital for proper nervous system development.

==== Collagen Type I/III ====
[[Collagen]] is the major component of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able to be controlled by crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt; Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt; This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt;

==== Spider silk fiber ====
[[Spider silk]] fibers are shown to promote cellular adhesion, proliferation, and vitality. Allmeling, Jokuszies et al. showed that Schwann cells attach quickly and firmly to the silk fibers, growing in a bipolar shape; proliferation and survival rates were normal on the silk fibers.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allmeling | first = C. | author2 =  Jokuszies, A.; Reimers, K.; Kall, S. and Vogt P. M. |date=July–September 2006 | title = Use of spider silk fibres as an innovative material in a biocompatible artificial nerve conduit | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 770–777 | pmid = 16989736 | url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00436.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They used spider silk fibers to create a nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in a short amount of time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow ''in vivo'' after PNS injury.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt; Spider silk has not been used in tissue engineering until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt; Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks and the fact that it does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt;

==== Silkworm silk fibroin ====
In addition to spiders, silkworms are another source of silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of [[fibroin]] protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered that the cause of the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yang | first = Y. | author2 = Chen, X.; Ding, F.; Zhang, P.; Liu, J. and Gu, X. |date=March 2007 | title = Biocompatibility evaluation of silk fibroin with peripheral nerve tissues and cells in vitro | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1643–1652 | pmid = 17188747 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Chitosan ====
[[Chitosan]] and [[chitin]] belong to a family of biopolymers composed of β(1–4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine subunits.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freier | first = T. | author2 = Koh, H. S.; Kazazian, K. and Shoichet, M. S. |date=October 2005 | title = Controlling cell adhesion and degradation of chitosan films by N-acetylation | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 29 | pages = 5872–5878 | pmid = 15949553 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitosan is formed by alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant natural polymer after cellulose.&lt;ref name="Itoh-2003-AO"/&gt; Chitosan is a biodegradable polysaccharide that has been useful in many biomedical applications such as a chelating agent, drug carrier, membrane, and water treatment additive.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; Chitosan is soluble in dilute aqueous solutions, but precipitates into a gel at a neutral pH.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; It does not support neural cell attachment and proliferation well, but can be enhanced by ECM-derived peptide attachment. Chitosan also contains weak mechanical properties, which are more challenging to overcome.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

Degree of acetylation (DA) for soluble chitosan ranges from 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; A study was conducted to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using [[acetic anhydride]] or [[alkaline hydrolysis]]. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan ''in vivo'' by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help in the development of a nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.

==== Aragonite ====
[[Aragonite]] scaffolds have recently been shown to support the growth of neurons from rat hippocampi. Shany et al. (2006) proved that aragonite matrices can support the growth of astrocytic networks ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. Thus, aragonite scaffolds may be useful for nerve tissue repair and regeneration. It is hypothesized that aragonite-derived Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for promoting cell adherence and cell–cell contact. This is probably carried out through the help of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent adhesion molecules such as cadherins.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shany | first = B. |author2=Peretz, H. |author3=Blinder, P. |author4=Lichtenfeld, Y. |author5=Jeger, R. |author6= Vago, R. and Baranes, D.  |date=July 2006 | title = Aragonite crystalline biomatrices support astrocytic tissue formation in vitro and in vivo | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1763–1773 | pmid = 16889507 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.1763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aragonite crystalline matrices have many advantages over hydrogels. They have larger pores, which allows for better cell growth, and the material is bioactive as a result of releasing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which promotes cell adhesion and survival. In addition, the aragonite matrices have higher mechanical strength than hydrogels, allowing them to withstand more pressure when pressed into an injured tissue.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt;

==== Alginate ====
Alginate is a polysaccharide that readily forms chains; it can be cross-linked at its carboxylic groups with multivalent cations such as Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prang | first = P. |author2=Müller, R. |author3=Eljaouhari, A. |author4=Heckmann, K. |author5=Kunz, W. |author6=Weber, T. |author7=Faber, C. |author8=Vroemen, M. |author9= Bogdahn, U. and Weidner, N. |displayauthors=9  |date=July 2006 | title = The promotion of oriented axonal regrowth in the injured spinal cord by alginate-based anisotropic capillary hydrogels | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 19 | pages = 3560–3569 | pmid = 16500703 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.053 | last10 = Weidner | first10 = N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and have been used in tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.

Prang et al. (2006) assessed the capacity of ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, in addition to being able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target ''in vivo'' after a spinal cord injury.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Hyaluronic acid hydrogel ====
[[Hyaluronic acid]] (HA) is a widely used biomaterial as a result of its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hou | first = S. |author2=Xu, Q. |author3=Tian, W. |author4=Cui, F. |author5=Cai, Q. |author6= Ma, J. and Lee, I. S.  | date = October 15, 2005 | title = The repair of brain lesion by implantation of hyaluronic acid hydrogels modified with laminin | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–70 | pmid = 15978668 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.04.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"/&gt; HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"/&gt; These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.

== Cellular therapies ==
In addition to scaffold material and physical cues, biological cues can also be incorporated into a bioartificial nerve conduit in the form of cells. In the nervous system there are many different cell types that help support the growth and maintenance of neurons. These cells are collectively termed glial cells. Glial cells have been investigated in an attempt to understand the mechanisms behind their abilities to promote axon regeneration. Three types of glial cells are discussed: Schwann cells, astrocytes, and olfactory ensheathing cells. In addition to glial cells, stem cells also have potential benefit for repair and regeneration because many are able to differentiate into neurons or glial cells. This article briefly discusses the use of adult, transdifferentiated mesenchymal, ectomesenchymal, neural and neural progenitor stem cells.

=== Glial cells ===
[[Glial cells]] are necessary for supporting the growth and maintenance of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Most glial cells are specific to either the peripheral or central nervous system. Schwann cells are located in the peripheral nervous system where they myelinate the axons of neurons. Astrocytes are specific to the central nervous system; they provide nutrients, physical support, and insulation for neurons. They also form the blood brain barrier. Olfactory ensheathing cells, however, cross the CNS-PNS boundary, because they guide olfactory receptor neurons from the PNS to the CNS.

==== Schwann cells ====
[[Schwann cells]] (SC) are crucial to peripheral nerve regeneration; they play both structural and functional roles. Schwann cells are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a peripheral nerve is damaged, Schwann cells alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation to become involved in [[Wallerian degeneration]] and Bungner bands.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; In Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release neurotrophic factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using Schwann cells in neural tissue engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate Schwann cells and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nie | first = X. |author2=Zhang, Y. J. |author3=Tian, W. D. |author4=Jiang, M. |author5=Dong, R. |author6= Chen, J. W. and Jin, Y.  |date=January 2007 | title = Improvement of peripheral nerve regeneration by a tissue-engineered nerve filled with ectomesenchymal stem cells | journal = International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–38 | pmid = 17169530 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.ijom.2006.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eguchi et al. (2003) have investigated the use of magnetic fields in order to align Schwann cells. They used a horizontal type superconducting magnet, which produces an 8 T field at its center. Within 60 hours of exposure, Schwann cells aligned parallel to the field; during the same interval, Schwann cells not exposed oriented in a random fashion. It is hypothesized that differences in magnetic field susceptibility of membrane components and cytoskeletal elements may cause the magnetic orientation.&lt;ref name="Eguchi-2003-NL"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eguchi | first = Y. | author2 = Ogiue-Ikeda, M. and Ueno, S. |date=November 2003 | title = Control of orientation of rat Schwann cells using an 8-T static magnetic field | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 130–132 | pmid = 14583398 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3940(03)00719-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collagen fibers were also exposed to the magnetic field, and within 2 hours, they aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, while collagen fibers formed a random meshwork pattern without magnetic field exposure. When cultured on the collagen fibers, Schwann cells aligned along the magnetically oriented collagen after two hours of 8-T magnetic field exposure. In contrast, the Schwann cells randomly oriented on the collagen fibers without magnetic field exposure. Thus, culture on collagen fibers allowed Schwann cells to be oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field and oriented much quicker.&lt;ref name="Eguchi-2003-NL"/&gt;

These findings may be useful for aligning Schwann cells in a nervous system injury to promote the formation of bands of Bungner, which are crucial for maintaining the endoneurial tube that guides the regrowing axons back to their targets. It is nearly impossible to align Schwann cells by external physical techniques; thus, the discovery of an alternative technique for alignment is significant. However, the technique developed still has its disadvantages, namely that it takes a considerable amount of energy to sustain the magnetic field for extended periods.

Studies have been conducted in attempts to enhance the migratory ability of Schwann cells. Schwann cell migration is regulated by integrins with ECM molecules such as fibronectin and laminin. In addition, neural cell adhesion molecule ([[NCAM]]) is known to enhance Schwann cell motility ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lavdas | first = A. A. | author2 = Franceschini, I.; Dubois-Dalcq, M. and Matsas, R. |date=June 2006 | title = Schwann cells genetically engineered to express PSA show enhanced migratory potential without impairment of their myelinating ability in vitro | journal = Glia | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 868–878 | pmid = 16598779 | url = | doi = 10.1002/glia.20340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAM is a glycoprotein that is expressed on axonal and Schwann cell membranes. Polysialic acid (PSA) is synthesized on NCAM by polysialyltransferase (PST) and sialyltransferase X (STX).&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt; During the development of the CNS, PSA expression on NCAM is upregulated until postnatal stages. However, in the adult brain PSA is found only in regions with high [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. PSA expression does not occur on Schwann cells.

Lavdas et al. (2006) investigated whether sustained expression of PSA on Schwann cells enhances their migration. Schwann cells were tranduced with a retroviral vector encoding STX in order to induce PSA expression. PSA-expressing Schwann cells did obtain enhanced motility as demonstrated in a gap bridging assay and after grafting in postnatal forebrain slice cultures.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt; PSA expression did not alter molecular and morphological differentiation. The PSA-expressing Schwann cells were able to myelinate CNS axons in cerebellar slices, which is not normally possible ''in vivo''. It is hopeful that these PSA-expressing Schwann cells will be able to migrate throughout the CNS without loss of myelinating abilities and may become useful for regeneration and myelination of axons in the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt;

==== Astrocytes ====
[[Astrocytes]] are glial cells that are abundant in the central nervous system. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and [[fibroblasts]]; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.

The three distinct ways by which the cells acquired a 3D shape are:&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt;
# adhering to surface and following the 3D contour
# stretching some processes between 2 curvatures
# extending processes in 3D within cell layers when located within multilayer tissue

In conventional cell culture, growth is restricted to one plane, causing monolayer formation with most cells contacting the surface; however, the 3D curvature of the aragonite surface allows multiple layers to develop and for astrocytes far apart to contact each other. It is important to promote process formation similar to 3D ''in vivo'' conditions, because astrocytic process morphology is essential in guiding directionality of regenerating axons.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; The aragonite topography provides a high surface area to volume ratio and lacks edges, which leads to a reduction of the culture edge effect.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; Crystalline matrices such as the aragonite mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches ''in vivo'' conditions.

==== Olfactory ensheathing cells ====
The mammalian primary [[olfactory system]] has retained the ability to continuously regenerate during adulthood.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ruitenberg | first = M. J. | author2 = Vukovic, J.; Sarich, J.; Busfield, S. J. and Plant, G. W. |date=March–April 2006 | title = Olfactory ensheathing cells: characteristics, genetic engineering, and therapeutic potential | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 23 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 468–478 | pmid = 16629630 | url = | doi = 10.1089/neu.2006.23.468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olfactory receptor neurons]] have an average lifespan of 6–8 weeks and therefore must be replaced by cells differentiated from the stem cells that are within a layer at the nearby epithelium's base. The new olfactory receptor neurons must project their axons through the CNS to an [[olfactory bulb]] in order to be functional. Axonal growth is guided by the glial composition and cytoarchitecture of the olfactory bulb in addition to the presence of [[olfactory ensheathing cells]] (OECs).&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;

It is postulated that OECs originate in the [[olfactory placode]], suggesting a different developmental origin than other similar nervous system microglia.

Another interesting concept is that OECs are found in both the peripheral and central nervous system portions of the primary olfactory system, that is, the olfactory epithelium and bulb.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;

OECs are similar to Schwann cells in that they provide an upregulation of low-affinity [[NGF receptor p75]] following injury; however, unlike Schwann cells they produce lower levels of [[neurotrophins]]. Several studies have shown evidence of OECs being able to support regeneration of lesioned axons, but these results are often unable to be reproduced.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;
Regardless, OECs have been investigated thoroughly in relation to spinal cord injuries, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], and other neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers suggest that these cells possess a unique ability to remyelinate injured neurons.&lt;ref name=Harberts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harberts|first=Erin|title=Human herpesvirus-6 entry into the central nervous system through the olfactory pathway|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13734–9|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105143108 |pmid=21825120|last2=Yao|first2=K.|last3=Wohler|first3=J.

OECs have properties similar to those of [[astrocytes]],&lt;ref name=CD46&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Cassiani-Ingoni | first1 = R.| last2 = Greenstone | first2 = H.

=== Stem cells ===
[[Stem cells]] are characterized by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be unipotent, multipotent, or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barrilleaux | first = B. | author2 = Phinney, D. G.; Prockop, D. J. and O'Connor, K. C. |date=November 2006 | title = Review: Ex Vivo Engineering of Living Tissues with Adult Stem Cells | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 3007–3019 | pmid = 17518617 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.3007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluripotent stem cells can become cells derived from any of the three embryonic germ layers.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"/&gt; Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.

==== Adult stem cells ====
Adult stem cells are not able to proliferate and differentiate as effectively ''in vitro'' as they are able to ''in vivo''. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, but it is difficult to isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"/&gt; More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt;

==== Mesenchymal stem cells ====
[[Mesenchymal stem cells]] are adult stem cells that are located in the bone marrow; they are able to differentiate into lineages of mesodermal origin. Some examples of tissue they form are [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[fat]], and [[tendon]]. MSCs are obtained by aspiration of bone marrow. Many factors promote the growth of MSCs including: [[platelet-derived growth factor]], [[epidermal growth factor]] β, and [[insulin-like growth factor-1]]. In addition to their normal differentiation paths, MSCs can be transdifferentiated along nonmesenchymal lineages such as astrocytes, neurons, and PNS myelinating cells. MSCs are potentially useful for nerve regeneration strategies because:&lt;ref name="Keilhoff-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keilhoff | first = G. | author2 = Goihl, A.; Stang, F.; Wolf, G. and Fansa, H. |date=June 2006 | title = Peripheral nerve tissue engineering: autologous Schwann cells vs. transdifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1451–1465 | pmid = 16846343 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.1451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# their use is not an ethical concern
# no immunosuppression is needed
# they are an abundant and accessible resource
# they tolerate genetic manipulations

Keilhoff et al. (2006) performed a study comparing the nerve regeneration capacity of non-differentiated and transdifferentiated MSCs to [[Schwann cell]]s in devitalized muscle grafts bridging a 2-cm gap in the rat sciatic nerve. All cells were autologous. The transdifferentiated MSCs were cultured in a mixture of factors in order to promote Schwann cell-like cell formation. The undifferentiated MSCs demonstrated no regenerative capacity, while the transdifferentiated MSCs showed some regenerative capacity, though it did not reach the capacity of the Schwann cells.&lt;ref name="Keilhoff-2006-TE"/&gt;

==== Ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) ====
The difficulty of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation is a large obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; EMSCs are [[multipotent]] and possess a self-renewing capacity. They can be thought of as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with [[dorsal root ganglion]] and motor nerve development. EMSC [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and [[neurotrophic factors]] essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines [[GDNF]], basic [[fibroblast growth factor]] and [[platelet-derived growth factor]], which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating [[MAP kinases]]. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10&amp;nbsp;mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. [[Myelinated]] axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.

==== Neural progenitor cells ====
Inserting neurons into a bioartificial nerve conduit seems like the most obvious method for replacing damaged nerves; however, neurons are unable to proliferate and they are often short-lived in culture. Thus, neural progenitor cells are more promising candidates for replacing damaged and degenerated neurons because they are self-renewing, which allows for the ''in vitro'' production of many cells with minimal donor material.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; In order to confirm that the new neurons formed from neural progenitor cells are a part of a functional network, the presence of synapse formation is required. A study by Ma, Fitzgerald et al. is the first demonstration of murine neural stem and progenitor cell-derived functional synapse and neuronal network formation on a 3D collagen matrix. The neural progenitor cells expanded and spontaneously differentiated into excitable neurons and formed synapses; furthermore, they retained the ability to differentiate into the three neural tissue lineages.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; It was also demonstrated that not only active synaptic vesicle recycling occurred, but also that excitatory and inhibitory connections capable of generating action potentials spontaneously were formed.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; Thus, neural progenitor cells are a viable and relatively unlimited source for creating functional neurons.

==== Neural stem cells ====
[[Neural stem cells]] (NSCs) have the capability to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The [[neurotrophic factor]]s used were [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[fibroblast growth factor]]-2 (FGF-2), [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against [[nestin (protein)|nestin]], β-[[tubulin]] III, and [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]], which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively.&lt;ref name="Nakajima-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nakajima | first = M. |author2=Ishimuro, T. |author3=Kato, K. |author4=Ko, I.

== Neurotrophic factors ==
Currently, [[neurotrophic factors]] are being intensely studied for use in bioartificial nerve conduits because they are necessary ''in vivo'' for directing axon growth and regeneration. In studies, neurotrophic factors are normally used in conjunction with other techniques such as biological and physical cues created by the addition of cells and specific topographies. The neurotrophic factors may or may not be immobilized to the scaffold structure, though immobilization is preferred because it allows for the creation of permanent, controllable gradients. In some cases, such as [[neural drug delivery systems]], they are loosely immobilized such that they can be selectively released at specified times and in specified amounts. Drug delivery is the next step beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits.

== Biomimetic materials ==
Many biomaterials used for nerve guidance conduits are [[biomimetic materials]]. Biomimetic materials are materials that have been design such that they elicit specified cellular responses mediated by interactions with scaffold-tethered peptides from ECM proteins; essentially, the incorporation of cell-binding peptides into biomaterials via chemical or physical modification.&lt;ref name="Shin-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shin | first = H. | author2 = Jo, S. and Mikos, A. G. |date=November 2003 | title = Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 24 | pages = 4353–4364 | pmid = 12922148 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00339-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synergism ==
[[Synergy|Synergism]] often occurs when two elements are combined; it is an interaction between two elements that causes an effect greater than the combined effects of each element separately. Synergism is evident in the combining of scaffold material and topography with cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors, and biomimetic materials. Investigation of synergism is the next step after individual techniques have proven to be successful by themselves. The combinations of these different factors need to be carefully studied in order to optimize synergistic effects.

=== Optimizing neurotrophic factor combinations ===

It was hypothesized that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of [[Nerve growth factor|NGF]], glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor ([[GDNF]]), and ciliary neurotrophic factor ([[CNTF]]) was presented to [[Dorsal root ganglion]] cultures ''in vitro''.

E. |date=June 2006 | title = Optimizing neurotrophic factor combinations for neurite outgrowth | journal = Journal of Neural Engineering | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–179 | pmid = 16705273 | url = | doi = 10.1088/1741-2560/3/2/011 | bibcode = 2006JNEng...3..172D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that there is not a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This was hypothesized to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients.&lt;ref name="Deister-2006-JNE"/&gt; Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.

=== Combination of neural cell adhesion molecules and GFD-5 ===
[[Cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) and neurotrophic factors embedded together into biocompatible matrices is a relatively new concept being investigated.&lt;ref name="Niere-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Niere | first = M. | author2 = Braun, B.; Gass, R.; Sturany, S. and Volkmer, H. |date=June 2006 | title = Combination of engineered neural cell adhesion molecules and GDF-5 for improved neurite extension in nerve guide concepts | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 18 | pages = 3432–3440 | pmid = 16497371 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMs of the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]] (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate neuronal differentiation. [[Neurotrophic factor]]s such as NGF and [[growth differentiation factor]] 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration ''in vivo''. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are not delivered individually.&lt;ref name="Niere-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; Not only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.

=== Topography in synergy with chemical and biological cues ===
The effect of presenting multiple stimuli types such as chemical, physical, and biological cues on neural progenitor cell differentiation has not been explored. A study was conducted in which three different stimuli were presented to adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs): postnatal rat type-1 astrocytes (biological), laminin (chemical), and micropatterned substrate (physical).&lt;ref name="Recknor-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Recknor | first = J.

However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, the cells were stained with antibodies for class III β-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively. The greatest amount of differentiation was seen with AHPCs cultured on patterned substrates with astrocytes.&lt;ref name="Recknor-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14616">'''Neuronal tracing''', or '''neuron reconstruction''' is a technique used in [[neuroscience]] to determine the [[neural pathway|pathway]] of the [[neurite]]s or neuronal processes, the [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s, of a [[neuron]]. From a sample preparation point of view, it may refer to some of the following as well as other genetic neuron labeling techniques,

* [[Anterograde tracing]], for labeling from the cell body to synapse;
* [[Retrograde tracing]], for labeling from the synapse to cell body;
* [[Viral neuronal tracing]], for a technique which can be used to label in either direction;
* Manual tracing of neuronal imagery.

In broad sense, neuron tracing is more often related to digital reconstruction of a neuron's morphology from imaging data of above samples.

== Digital neuronal reconstruction and neuronal tracing ==

Digital reconstruction or tracing of neuron morphology is a fundamental task in computational neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=Hanchuan|last2=Roysam|first2=Badri|last3=Ascoli|first3=Giorgio|title=Automated image computing reshapes computational neuroscience|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2013|volume=14|page=293|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-293|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/293|pmid=24090217|pmc=3853071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meijering|first1=Erik|title=Neuron Tracing in Perspective|journal=Cytometry Part A|date=2010|volume=77|issue=7|pages=693–704|doi=10.1002/cyto.a.20895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz E|title=Computational neuroscience|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|isbn=0-262-19291-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also critical for mapping neuronal circuits based on advanced microscope images, usually based on light microscopy (e.g. laser scanning microscopy, bright field imaging) or electron microscopy or other methods. Due to the high complexity of neuron morphology and often seen heavy noise in such images, as well as the typically encountered massive amount of image data, it has been widely viewed as one of the most challenging computational tasks for computational neuroscience. Many image analysis based methods have been proposed to trace neuron morphology, usually in 3D, manually, semi-automatically or completely automatically. There are normally two processing steps: generation and proof editing of a reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=H., Long, F., Zhao, T., and Myers, E.W.|title=Proof-editing is the bottleneck of 3D neuron reconstruction: the problem and solutions|journal=Neuroinformatics|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=103–105|ref=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9090-x|doi=10.1007/s12021-010-9090-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=H., Tang, J., Xiao, H., Bria, A., et al.,|title=Virtual finger boosts three-dimensional imaging and microsurgery as well as terabyte volume image visualization and analysis|journal=Nature Communications|date=2014|doi=10.1038/ncomms5342|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140711/ncomms5342/full/ncomms5342.html|volume=5|pmid=25014658|pmc=4104457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The need to describe or reconstruct a neuron's morphology probably began already in early days when neurons were labeled or visualized using [[Golgi's method]]s. Many of the known neuron types, such as [[pyramidal neurons]] and [[Chandelier cells]], were described based on their morphological characterization.
[[File:The first computer-assisted neuron reconstruction system.png|thumb|''The first computerized microscope for analyzing neuronal morphology created by Dr. Edmund Glaser and Dr. Hendrik Van der Loos in the 1960’s'']]
The first computer-assisted neuron reconstruction system, now known as [http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida Neurolucida], was developed by Dr. Edmund Glaser and Dr. Hendrik Van der Loos in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaser|first=E. M.|last2=Vanderloos|first2=H.|date=1965-01-01|title=A SEMI-AUTOMATIC COMPUTER-MICROSCOPE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF NEURONAL MORPHOLOGY|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=12|pages=22–31|issn=0018-9294|pmid=14291539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern approaches to trace a neuron started when digitized pictures of neurons were acquired using microscopes. Initially this was done in 2D. Quickly after the advanced 3D imaging, especially the [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence imaging]] and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopic imaging]], there were a huge demand of tracing neuron morphology from these imaging data.

===Methods===
[[File:Neuron reconstruction and tracing illustration.png|thumb|Schematic illustration of digital tracing of a neuron's morphology]]

Neurons can be often traced manually either in 2D or 3D. To do so, one may either directly paint the trajectory of neuronal processes in individual 2D sections of a 3D image volume and manage to connect them, or use the [http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140711/ncomms5342/full/ncomms5342.html 3D Virtual Finger] painting which directly converts any 2D painted trajectory in a projection image to real 3D neuron processes. The major limitation of manual tracing of neurons is the huge amount of labor in the work.

Automated reconstructions of neurons can be done using model (e.g. spheres or tubes) fitting and marching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Kofahi, K.A.|title=Rapid automated three-dimensional tracing of neurons from confocal image stacks|journal=IEEE Trans. Inf. Technol. Biomed.|date=2002|volume=6|pages=171–187|doi=10.1109/titb.2002.1006304|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; pruning of over-reconstruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=H.|title=Automatic 3D neuron tracing using all-path pruning|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=27|issue=13|page=i239-i247|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr237|display-authors=etal|pmc=3117353}}&lt;/ref&gt; minimal cost connection of key points, ray-bursting and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez, A.|title=Three-dimensional neuron tracing by voxel scooping|journal=J.

Methods|date=2009|volume=184|pages=169–175|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.07.021|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeletonization is a critical step in automated neuron reconstruction, but in the case of all-path-pruning and its variants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiao|first1=H|title=APP2: automatic tracing of 3D neuron morphology based on hierarchical pruning of gray-weighted image distance-trees|journal=Bioinformatics|date=2013|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1448–1454|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt170|pmid=23603332|display-authors=etal|pmc=3661058}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is combined with estimation of model parameters (e.g. tube diameters). The major limitation of automated tracing is the lack of precision especially when the neuron morphology is complicated or the image has substantial amount of noise.

Semi-automated neuron tracing often depends on two strategies. One is to run the completely automated neuron tracing followed by manual curation of such reconstructions. The alternative way is to produce some prior knowledge, such as the termini locations of a neuron, with which a neuron can be more easily traced automatically. Semi-automated tracing is often thought to be a balanced solution that has acceptable time cost and reasonably good reconstruction accuracy. The Open Source tool [[Vaa3D]]-Neuron, [http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida360 Neurolucida 360], Imaris Filament Tracer and [https://www.drvtechnologies.com/aivia5 Aivia] all provide both categories of methods.

Tracing of electron microscopy image is thought to be more challenging than tracing light microscopy images, while the latter is still quite difficult, according to the [http://diademchallenge.org/ DIADEM competition].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Y|title=The DIADEM and beyond|journal=Neuroinformatics|date=2011|volume=9|pages=99–102|doi=10.1007/s12021-011-9102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tracing electron microscopy data, manual tracing is used more often than the alternative automated or semi-automated methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Helmstaedter M, Briggman KL, Denk W |title=High-accuracy neurite reconstruction for high-throughput neuroanatomy|journal=Nat Neurosci|date=2011|volume=14|issue=8|pages=1081–1088|doi=10.1038/nn.2868}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tracing light microscopy data, more times the automated or semi-automated methods are used.

Since tracing electron microscopy images takes substantial amount time, collaborative manual tracing software is useful. Crowdsourcing is an alternative way to effectively collect collaborative manual reconstruction results for such image data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|title=Space–time wiring specificity supports direction selectivity in the retina|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=509|pages=331–336|doi=10.1038/nature13240|display-authors=etal|pmid=24805243|pmc=4074887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools and software===
A number of neuron tracing tools especially software packages are available. One comprehensive Open Source software package that contains implementation of a number of neuron tracing methods developed in different research groups as well as many neuron utilities functions such as quantitative measurement, parsing, comparison, is [http://home.penglab.com/proj/vaa3d/home/index.html Vaa3D and its Vaa3D-Neuron modules]. Some other free tools such as [http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/tools-ns.html NeuronStudio] also provide tracing function based on specific methods. Neuroscientists also use commercial tools such as [http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida Neurolucida], [http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida360 Neurolucida 360], [https://www.drvtechnologies.com/aivia5 Aivia], Amira, etc. to trace and analyse neurons. Recent studies show that Neurolucida is cited over 7 times more than all other available neuron tracing programs combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halavi|first=Maryam|last2=Hamilton|first2=Kelly A.|last3=Parekh|first3=Ruchi|last4=Ascoli|first4=Giorgio A.|date=2012-01-01|title=Digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology: three decades of research trends|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=6|pages=49|doi=10.3389/fnins.2012.00049|issn=1662-453X|pmc=3332236|pmid=22536169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the most widely used and versatile system to produce neuronal reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aguiar|first=Paulo|last2=Sousa|first2=Mafalda|last3=Szucs|first3=Peter|date=2013-06-14|title=Versatile Morphometric Analysis and Visualization of the Three-Dimensional Structure of Neurons|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9188-z|journal=Neuroinformatics|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=393–403|doi=10.1007/s12021-013-9188-z|issn=1539-2791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://bigneuron.org BigNeuron project (http://bigneuron.org)] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peng |first=Hanchuan |last2= Hawrylycz |first2=Michael |last3= Roskams |first3=Jane |title= BigNeuron: Large-Scale 3D Neuron Reconstruction from Optical Microscopy Images|url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(15)00599-1|journal=Neuron|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=252–256|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.06.036 |pmid=26182412 |pmc=4725298}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a recent substantial international collaboration effort to integrate the majority of known neuron tracing tools onto a common platform to facilitate Open Source, easy accessing of various tools at one single place. Powerful new tools such as UltraTracer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Peng|first=Hanchuan|last2=Zhou|first2=Zhi|last3=Meijering|first3=Erik|date=2016|title=Automatic Tracing of Ultra-Volume of Neuronal Images|biorxiv=087726}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can trace arbitrarily large image volume, have been produced through this effort.

===Neuron formats and databases===
Reconstructions of single neurons can be stored in various formats. This largely depends on the software that have been used to trace such neurons. The SWC format, which consists of a number of topologically connected structural compartments (e.g. a single tube or sphere), is often used to store digital traced neurons, especially when the morphology lacks or does not need detailed 3D shape models for individual compartments. Other more sophisticated neuron formats have separate geometrical modeling of the neuron cell body and neuron processes using Neurolucida &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=Serena|last2=Stimpson|first2=Cheryl D.|last3=Bauernfeind|first3=Amy L.|last4=Schapiro|first4=Steven J.|last5=Baze|first5=Wallace B.|last6=McArthur|first6=Mark J.|last7=Bronson|first7=Ellen|last8=Hopkins|first8=William D.|last9=Semendeferi|first9=Katerina|date=2013-10-01|title=Dendritic Morphology of Pyramidal Neurons in the Chimpanzee Neocortex: Regional Specializations and Comparison to Humans|journal=Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|volume=23|issue=10|pages=2429–2436|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs239|issn=1047-3211|pmc=3767963|pmid=22875862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silberberg|first=Gilad|last2=Markram|first2=Henry|date=2007-03-01|title=Disynaptic Inhibition between Neocortical Pyramidal Cells Mediated by Martinotti Cells|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0896627307001110/abstract|journal=Neuron|language=English|volume=53|issue=5|pages=735–746|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.02.012|issn=0896-6273|pmid= 17329212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=Serena|last2=Bauernfeind|first2=Amy L.|last3=Gupta|first3=Kanika|last4=Stimpson|first4=Cheryl D.|last5=Spocter|first5=Muhammad A.|last6=Bonar|first6=Christopher J.|last7=Manger|first7=Paul R.|last8=Hof|first8=Patrick R.|last9=Jacobs|first9=Bob|date=2011-04-01|title=Neocortical neuron morphology in Afrotheria: comparing the rock hyrax with the African elephant|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1225|pages=37–46|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05991.x|issn=1749-6632|pmid=21534991}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Nightcart.gif|thumb|right|18th-century London nightman's calling card]]

'''Night soil''' is a historically used [[euphemism]] for [[Human waste|human excreta]] collected from [[cesspit|cesspools]], privies, [[pail closet]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, [[privy midden]]s, [[septic tank]]s, etc. This material was removed from the immediate area, usually at night, by workers employed in this trade. Sometimes it could be transported out of towns and sold on as a [[fertilizer]]. 

Another definition is "untreated excreta transported without water (e.g. via containers or buckets)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanitation safety planning: manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta.|author = Jackson, D| author2=Winkler, M| author3=Stenström, TA|publisher = World Health Organization|date=2015|isbn = 978 92 4 154924 0|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssp-manual/en/|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "night soil" is largely an [[Archaism|archaic word]], used in historical contexts. The modern term is "fecal sludge"; [[fecal sludge management]] is an ongoing challenge, particularly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/TILLEY%20et%20al%202014%20Compendium%20of%20Sanitation%20Systems%20and%20Technologies%20-%202nd%20Revised%20Edition.pdf|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|edition = 2nd Revised|author = Tilley, E.|author2 = Ulrich, L.|author3 = Lüthi, C.|author4 = Reymond, Ph.|author5 = Zurbrügg, C.|date=2014|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night soil was produced as a result of a [[sanitation]] system in areas without [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] or [[septic tank]]s. In this system of waste management, the human feces are collected without dilution with water.

==Collection and disposal==
{{Main|Fecal sludge management}}
Feces were excreted into a container such as a [[chamber pot]], and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence [[slopping out]]). The excrement in the pail was often covered with earth (soil), which may have contributed to the term "night soil." Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a [[shophouse]]. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Disposal has varied through time. In urban areas, a night soil collector arrived regularly, at varying time periods depending on the supply and demand for night soil collection. Usually this occurred during the night, giving the night soil its name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In isolated rural areas such as in [[farm]]s, the [[household]] usually disposed of the night soil themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Uses in agriculture==
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Human excreta may be attractive as [[fertilizer]] because of the high demand for fertilizer and the relative availability of the material to create night soil. In areas where native soil is of poor quality, the local population may weigh the risk of using night soil.

The use of unprocessed human feces as fertilizer is a risky practice as it may contain [[Faecal-oral route|disease-causing pathogens]]. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common [[parasitic worm]] infections, such as [[ascariasis]], in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted from one infected person to another person ([[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] of disease).

These risks are reduced by proper [[fecal sludge management]], e.g. via [[compost]]ing. The safe reduction of [[human excreta]] into compost is possible. Some municipalities create [[compost]] from the [[sewage sludge]], but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claims have been made that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of [[heavy metals]].

==History==

===Ancient Attica===
The use of sewage as fertilizer was common in ancient Attica. The sewage system of ancient Athens collected the sewage of the city in a large reservoir and then channelled it to the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus river]] valley for use as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Life of Greece'', PP. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===China, Hong Kong, and Singapore===
[[File:China; a woman carrying buckets of night-soil. Wellcome L0056427.jpg|thumb|A woman carrying buckets of night-soil, photographed in 1871.]]
The term is known, or even infamous, among the generations that were born in parts of China or [[Chinatowns]] (depending on the development of the infrastructure) before 1960. Post-[[World War II]] [[Chinatown, Singapore]], before the [[history of Singapore|independence of Singapore]], utilized night-soil collection as a primary means of waste disposal, especially as much of the infrastructure was damaged and took a long time to rebuild following the [[Battle of Singapore]] and subsequent [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Following the development of the economy and the [[standard of living]] after independence, the night soil system in Singapore is now merely a curious anecdote from the time of colonial rule when new systems developed.

The collection method is generally very manual and heavily relies on close human contact with the waste. During the Nationalist era when the [[Kuomintang]] ruled [[mainland China]], as well as Chinatown in Singapore, the night soil collector usually arrived with spare and relatively empty [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s to exchange for the full honey buckets. The method of transporting the honey buckets from individual households to collection centers was very similar to delivering [[water supply|water supplies]] by an unskilled laborer, with the exception that the item being transported was not at all [[drinking water|potable]]  and it was being delivered ''from'' the household, rather than ''to'' the household. The collector would hang full honey buckets onto each end of a pole he carried on his shoulder and then proceeded to carry it through the streets until he reached the collection point.

Hong Kong has a similar euphemism for night soil collection, {{lang|zh|倒夜香}} ''dàoyèxiāng'', which literally means "emptying nocturnal fragrance".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

{{see also|Toilets in Japan}}
The reuse of [[Human feces|feces]] as fertilizer was common in Japan. In [[Edo]] city, compost merchants gathered feces to sell for farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. [[Human waste|Human excreta]] of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, P., Walthall. A., &amp; Palias, J. (2006). Modern east asia: A cultural, social, &amp; political history. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston &amp; New York. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after [[World War II]], both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is used for night soil fertilization{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. The presence of the [[Occupation of Japan|United States occupying force]], by whom the use of human waste as fertilizer was seen as unhygienic and suspect, was also a contributing factor: "the Occupationaires condemned the practice, and tried to prevent their compatriots from eating vegetables and fruit from the local markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|title=Pictures|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=4 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615140135/http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|archivedate=15 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico and Central America===
Various [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations used human feces to fertilize their crops. The Aztecs, in particular, are well known for their famous [[chinampa]]s, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] in the year 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico."

A [[gong farmer]] was the term used in Tudor England for a person employed to remove human excrement from privies and cesspits.  Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries.

The rapid industrialisation of England during the nineteenth century led to mass urbanisation, over-crowding, and epidemics. One response was the development of the "Rochdale system", in which the town council arranged for the collection of the night soil from the outhouse attached to each dwelling or group of dwellings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calow|first1=Dennis|title=Home Sweet Home: A century of Leicester housing 1814-1914|date=2007|publisher=Univ of Leicester|url=http://cdm15407.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15407coll5/id/1181|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[pail closet]]). A later response was the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]], which led to the creation of [[Byelaw terraced house|byelaws regarding housing]], mandating one outhouse per house. These were still "earth closets" (not water closets i.e. WCs) and so still depended on the "night soil men" or "nightmen".

== Current examples ==

===India===
People responsible for the disposal of night soil are considered [[Dalit|untouchables]] in India. The practice of untouchability was banned by law when India gained independence, but the tradition widely persists as the law is difficult to enforce.  This "[[manual scavenging]]" is now illegal in all Indian states.

The Indian government's Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment stated in 2003 that 676,000 people were employed in the manual collection of human waste in India. Social organizations have estimated that up to 1.3 million Indians collect such waste. Further, workers in the collection of human waste were confined to marriage amongst themselves, thereby leading to a waste-collecting caste, which passes its profession on from generation to generation.

Employment of Manual Scavengers and Creation of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 has made manual scavenging illegal.

=== Japan ===
Modern Japan still has areas with ongoing night soil collection and disposal. The Japanese name for the "outhouse within the house" style toilet, where night soil is collected for disposal, is ''kumitori benjo'' (汲み取り便所). The proper disposal or [[recycling]] of sewage remains an important research area that is highly political.

[[Bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[insects]], [[earthworms]], [[Hemiptera|bugs]], and other creatures dig and digest the compost into fertile soil. The minerals and nutrients in the soil is recycled back into the production of crops.

A '''nutrient cycle''' (or '''ecological recycling''') is the movement and exchange of [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] matter back into the [[Productivity (ecology)|production]] of matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of [[mineral nutrients]] is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the [[carbon cycle]], [[sulfur cycle]], [[nitrogen cycle]], [[water cycle]], [[phosphorus cycle]], [[oxygen cycle]], among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into [[Productivity (ecology)|productive]] ecological nutrition.

[[File:Nutrient cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem.]]

There is much overlap between the terms for the [[biogeochemical cycle]] and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms.&lt;ref name="Levin09"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Simon A|last2=Carpenter|first2=Stephen R|last3=Godfray|first3=Charles J|last4=Kinzig|first4=Ann P|last5=Loreau|first5=Michel|last6=Losos|first6=Jonathan B|last7=Walker|first7=Brian|last8=Wilcove|first8=David S|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|date=27 July 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MS-vfT89QMC&amp;pg=PA330 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs.&lt;ref name="Bormann67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bormann | first1=F.

Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by [[Howard T. Odum]] when he penned that "it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy"&lt;ref name="Odum91"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=H.

Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of [[biomass]] exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources).

A large fraction of the elements composing living matter reside at any instant of time in the world’s biota. Because the earthly pool of these elements is limited and the rates of exchange among the various components of the biota are extremely fast with respect to geological time, it is quite evident that much of the same material is being incorporated again and again into different biological forms.

The persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as [[niche construction]] or ecosystem engineering. Many species leave an effect even after their death, such as coral skeletons or the extensive habitat modifications to a wetland by a beaver, whose components are recycled and re-used by descendants and other species living under a different selective regime through the feedback and agency of these legacy effects.&lt;ref name="Laland06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Laland | first1=K. | last2=Sterelny | first2=K. | title=Perspective: Several reasons (not) to neglect niche construction | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb00520.x | journal=Evolution | volume=60 | issue=9 | pages=1751–1762 | year=2006 | url=http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819190949/http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf | archivedate=2011-08-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hastings | first1=A. | last2=Byers | first2=J.

[[Earthworms]], for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil as they crawl about ([[bioturbation]]), digest on the [[Mold|molds]] of organic matter they pull from the [[soil litter]]. These activities transport nutrients into the [[soil|mineral layers of soil]]. Worms discard wastes that create [[worm castings]] containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process.&lt;ref name="Barot06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barot | first1=S. | last2=Ugolini | first2=A. | last3=Brikci | first3=F.

==History==
Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of [[Charles Darwin]] in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about "the continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] in 1687.

===Variations in terminology===
In 1926 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] coined the term '''[[biogeochemistry]]''' as a sub-discipline of [[geochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Gorham91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gorham | first1=E. | title=Biogeochemistry: Its origins and development | journal=Biogeochemistry | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=199–239 | year=1991 | url=http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00002942}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term '''nutrient cycle''' pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: "These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic ''nutrient cycle'' for the standing timber.&lt;ref name="Silvilculture99"&gt;{{citation | title=Pamphlets on silviculture | volume=41 | year=1899 | publisher=The University of California | url=https://books.google.com/?id=2oc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22nutrient+cycle%22&amp;dq=%22nutrient+cycle%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} In 1898 there is a reference to the '''nitrogen cycle''' in relation to [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="RBGKew98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer on behalf of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | title=The advances made in agricultural chemistry during the last twenty-five years | journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew) | volume=1898 | issue=144 | pages=326–331 | year=1898 | jstor=4120250 | doi=10.2307/4120250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history:

*The term '''mineral cycle''' appears early in a 1935 in reference to the importance of minerals in [[plant physiology]]: "...ash is probably either built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the ''mineral cycle''."&lt;ref name="Penston35"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penston | first=N.

*The term '''nutrient recycling''' appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology of the wood stork: "While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community, the fluctuating water levels favor rapid ''nutrient recycling'' and subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production"&lt;ref name="Kahl64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kahl | first1=M.

*The term '''natural cycling''' appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries management: "Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a factor in ''natural cycling'' of chemical elements and in degradation of the land."&lt;ref name="Slack68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slack | first1=K.

*The term '''ecological recycling''' appears in a 1968 publication on future applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: "For our basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much more frequent ''ecological recycling'' than the land area. Fish and other organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less capricious weather problems for sea harvesting."&lt;ref name="McHale68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McHale | first1=J. | title=Toward the future | journal=Design Quarterly | volume=72 | issue=72 | pages=3–31 | year=1968 | jstor=4047350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The term '''bio-recycling''' appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of organic carbon in oceans: "Following the actualistic assumption, then, that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which prevent its ''bio-recycling'', we can see no major difference in the behavior of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic oceans."&lt;ref name="Nissenbaum76"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nissenbaum | first1=A. | title=Scavenging of soluble organic matter from the prebiotic oceans | journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=413–416 | doi=10.1007/BF00927936 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l37x7632v6767192/ | bibcode=1976OrLi....7..413N| year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Larsson10" /&gt;

===Technological recycling===
{{main|Recycling}}

[[Recycling|Recycling in human industrial systems]] (or [[technoecosystem]]s) differs from ecological recycling in scale, complexity, and organization. Industrial recycling systems do not focus on the employment of ecological food webs to recycle waste back into different kinds of marketable goods, but primarily employ people and [[technodiversity]] instead. Some researchers have questioned the premise behind these and other kinds of technological solutions under the banner of 'eco-efficiency' are limited in their capability, harmful to ecological processes, and dangerous in their hyped capabilities.&lt;ref name="Huesemann03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rees09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rees | first1=W.

'''Order-independent transparency''' (OIT) is a class of techniques in [[rasterization|rasterisational]] [[computer graphics]] for rendering [[Transparency (graphic)|transparency]] in a 3D scene, which do not require rendering geometry in sorted order for [[alpha compositing]].

==Description==
Commonly, 3D geometry with transparency is rendered by blending (using [[alpha compositing]]) all surfaces into a single buffer (think of this as a canvas). Each surface occludes existing color and adds some of its own color depending on its ''alpha'' value, a ratio of light ''transmittance''. The order in which surfaces are blended affects the total occlusion or ''visibility'' of each surface. For a correct result, surfaces must be blended from farthest to nearest or nearest to farthest, depending on the [[alpha compositing]] operation, ''over'' or ''under''.
Ordering may be achieved by rendering the geometry in sorted order, for example sorting triangles by depth, but can take a significant amount of time,
not always produce a solution (in the case of intersecting or circularly overlapping geometry) and the implementation is complex.
Instead, order-independent transparency sorts geometry per-pixel, after rasterisation. For exact results this requires storing all [[Fragment (computer graphics)|fragments]] before sorting and compositing.

==History==
The A-Buffer&lt;ref&gt;Loren Carpenter. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808585 "The A-buffer, an Antialiased Hidden Surface Method"], SIGGRAPH '84 Proceedings of the 11th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques
Pages 103-108, July, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; is a computer graphics technique introduced in 1984 which stores per-pixel lists of fragment data (including [[Micropolygon|micro-polygon]] information) in a software rasteriser, [[Reyes rendering|REYES]], originally designed for [[anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing]] but also supporting transparency.

More recently, [[depth peeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://developer.nvidia.com/content/interactive-order-independent-transparency | title=Interactive Order-Independent Transparency | date=2001-05-15 | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Cass | last=Everitt | accessdate=2008-10-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927071951/http://developer.nvidia.com/content/interactive-order-independent-transparency | archivedate=2011-09-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 described a hardware accelerated OIT technique. With limitations in graphics hardware the scene's geometry had to be rendered many times. A number of techniques have followed, to improve on the performance of depth peeling, still with the many-pass rendering limitation. For example, Dual Depth Peeling (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/src/dual_depth_peeling/doc/DualDepthPeeling.pdf | title=Order Independent Transparency with Dual Depth Peeling | date=February 2008 | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Louis | last=Bavoil | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two significant features were introduced in GPU hardware/drivers/Graphics APIs that allowed capturing and
storing fragment data in a single rendering pass of the scene, something not previously possible.
These are, the ability to write to arbitrary GPU memory from shaders and atomic operations. With these features a new class
of OIT techniques became possible that do not require many rendering passes of the scene's geometry.
* The first was storing the fragment data in a 3D array,&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liu, Meng-Cheng Huang, Xue-Hui Liu, and En-Hua Wu. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1598069 "Single pass depth peeling via CUDA rasterizer"], In SIGGRAPH 2009: Talks (SIGGRAPH '09), 2009&lt;/ref&gt; where fragments are stored along the ''z'' dimension for each pixel ''x/y''. In practice, most of the 3D array is unused or overflows, as a scene's [[Depth Complexit (computer graphics)|depth complexity]] is typically uneven. To avoid overflow the 3D array requires large amounts of memory, which in many cases is impractical.
* Two approaches to reducing this memory overhead exist.
*# Packing the 3D array with a prefix sum scan, or ''linearizing'',&lt;ref&gt;Craig Peeper. [http://www.google.com/patents/US20080316214 "Prefix sum pass to linearize A-buffer storage"], Patent application, Dec, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; removed the unused memory issue but requires an additional [[Depth Complexit (computer graphics)|depth complexity]] computation rendering pass of the geometry. The ''"Sparsity-aware"'' S-Buffer, Dynamic Fragment Buffer,&lt;ref&gt;Marilena Maule and João L.D. Comba and Rafael Torchelsen and Rui Bastos. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420198 "Memory-optimized order-independent transparency with Dynamic Fragment Buffer "], In Computers &amp; Graphics, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"deque"'' D-Buffer{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}, Linearized Layered Fragment Buffer&lt;ref name="lfb"&gt;Pyarelal Knowles, Geoff Leach and Fabio Zambetta. [http://openglinsights.com/ "Chapter 20: Efficient Layered Fragment Buffer Techniques"], OpenGL Insights, pages 279-292, Editors Cozzi and Riccio, CRC Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; all pack fragment data with a prefix sum scan and are demonstrated with OIT.
*# Storing fragments in per-pixel linked lists&lt;ref&gt;Jason C. Yang, Justin Hensley, Holger Grün, and Nicolas Thibieroz. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2383624 "Real-time concurrent linked list construction on the GPU"], In Proceedings of the 21st Eurographics conference on Rendering (EGSR'10), 2010&lt;/ref&gt; provides tight packing of this data and in late 2011, driver improvements reduced the atomic operation contention overhead making the technique very competitive.&lt;ref name="lfb" /&gt;

==Exact OIT==
Exact, as opposed to [[#Approximate OIT|approximate]], OIT accurately computes the final color, for which all fragments must be sorted. For high depth complexity scenes, sorting becomes the bottleneck.

One issue with the sorting stage is local memory limited ''occupancy'', in this case a [[Single Instruction Multiple Threads|SIMT]] attribute relating to the throughput and operation latency hiding of GPUs. ''Backwards memory allocation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/bma-preprint.pdf | title=Backwards Memory Allocation and Improved OIT | date=Oct 2013 | publisher=[[Eurographics Digital Library]] | last=Knowles Et. Al. | accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BMA) groups pixels by their depth complexity and sorts them in batches to improve the occupancy and hence performance of low depth complexity pixels in the context of a potentially high depth complexity scene. Up to a 3× overall OIT performance increase is reported.

Sorting is typically performed in a local array, however performance can be improved further by making use of the GPU's memory hierarchy and sorting in registers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/rbs-preprint.pdf | title=Fast Sorting for Exact OIT of Complex Scenes | date=June 2014 | publisher=[[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]] | last=Knowles Et. Al. | accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly to an [[External sorting#External merge sort|external merge sort]], especially in conjunction with BMA.

==Approximate OIT==
Approximate OIT techniques relax the constraint of exact rendering to provide faster results.
Higher performance can be gained from not having to store all fragments or only partially sorting the geometry.
A number of techniques also compress, or ''reduce'', the fragment data.
These include:
* Stochastic Transparency: draw in a higher resolution in full opacity but discard some fragments. Downsampling will then yield transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~d00sint/StochasticTransparency_I3D2010.pdf | title=Stochastic Transparency | date=n.d. | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Eric | last=Enderton | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adaptive Transparency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/adaptive-transparency-hpg-2011 | title=Adaptive Transparency | date=2013-07-18 | last=Salvi Et. Al. | accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-pass technique where the first constructs a visibility function which compresses on the fly (this compression avoids having to fully sort the fragments) and the second uses this data to composite unordered fragments. Intel's ''pixel synchronization''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | 
url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/07/18/order-independent-transparency-approximation-with-pixel-synchronization | title=Order-Independent Transparency Approximation with Pixel Synchronization | date=2013-07-18 | publisher=[[Intel]] | first=Leigh | last=Davies | accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoids the need to store all fragments, removing the unbounded memory requirement of many other OIT techniques.

==OIT in Hardware==
* The Sega [[Dreamcast]] games console included hardware support for automatic OIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms834190.aspx | title=Optimizing Dreamcast Microsoft Direct3D Performance | date=1999-03-01 | publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planets and atmospheres==
A [[planet]] can be stripped of its atmosphere (or parts of the atmosphere) due to high energy [[photon]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]]. If a photon interacts with an atmospheric molecule, the molecule is accelerated and its temperature increased. If sufficient energy is provided, the molecule or atom may reach the [[escape velocity]] of the planet and "evaporate" into space. The lower the [[mass number]] of the gas, the higher the velocity obtained by interaction with a photon. Thus [[hydrogen]] is the gas which is most prone to photoevaporation.

==Protoplanetary disks==
[[Image:Sig06-023.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Photoevaporation occurring to a protoplanetary disk due to the presence of a nearby O-type star]]
[[Protoplanetary disk]]s can be dispersed by [[stellar wind]] and heating due to incident electromagnetic radiation. The radiation interacts with matter and thus accelerates it outwards. This effect is only noticeable when there is sufficient radiation strength, such as coming from nearby O and B type stars or when the central [[protostar]] commences [[nuclear fusion]].

The disk is composed of gas and dust. The gas, consisting mostly of light elements such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], is mainly affected by the effect, causing the ratio between dust and gas to increase.

Radiation from the central star excites particles in the accretion disk. The irradiation of the disk gives rise to a stability length scale known as the gravitational radius (&lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;). Outside of the gravitational radius, particles can become sufficiently excited to escape
the gravity of the disk, and evaporate. After 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years, 
the viscous accretion rates fall below the photoevaporation rates at &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;. 
A gap then opens around &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;, the inner disk drains onto the central star, 
or spreads to &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt; and evaporates. An inner hole extending to &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt; 
is produced. Once an inner hole forms, the outer disk is very rapidly cleared.

The formula for the gravitational radius of the disk is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2003PASA...20..337L|title=The Gravitational Radius of an Irradiated Disk|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=20|issue=4|pages=337|author1=Liffman|first1=Kurt|year=2003|doi=10.1071/AS03019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt; r_g = \frac{\left(\gamma - 1\right)}{2\gamma}\frac{GM\mu}{k_B T}
\approx 2.15 \frac{\left(M/M_\odot\right)}{\left(T/10^4 \ {\rm K} \right)} \ {\rm AU},\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of specific heats (= 5/3 for a monatomic gas),   &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the universal [[gravitational constant]],  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the central star, &lt;math&gt;M_\odot&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the Sun,
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the mean weight of the gas, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; [[Boltzmann constant]],
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the gas and AU the [[Astronomical Unit]].

Because of this effect, the presence of massive stars in a star-forming region is thought to have a great effect on planet formation from the disk around a [[young stellar object]], though it is not yet clear if this effect decelerates or accelerates it.

'''Physics beyond the Standard Model''' ('''BSM''') refers to the theoretical developments needed to explain the deficiencies of the [[Standard Model]], such as the [[origin of mass]], the [[strong CP problem]], [[neutrino oscillation]]s, [[baryon asymmetry|matter–antimatter asymmetry]], and the nature of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=sym-v2-feb-05&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem lies within the [[Quantum field theory|mathematical framework]] of the Standard Model itself: the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of [[general relativity]], to the point where one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known [[spacetime]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] like the [[Big Bang]] and [[black hole]] [[event horizons]]).

Theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through [[supersymmetry]], such as the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) and [[Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as [[string theory]], [[M-theory]], and [[extra dimensions]]. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the "best step" towards a [[Theory of Everything]], can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics]].

==Problems with the Standard Model==
Despite being the most successful theory of particle physics to date, the Standard Model is not perfect.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of "Beyond the Standard Model" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed.

===Phenomena not explained===
The Standard Model is inherently an incomplete theory.  There are fundamental physical phenomena in nature that the Standard Model does not adequately explain:
* ''[[Gravity]]''. The standard model does not explain gravity. The approach of simply adding a [[graviton]] to the Standard Model does not recreate what is observed experimentally without other modifications, as yet undiscovered, to the Standard Model. Moreover, instead, the Standard Model is widely considered to be incompatible with the most successful theory of gravity to date, [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |quote=One can find thousands of statements in the literature to the effect that “general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible”. These are completely outdated and no longer relevant. Effective field theory shows that general relativity and quantum mechanics work together perfectly normally over a range of scales and curvatures, including those relevant for the world that we see around us. However, effective field theories are only valid over some range of scales. General relativity certainly does have problematic issues at extreme scales. There are important problems which the effective field theory does not solve because they are beyond its range of validity. However, this means that the issue of quantum gravity is not what we thought it to be. Rather than a fundamental incompatibility of quantum mechanics and gravity, we are in the more familiar situation of needing a more complete theory beyond the range of their combined applicability. The usual marriage of general relativity and quantum mechanics is fine at ordinary energies, but we now seek to uncover the modifications that must be present in more extreme conditions. This is the modern view of the problem of quantum gravity, and it represents progress over the outdated view of the past."

* ''[[Dark matter]]''. Cosmological observations tell us the standard model explains about 5% of the energy present in the universe. About 26% should be dark matter,{{cn|date=September 2018}} which would behave just like other matter, but which only interacts weakly (if at all) with the Standard Model fields. Yet, the Standard Model does not supply any fundamental particles that are good dark matter candidates.
* ''[[Dark energy]]''. The remaining 69% of universe's energy should be so called dark energy, a constant energy density for the vacuum. Attempts to explain dark energy in terms of [[vacuum energy]] of the standard model lead to a mismatch of 120 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, L. (2009). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo ''A Universe from Nothing'']. AAI Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Neutrino]] masses''. According to the standard model, neutrinos are massless particles. However, [[neutrino oscillation]] experiments have shown that neutrinos do have mass. Mass terms for the neutrinos can be added to the standard model by hand, but these lead to new theoretical problems. For example, the mass terms need to be extraordinarily small and it is not clear if the neutrino masses would arise in the same way that the masses of other fundamental particles do in the Standard Model.
* ''[[Baryon asymmetry|Matter–antimatter asymmetry]]''. The universe is made out of mostly matter. However, the standard model predicts that matter and antimatter should have been created in (almost) equal amounts if the initial conditions of the universe did not involve disproportionate matter relative to antimatter. Yet, no mechanism sufficient to explain this asymmetry exists in the Standard Model.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==== Experimental results not explained ====
No experimental result is accepted as definitively contradicting the Standard Model at the five [[standard deviation|sigma]] level, widely considered to be the threshold of a discovery in particle physics. But because every experiment contains some degree of statistical and systemic uncertainty, and the theoretical predictions themselves are also almost never calculated exactly and are subject to uncertainties in measurements of the fundamental constants of the Standard Model (some of which are tiny and others of which are substantial), it is mathematically expected that some of the hundreds of experimental tests of the Standard Model will deviate to some extent from it, even if there were no new physics to be discovered.

At any given time there are a number of experimental results that are significantly different from the Standard Model expectation, although many of these have been found to be statistical flukes or experimental errors as more data has been collected. On the other hand, any physics beyond the Standard Model would necessarily first manifest experimentally as a statistically significant difference between an experiment and the theoretical prediction.

In each case, physicists seek to determine if a result is a mere statistical fluke or experimental error on the one hand, or a sign of new physics on the other. More statistically significant results cannot be mere statistical flukes but can still result from experimental error or inaccurate estimates of experimental precision. Frequently, experiments are tailored to be more sensitive to experimental results that would distinguish the Standard Model from theoretical alternatives.

Some of the most notable examples include the following:

* ''[[Proton radius puzzle]]'' – the Standard Model makes precise theoretical predictions regarding the atomic radius size of ordinary hydrogen (a proton-electron system) and that of muonic hydrogen (a proton-muon system in which a [[muon]] is behaving as a heavy variant of an electron). However, the measured atomic radius of muonic hydrogen differs significantly from that of the radius predicted by the Standard Model using existing physical constant measurements by what appears to be as many as seven standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Randolf Pohl |author2=Ronald Gilman |author3=Gerald A.

* ''[[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of muon'' – the experimentally measured value of muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (muon "g&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2") is significantly different from the Standard Model prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1311.2198|title=The Muon (g&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;2) Theory Value: Present and Future

* ''B meson decay etc.'' – results from a BaBar experiment may suggest a surplus over Standard Model predictions of a type of particle decay ({{nowrap|{{overline|B}} → D&lt;sup&gt;(*)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;τ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;{{overline|ν}}&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;}}). In this, an electron and positron collide, resulting in a [[B meson]] and an antimatter {{overline|B}} meson, which then decays into a [[D meson]] and a [[tau lepton]] as well as a [[tau antineutrino]]. While the level of certainty of the excess (3.4&amp;nbsp;sigma in statistical language) is not enough to claim a break from the Standard Model, the results are a potential sign of something amiss and are likely to affect existing theories, including those attempting to deduce the properties of Higgs bosons.&lt;ref name="BaBar Data Suggests Possible Flaws in the Standard Model June 18 19, 2012"&gt;

===Theoretical predictions not observed===
Observation at [[particle collider]]s of all of the fundamental particles predicted by the Standard Model has been confirmed.  The [[Higgs boson]] is predicted by the Standard Model's explanation of the [[Higgs mechanism]], which describes how the weak SU(2) gauge symmetry is broken and how fundamental particles obtain mass; it was the last particle predicted by the Standard Model to be observed. On July 4, 2012, [[CERN]] scientists using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] announced the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, with a mass of about {{val|126|ul=GeV/c2}}. A Higgs boson was confirmed to exist on March 14, 2013, although efforts to confirm that it has all of the properties predicted by the Standard Model are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;

A few [[hadron]]s (i.e. composite particles made of [[quark]]s) whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model, which can be produced only at very high energies in very low frequencies have not yet been definitively observed, and "[[glueball]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marco Frasca |title=What is a Glueball? |date=March 31, 2009 |url=http://marcofrasca.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/what-is-a-glueball-2/ |website=The Gauge Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. composite particles made of [[gluon]]s) have also not yet been definitively observed. Some very low frequency particle decays predicted by the Standard Model have also not yet been definitively observed because insufficient data is available to make a statistically significant observation.

===Theoretical problems===
Some features of the standard model are added in an [[ad hoc]] way. These are not problems per se (i.e. the theory works fine with these ad hoc features), but they imply a lack of understanding.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These ad hoc features have motivated theorists to look for more fundamental theories with fewer parameters. Some of the ad hoc features are:
* ''[[Hierarchy problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model introduces particle masses through a process known as [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] caused by the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] field. Within the standard model, the mass of the Higgs gets some very large quantum corrections due to the presence of [[virtual particle]]s (mostly virtual [[top quark]]s). These corrections are much larger than the actual mass of the Higgs. This means that the [[bare mass]] parameter of the Higgs in the standard model must be [[fine-tuning|fine tuned]] in such a way that almost completely cancels the quantum corrections.&lt;ref name="Hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/ |title=The Hierarchy Problem |website=Of Particular Significance |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This level of fine-tuning is deemed [[naturalness (physics)|unnatural]] by many theorists.{{who?|date=September 2018}}
* ''Number of parameters''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model depends on 19 numerical parameters. Their values are known from experiment, but the origin of the values is unknown. Some theorists{{who?|date=September 2018}} have tried to find relations between different parameters, for example, between the masses of particles in different [[generation (physics)|generations]].or calculating particle masses, such as in [[Physics_applications_of_asymptotically_safe_gravity#The_mass_of_the_Higgs_boson | asymptotic safety]] scenarios. {{cn|date=September 2018}}
* ''[[Quantum triviality]]''&amp;nbsp;– suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar Higgs particles.  This is sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=David J E Callaway | first=D. J.

* ''[[Strong CP problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– theoretically it can be argued that the standard model should contain a term that breaks [[CP symmetry]]—relating matter to [[antimatter]]—in the [[strong interaction]] sector. Experimentally, however, no such violation has been found, implying that the coefficient of this term is very close to zero.&lt;ref name= "Strong CP problem"&gt;{{cite conference | first = Thomas | last = Mannel | authorlink = | title = Theory and Phenomenology of CP Violation | booktitle = Nuclear Physics B, vol. 167 | volume = 167 | pages = 170–174 | publisher = Elsevier | conference = The 7th International Conference on Hyperons, Charm And Beauty Hadrons (BEACH 2006) | date = 2–8 July 2006 | location = Lancaster | url = https://indico.cern.ch/event/427023/session/6/contribution/43/attachments/912026/1288208/Lancester-Mannel-Proc.pdf

==Grand unified theories==
{{Main|Grand Unified Theory}}
The standard model has three [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]; the [[color charge|colour]] [[SU(3)]], the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]], and the [[weak hypercharge]] [[U(1)]] symmetry, corresponding to the three fundamental forces. Due to [[renormalization]] the coupling constants of each of these symmetries vary with the energy at which they are measured. Around {{val|e=16|u=GeV}} these couplings become approximately equal. This has led to speculation that above this energy the three gauge symmetries of the standard model are unified in one single gauge symmetry with a [[simple group]] gauge group, and just one coupling constant. Below this energy the symmetry is [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to the standard model symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

Theories that unify the standard model symmetries in this way are called [[Grand Unified Theories]] (or GUTs), and the energy scale at which the unified symmetry is broken is called the GUT scale. Generically, grand unified theories predict the creation of [[magnetic monopole]]s in the early universe,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these have been observed, and this absence of observation puts limits on the possible GUTs.

==Supersymmetry==
{{Main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of ''supersymmetric particles'', abbreviated as ''[[superpartner|sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by 1/2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s may not be powerful enough to produce them.

==Neutrinos==
In the standard model, [[neutrino]]s have exactly zero mass. This is a consequence of the standard model containing only [[chirality (physics)|left-handed]] neutrinos. With no suitable right-handed partner, it is impossible to add a renormalizable mass term to the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements however indicated that neutrinos [[neutrino oscillations|spontaneously change flavour]], which implies that neutrinos have a mass. These measurements only give the mass differences between the different flavours. The best constraint on the absolute mass of the neutrinos comes from precision measurements of [[tritium]] decay, providing an upper limit 2&amp;nbsp;eV, which makes them at least five orders of magnitude lighter than the other particles in the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

One approach to add masses to the neutrinos, the so-called [[seesaw mechanism]], is to add right-handed neutrinos and have these couple to left-handed neutrinos with a [[Dirac mass]] term. The right-handed neutrinos have to be [[sterile neutrino|sterile]], meaning that they do not participate in any of the standard model interactions. Because they have no charges, the right-handed neutrinos can act as their own anti-particles, and have a [[Majorana mass]] term. Like the other Dirac masses in the standard model, the neutrino Dirac mass is expected to be generated through the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore unpredictable. The standard model fermion masses differ by many orders of magnitude; the Dirac neutrino mass has at least the same uncertainty. On the other hand, the Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos does not arise from the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore expected to be tied to some energy scale of new physics beyond the standard model, for example the Planck scale.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any process involving right-handed neutrinos will be suppressed at low energies. The correction due to these suppressed processes effectively gives the left-handed neutrinos a mass that is inversely proportional to the right-handed Majorana mass, a mechanism known as the see-saw.&lt;ref name="TASI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of heavy right-handed neutrinos thereby explains both the small mass of the left-handed neutrinos and the absence of the right-handed neutrinos in observations.
However, due to the uncertainty in the Dirac neutrino masses, the right-handed neutrino masses can lie anywhere. For example, they could be as light as keV and be [[dark matter]],&lt;ref&gt;

The mass terms mix neutrinos of different generations. This mixing is parameterized by the [[PMNS matrix]], which is the neutrino analogue of the [[CKM matrix|CKM quark mixing matrix]]. Unlike the quark mixing, which is almost minimal, the mixing of the neutrinos appears to be almost maximal. This has led to various speculations of symmetries between the various generations that could explain the mixing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixing matrix could also contain several complex phases that break CP invariance, although there has been no experimental probe of these. These phases could potentially create a surplus of leptons over anti-leptons in the early universe, a process known as [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]. This asymmetry could then at a later stage be converted in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons, and explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.&lt;ref name="Buchmller" /&gt;

The light neutrinos are disfavored as an explanation for the observation of dark matter, due to considerations of large-scale structure formation in the early universe. Simulations of [[structure formation]] show that they are too hot—i.e. their kinetic energy is large compared to their mass—while formation of structures similar to the galaxies in our universe requires [[cold dark matter]]. The simulations show that neutrinos can at best explain a few percent of the missing dark matter. However, the heavy sterile right-handed neutrinos ''are'' a possible candidate for a dark matter [[weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Preon models==

Several [[preon]] models have been proposed to address the unsolved problem concerning the fact that there are three generations of quarks and leptons. Preon models generally postulate some additional new particles which are further postulated to be able to combine to form the quarks and leptons of the standard model. One of the earliest preon models was the [[Rishon model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harari |first=H. |year=1979 |title=A Schematic Model of Quarks and Leptons |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=83–86|bibcode = 1979PhLB...86...83H |doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(79)90626-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shupe |first=M.

To date, no preon model is widely accepted or fully verified.

==Theories of everything==

===Theory of everything===
{{Main|Theory of everything}}
Theoretical physics continues to strive toward a theory of everything, a theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of any experiment that could be carried out in principle.  In practical terms the immediate goal in this regard is to develop a theory which would unify the Standard Model with [[General Relativity]] in a theory of [[quantum gravity]].  Additional features, such as overcoming conceptual flaws in either theory or accurate prediction of particle masses, would be desired.
The challenges in putting together such a theory are not just conceptual - they include the experimental aspects of the very high energies needed to probe exotic realms.

Several notable attempts in this direction are [[supersymmetry]], string theory, and [[loop quantum gravity]].

===String theory===
{{Main|String theory}}
Extensions, revisions, replacements, and reorganizations of the Standard Model exist in attempt to correct for these and other issues. [[String theory]] is one such reinvention, and many theoretical physicists think that such theories are the next theoretical step toward a true [[Theory of Everything]]. Theories of [[quantum gravity]] such as [[loop quantum gravity]] and others are thought by some to be promising candidates to the mathematical unification of quantum field theory and general relativity, requiring less drastic changes to existing theories.&lt;ref&gt;

Among the numerous variants of string theory, [[M-theory]], whose mathematical existence was first proposed at a String Conference in 1995, is believed by many to be a proper [[Theory of Everything|"ToE"]] candidate, notably by physicists [[Brian Greene]] and [[Stephen Hawking]]. Though a full mathematical description is not yet known, solutions to the theory exist for specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], a '''prosthesis''' (plural: prostheses; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''prosthesis'', "addition, application, attachment"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pro/sqesis|πρόσθεσις|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or congenital conditions. Prosthetics are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part.&lt;ref name="madehow.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html|title=How artificial limb is made - material, manufacture, making, used, parts, components, structure, procedure|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosthetic [[amputation|amputee]] rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a prosthetist and an inter-disciplinary team of health care professionals including psychiatrists, surgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Prosthetics are commonly created with CAD (Computer-Aided Design), a software interface that helps creators visualize the creation in a 3D form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/alp/chap04-01.asp|title=4: Prosthetic Management: Overview, Methods, and Materials {{!}} O&amp;P Virtual Library|website=www.oandplibrary.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they can also be designed by hand.

==Types==
A person's prosthesis should be designed and assembled according to the person's appearance and functional needs. For instance, a person may need a transradial prosthesis, but need to choose between an aesthetic functional device, a myoelectric device, a body-powered device, or an activity specific device. The person's future goals and economical capabilities may help them choose between one or more devices.

[[Craniofacial prosthesis|Craniofacial prostheses]] include intra-oral and extra-oral prostheses. Extra-oral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial, auricular (ear), nasal, [[Orbital prosthesis|orbital]] and [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular]]. Intra-oral prostheses include [[dental prostheses]] such as [[dentures]], [[palatal obturator|obturators]], and [[dental implant]]s.

Prostheses of the neck include [[larynx]] [[Electrolarynx|substitutes]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and upper [[esophagus|esophageal]] replacements,

[[Somato prosthesis|Somato prostheses]] of the torso include [[breast prostheses]] which may be either single or bilateral, full breast devices or [[Nipple prosthesis|nipple prostheses]].

[[Penile prosthesis|Penile prostheses]] are used to treat erectile dysfunction.

===Limb prostheses===
[[File:A formation of Marines, firemen and policemen running across Manhattan in 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with bilateral prosthetic legs leads a formation run]]
[[Limb (anatomy)|Limb]] prostheses include both upper- and lower-extremity prostheses.

'''Upper-extremity prostheses''' are used at varying levels of amputation: forequarter, shoulder disarticulation, transhumeral prosthesis, elbow disarticulation, transradial prosthesis, wrist disarticulation, full hand, partial hand, finger, partial finger. A transradial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow.

Upper limb prostheses can be categorized in three main categories: Passive devices, Body Powered devices, Externally Powered (myoelectric) devices. Passive devices can either be passive hands, mainly used for cosmetic purpose, or passive tools, mainly used for specific activities (e.g. leisure or vocational). An extensive overview and classification of passive devices can be found in a literature review by Maat ''et.al.''&lt;ref name="Review Passive Prosthetic Hands"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maat|first1=Bartjan|last2=Smit|first2=Gerwin|last3=Plettenburg|first3=Dick|last4=Breedveld|first4=Paul|title=Passive prosthetic hands and tools: A literature review|journal=Prosthetics and Orthotics International|date=1 March 2017|doi=10.1177/0309364617691622|pmid=28190380|pmc=5810914|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=66–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A passive device can be static, meaning the device has no movable parts, or it can be adjustable, meaning its configuration can be adjusted (e.g. adjustable hand opening). Despite the absence of active grasping, passive devices are very useful in bimanual tasks that require fixation or support of an object, or for gesticulation in social interaction. According to scientific data a third of the upper limb amputees worldwide use a passive prosthetic hand.&lt;ref name="Review Passive Prosthetic Hands" /&gt; Body Powered or cable operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm. The third category of prosthetic devices available are [[myoelectric]] arms. These work by sensing, via [[electrode]]s, when the muscles in the [[Arm|upper arm]] move, causing an artificial hand to open or close. In the prosthetics industry, a trans-radial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a "BE" or below elbow prosthesis.

'''Lower-extremity prostheses''' provide replacements at varying levels of amputation. These include hip disarticulation, transfemoral prosthesis, knee disarticulation, transtibial prosthesis, Syme's amputation, foot, partial foot, and toe. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency).

A transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee. Transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement. In general, a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80% more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; This is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee. In newer and more improved designs, hydraulics, carbon fiber, mechanical linkages, motors, computer microprocessors, and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user. In the prosthetics industry a trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

A transtibial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee. A transtibial amputee is usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation, due in large part to retaining the knee, which allows for easier movement.  Lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. In the prosthetics industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis.

Physical therapists are trained to teach a person to walk with a leg prosthesis. To do so, the physical therapist may provide verbal instructions and may also help guide the person using touch, or tactile cues. This may be done in a clinic or home. There is some research suggesting that such training in the home may be more successful if the treatment includes the use of a treadmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Highsmith|first=M.

In the United Kingdom, 75% of lower limb amputations are performed due to inadequate [[Circulatory system|circulation]] (dysvascularity).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cumming|first=Jane|last2=Barr|first2=Steve|last3=Howe|first3=Tracey E.|date=2015-01-25|title=Prosthetic rehabilitation for older dysvascular people following a unilateral transfemoral amputation|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD005260|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005260.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25618482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350430|date = December 2018}} This condition is often associated with many other medical conditions ([[Comorbidity|co-morbidities]]) including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] that may make it a challenge to recover and use a prosthetic limb to regain mobility and independence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For people who have inadequate circulation and have lost a lower limb, there is insufficient evidence due to a lack of research, to inform them regarding their choice of prosthetic rehabilitation approaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An early mention of a prosthetic comes from the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who tells the story of [[Hegesistratus]], a Greek [[Divination|diviner]] who cut off his own foot to escape his [[Sparta]]n captors and replaced it with a wooden one.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories''. 9.37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood and metal hands ===
[[Pliny the Elder]] also recorded the tale of a Roman general, [[Marcus Sergius]], whose right hand was cut off while campaigning and had an [[Iron hand (prosthesis)|iron hand]] made to hold his shield so that he could return to battle. A famous and quite refined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karlofgermany.com/Goetz.htm |title=The Iron Hand of the Goetz von Berlichingen |publisher=Karlofgermany.com |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; historical prosthetic arm was that of [[Götz von Berlichingen]], made at the beginning of the 16th century.  The first confirmed use of a prosthetic device, however, is from 950–710 BC. In 2000, research pathologists discovered a mummy from this period buried in the Egyptian necropolis near ancient Thebes that possessed an artificial big toe.  This toe, consisting of wood and leather, exhibited evidence of use.  When reproduced by bio-mechanical engineers in 2011, researchers discovered that this ancient prosthetic enabled its wearer to walk both barefoot and in Egyptian style sandals.

During the Renaissance, prosthetics developed with the use of iron, steel, copper, and wood.

=== Technology progress before the 20th century ===
An Italian surgeon recorded the existence of an amputee who had an arm that allowed him to remove his hat, open his purse, and sign his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2660173|year=1989|author1=Romm|first1=S|title=Arms by design: From antiquity to the Renaissance|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=84|issue=1|pages=158–63|doi=10.1097/00006534-198907000-00029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvement in amputation surgery and prosthetic design came at the hands of [[Ambroise Paré]]. Among his inventions was an above-knee device that was a kneeling [[peg leg]] and foot prosthesis with a fixed position, adjustable harness, and knee lock control. The functionality of his advancements showed how future prosthetics could develop.

Other major improvements before the modern era:
* [[Pieter Verduyn]]&amp;nbsp;– First non-locking below-knee (BK) prosthesis.
* [[James Potts]]&amp;nbsp;– Prosthesis made of a wooden shank and socket, a steel knee joint and an articulated foot that was controlled by catgut tendons from the knee to the ankle. Came to be known as “Anglesey Leg” or “Selpho Leg”.
* Sir [[James Syme]]&amp;nbsp;– A new method of ankle amputation that did not involve amputating at the thigh.
* [[Benjamin Palmer]]&amp;nbsp;– Improved upon the Selpho leg. Added an anterior spring and concealed tendons to simulate natural-looking movement.
* [[Dubois Parmlee]]&amp;nbsp;– Created prosthetic with a suction socket, polycentric knee, and multi-articulated foot.
* [[Marcel Desoutter]] &amp; [[Charles Desoutter]]&amp;nbsp;– First aluminium prosthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/inmotion/nov_dec_07/history_prosthetics.html | work=inMotion: A Brief History of Prosthetics | title=A Brief History of Prosthetics| date=November–December 2007| accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henry Heather Bigg, and his son Henry Robert Heather Bigg, won the Queen's command to provide "surgical appliances" to wounded soldiers after Crimea War. They developed arms that allowed a double arm amputee to crochet, and a hand that felt natural to others based on ivory, felt, and leather.&lt;ref&gt;Bigg, Henry Robert Heather  (1885) [https://archive.org/details/b22293875 ''Artificial Limbs and the Amputations which Afford the Most Appropriate Stumps in Civil and Military Surgery'']. London&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) began to advocate better research and development of prosthetics. Through government funding, a research and development program was developed within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Veterans Administration.

===Lower extremity modern history===
Socket technology for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed the direction of Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended plug socket, created from wood.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf | title=Normal Shape-Normal Alignment (NSNA) Above-Knee Prosthesis | author=Long, Ivan A. | journal=Clin Prosthet Orthot | year=1985 | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.&lt;ref name="Gottschalk-Kourosh-Stills"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does Socket Configuration Influence the Position of the Femur in Above-Knee Amputation? |author1=Gottschalk, Frank A. |author2=Kourosh, Sohrab |author3=Stills, Melvin |author4=McClellan, Bruce |author5=Roberts, Jim | journal=Journal of Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics | year=1989 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=94–102 | doi=10.1097/00008526-198910000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was the first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A. Blatchford &amp; Sons, Ltd., of Great Britain, in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blatchford.co.uk/about/company-history/ “Blatchford Company History”], Blatchford Group.&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998. The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed. Cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated above-knee prosthesis will be about $1 million in 45 years, given only annual cost of living adjustments.&lt;ref name=PikeAlvin/&gt;

==Patient procedure==
A prosthesis is a functional replacement for an amputated or congenitally malformed or missing limb. Prosthetists are responsible for the prescription, design and management of a prosthetic device.

In most cases, the prosthetist begins by taking a plaster cast of the patient's affected limb. Lightweight, high-strength thermoplastics are custom-formed to this model of the patient. Cutting-edge materials such as carbon fiber, titanium and Kevlar provide strength and durability while making the new prosthesis lighter. More sophisticated prostheses are equipped with advanced electronics, providing additional stability and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progoandp.com/services/prosthetics/ |title=Custom Prosthetics, Artificial Limbs LI, NY &amp;#124; Progressive O&amp;P |publisher=Progoandp.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current technology and manufacturing==
[[File:WorkNC-Knee prosthesis.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Knee prosthesis manufactured using [[WorkNC]] [[Computer Aided Manufacturing]] software]]
Over the years, there have been advancements in artificial limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as [[carbon fiber]], have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This is especially important for trans-femoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to trans-radial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html |title=How artificial limb is made&amp;nbsp;– Background, Raw materials, The manufacturing process of artificial limb, Physical therapy, Quality control |publisher=Madehow.com |date=1988-04-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journal.pone.0019508.g004 prosthetic finger.png|left|thumb|Manufacturing a prosthetic finger]]
In addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. [[CAD/CAM|Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing]] are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sapphire"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mamalis |first1=AG |last2=Ramsden |first2=JJ |last3=Grabchenko |first3=AI |last4=Lytvynov |first4=LA |last5=Filipenko |first5=VA |last6=Lavrynenko |first6=SN |title=A novel concept for the manufacture of individual sapphire-metallic hip joint endoprostheses |journal=Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=113–117 |doi=10.4024/30601.jbpc.06.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern artificial limbs are attached to the residual limb (stump) of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by [[suction]]. The residual limb either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other residual limb shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the residual limb (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the residual limb. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the residual limb or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the residual limb, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser-guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.

One problem with the residual limb and socket attachment is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the residual limb and socket or liner, and increase pockets between residual limb skin and socket or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Over time, this can lead to breakdown of the skin.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/leg/default.htm |title=Getting an artificial leg up&amp;nbsp;– Cathy Johnson |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps:&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;
# Measurement of the residual limb
# Measurement of the body to determine the size required for the artificial limb
# Fitting of a silicone liner
# Creation of a model of the liner worn over the residual limb
# Formation of [[thermoplastic]] sheet around the model&amp;nbsp;– This is then used to test the fit of the prosthetic
# Formation of permanent socket
# Formation of plastic parts of the artificial limb&amp;nbsp;– Different methods are used, including [[vacuum forming]] and [[injection molding]]
# Creation of metal parts of the artificial limb using [[die casting]]
# Assembly of entire limb

===Body-powered arms===

Current technology allows body powered arms to weigh around one-half to one-third of what a myoelectric arm does.

====Sockets====
Current body-powered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or "interfaces" can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self-suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid-range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may require the use of a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.

====Wrists====
Wrist units are either screw-on connectors featuring the UNF 1/2-20 thread (USA) or quick-release connector, of which there are different models.

====Voluntary opening and voluntary closing====
Two types of body-powered systems exist, voluntary opening "pull to open" and voluntary closing "pull to close". Virtually all "split hook" prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system.

More modern "prehensors" called GRIPS utilize voluntary closing systems. The differences are significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force, while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force.

Voluntary closing users can generate prehension forces equivalent to the normal hand, upwards to or exceeding one hundred pounds. Voluntary closing GRIPS require constant tension to grip, like a human hand, and in that property, they do come closer to matching human hand performance. Voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below 20 pounds.

====Feedback====
An additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to "feel" what is being held. Voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm. No gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held. Voluntary closing systems provide directly [[Proportional Myoelectric Control|proportional control]] and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying.

A recent study showed that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information could be provided to an amputee. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 24500407 "&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raspopovic S1, Capogrosso M, Petrini FM| title = Restoring natural sensory feedback in real-time bidirectional hand prostheses. | journal = Sci.

Researchers from École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne in Switzerland and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Italy, implanted the electrodes into the amputee's arm in February 2013. The study, published Wednesday{{When|date=May 2015}} in ''Science Translational Medicine'', details the first time sensory feedback has been restored allowing an amputee to control an artificial limb in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/05/bionic-hand-amputee-feels/5229665/ "With a new prosthetic, researchers have managed to restore the sense of touch for a Denmark man who lost his left hand nine years ago."], ''USA Today'', February 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; With wires linked to nerves in his upper arm, the Danish patient was able to handle objects and instantly receive a sense of touch through the special artificial hand that was created by Silvestro Micera and researchers both in Switzerland and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/artificial-hand-offering/986332.html "Artificial hand offering immediate touch response a success"], ''Channelnewsasia'', February 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal devices====
Terminal devices contain a range of hooks, prehensors, hands or other devices.

=====Hooks=====
Voluntary opening split hook systems are simple, convenient, light, robust, versatile and relatively affordable.

A hook does not match a normal human hand for appearance or overall versatility, but its material tolerances can exceed and surpass the normal human hand for mechanical stress (one can even use a hook to slice open boxes or as a hammer whereas the same is not possible with a normal hand), for thermal stability (one can use a hook to grip items from boiling water, to turn meat on a grill, to hold a match until it has burned down completely) and for chemical hazards (as a metal hook withstands acids or lye, and does not react to solvents like a prosthetic glove or human skin).

=====Hands=====
[[File:Myoelectric prosthetic arm.jpg|right|thumb|Actor [[Owen Wilson]] gripping the myoelectric prosthetic arm of a United States Marine]]

Prosthetic hands are available in both voluntary opening and voluntary closing versions and because of their more complex mechanics and cosmetic glove covering require a relatively large activation force, which, depending on the type of harness used, may be uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Commercial providers and materials====
Hosmer and [[Otto Bock]] are major commercial hook providers. Mechanical hands are sold by Hosmer and Otto Bock as well; the Becker Hand is still manufactured by the Becker family. Prosthetic hands may be fitted with standard stock or custom-made cosmetic looking silicone gloves. But regular work gloves may be worn as well. Other terminal devices include the V2P Prehensor, a versatile robust gripper that allows customers to modify aspects of it, Texas Assist Devices (with a whole assortment of tools) and TRS that offers a range of terminal devices for sports. Cable harnesses can be built using aircraft steel cables, ball hinges, and self-lubricating cable sheaths. Some prosthetics have been designed specifically for use in salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Onken|first1=Sarah|title=Dive In|url=http://www.cityviewnc.com/2014/01/06/20010/dive-in|website=cityviewnc.com|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower-extremity prosthetics===
[[File:AustralianParalympianOfTheYear 468.JPG|thumb|right|A prosthetic leg worn by [[Ellie Cole]]]]
Lower-extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. Concerning all ages Ephraim et al. (2003) found a worldwide estimate of all-cause lower-extremity amputations of 2.0–5.9 per 10,000 inhabitants. For birth prevalence rates of congenital limb deficiency they found an estimate between 3.5–7.1 cases per 10,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12736892|year=2003|author1=Ephraim|first1=P. L.|title=Epidemiology of limb loss and congenital limb deficiency: A review of the literature|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=84|issue=5|pages=747–61|last2=Dillingham|first2=T. R.|last3=Sector|first3=M|last4=Pezzin|first4=L. E.|last5=MacKenzie|first5=E. J.|doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(02)04932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency), and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency). In the prosthetic industry, a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

Other, less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following:
# Hip disarticulations&amp;nbsp;– This usually refers to when an amputee or congenitally challenged patient has either an amputation or anomaly at or in close proximity to the hip joint.
# Knee disarticulations&amp;nbsp;– This usually refers to an amputation through the knee disarticulating the femur from the tibia.
# Symes&amp;nbsp;– This is an ankle disarticulation while preserving the heel pad.

====Socket====
The socket serves as an interface between the residuum and the prosthesis, ideally allowing comfortable weight-bearing, movement control and proprioception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11392649|year=2001|author1=Mak|first1=A.

This part creates distance and support between the knee-joint and the foot (in case of an upper-leg prosthesis) or between the socket and the foot. The type of connectors that are used between the shank and the knee/foot determines whether the prosthesis is modular or not. Modular means that the angle and the displacement of the foot in respect to the socket can be changed after fitting. In developing countries prosthesis mostly are non-modular, in order to reduce cost. When considering children modularity of angle and height is important because of their average growth of 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Foot====
Providing contact to the ground, the foot provides shock absorption and stability during stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00008526-200510001-00007|title=Perspectives on How and Why Feet are Prescribed|journal=JPO Journal of Prosthetics and Orthotics|volume=17|pages=S18|year=2005|last1=Stark|first1=Gerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally it influences gait biomechanics by its shape and stiffness. This is because the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP) and the angle of the ground reaction forces is determined by the shape and stiffness of the foot and needs to match the subject's build in order to produce a normal gait pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0966-6362(93)90038-3|title=Trajectory of the body COG and COP during initiation and termination of gait|journal=Gait &amp; Posture|volume=1|pages=9–22|year=1993|last1=Jian|first1=Yuancheng|last2=Winter|first2=DA|last3=Ishac|first3=MG|last4=Gilchrist|first4=L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrysek (2010) found 16 different types of feet, with greatly varying results concerning durability and biomechanics. The main problem found in current feet is durability, endurance ranging from 16–32 months &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21083505|year=2010|author1=Andrysek|first1=J|title=Lower-limb prosthetic technologies in the developing world: A review of literature from 1994–2010|journal=Prosthetics and Orthotics International|volume=34|issue=4|pages=378–98|doi=10.3109/03093646.2010.520060|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/03093646.2010.520060}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results are for adults and will probably be worse for children due to higher activity levels and scale effects. Evidence comparing different types of feet and ankle prosthetic devices is not strong enough to determine if one mechanism of ankle/foot is superior to another.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstad|first=C.|last2=Linde|first2=H.|last3=Limbeek|first3=J.|last4=Postema|first4=K.|date=2004|title=Prescription of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms after lower limb amputation|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=1|pages=CD003978|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003978.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=14974050|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deciding on a device, the cost of the device, a person's functional need, and the availability of a particular device should be considered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Knee joint====
In case of a trans-femoral amputation, there also is a need for a complex connector providing articulation, allowing flexion during swing-phase but not during stance.

=====Microprocessor control=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CLegProfile.jpg|frame|right|Two different models of microprocessor controlled knees (C-leg)]] --&gt;
To mimic the knee's functionality during gait, microprocessor-controlled knee joints have been developed that control the flexion of the knee. Some examples are [[Otto Bock]]’s C-leg, introduced in 1997, Ossur's Rheo Knee, released in 2005, the Power Knee by [[Ossur]], introduced in 2006, the Plié Knee from Freedom Innovations and DAW Industries’ Self Learning Knee (SLK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daw-usa.com/Pages/SLK3.html "The SLK, The Self-Learning Knee"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081600/http://www.daw-usa.com/Pages/SLK3.html# |date=2012-04-25 }}, DAW Industries. Retrieved 16 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was originally developed by Kelly James, a Canadian engineer, at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/20/health/menshealth/20marrbox.html |title = Titanium and Sensors Replace Ahab's Peg Leg |accessdate=2008-10-30 |work= The New York Times |date= 2005-06-20 | first=Michel | last=Marriott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microprocessor is used to interpret and analyze signals from knee-angle sensors and moment sensors. The microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee. Most microprocessor controlled knee-joints are powered by a battery housed inside the prosthesis.

The sensory signals computed by the microprocessor are used to control the resistance generated by [[hydraulic cylinders]] in the knee-joint. Small valves control the amount of [[hydraulic fluid]] that can pass into and out of the cylinder, thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee.&lt;ref name=PikeAlvin&gt;Pike, Alvin (May/June 1999). "The New High Tech Prostheses". InMotion Magazine 9 (3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of a microprocessor-controlled prosthesis is a closer approximation to an amputee's natural gait. Some allow amputees to walk near walking speed or run. Variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor, which adjusts to these changes accordingly. It also enables the amputees to walk downstairs with a step-over-step approach, rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees.&lt;ref name=MartinCraigW&gt;Martin, Craig W. (November 2003) [http://www.ibrarian.net/navon/paper/Evidence_Based_Practice_Group__EBPG_.pdf?paperid=2575568 "Otto Bock C-leg: A review of its effectiveness"]. WCB Evidence Based Group&lt;/ref&gt; There is some research suggesting that people with microprocessor-controlled prostheses report greater satisfaction and improvement in functionality, residual limb health, and safety.&lt;ref name="Kannenberg 2014 1469–1496"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kannenberg|first=Andreas|last2=Zacharias|first2=Britta|last3=Pröbsting|first3=Eva|date=2014|title=Benefits of microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees to limited community ambulators: systematic review|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|volume=51|issue=10|pages=1469–1496|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2014.05.0118|issn=1938-1352|pmid=25856664}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be able to perform everyday activities at greater speeds, even while multitasking, and reduce their risk of falls.&lt;ref name="Kannenberg 2014 1469–1496"/&gt;

However, some have some significant drawbacks that impair its use. They can be susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Myoelectric===
A '''myoelectric prosthesis''' uses the electrical tension generated every time a muscle contracts, as information. This tension can be captured from voluntarily contracted muscles by electrodes applied on the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuromuscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist, elbow or foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amputees control bionic legs with their thoughts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/20/us-iceland-mind-controlled-limb-idUSKBN0O51EQ20150520|publisher=Reuters|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of the prosthesis. There is no clear evidence concluding that myoelectric upper extremity prostheses function better than body-powered prostheses.&lt;ref name=Carey2015 /&gt; Advantages to using a myoelectric upper extremity prosthesis include the potential for improvement in cosmetic appeal (this type of prosthesis may have a more natural look), may be better for light everyday activities, and may be beneficial for people experiencing [[phantom limb]] pain.&lt;ref name=Carey2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Stephanie L.|last2=Lura|first2=Derek J.|last3=Highsmith|first3=M.

The USSR was the first to develop a myoelectric arm in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=365281|year=1978|author1=Wirta|first1=R.

Researchers at the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]] announced in September 2013 that they have developed a robotic leg that translates neural impulses from the user's thigh muscles into movement, which is the first prosthetic leg to do so. It is currently in testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2013/09/robotic-leg-emg.html |title=Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago First to Develop Thought Controlled Robotic Leg |publisher=Medgadget.com |date=September 2013 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robotic prostheses===

Robots can be used to generate objective measures of patient's impairment and therapy outcome, assist in diagnosis, customize therapies based on patient's motor abilities, and assure compliance with treatment regimens and maintain patient's records. It is shown in many studies that there is a significant improvement in upper limb motor function after stroke using robotics for upper limb rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinkensmeyer David J | year = 2009 | title = Robotic Assistance For Upper Extremity Training After Stroke | journal = Studies in Health Technology and Informatics | volume = 145 | issue =  | pages = 25–39 | pmid = 19592784 | url = http://computational.eu/emerging//book9/chapter_2.pdf | access-date = 2016-12-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228195545/http://computational.eu/emerging//book9/chapter_2.pdf# | archive-date = 2016-12-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work, it must have several components to integrate it into the body's function: [[Biosensors]] detect signals from the user's nervous or muscular systems. It then relays this information to a [[Controller (computing)|controller]] located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator, e.g., position or force, and sends it to the controller. Examples include surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. One type of these biosensors are employed in [[myoelectric prosthesis|myoelectric prostheses]].

A device known as the [[Controller (computing)|controller]] is connected to the user's nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.

An [[actuator]] mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a technique in which [[motor nerve]]s, which previously controlled [[muscle]]s on an amputated limb, are [[surgery|surgically]] rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large, intact muscle, such as the [[pectoralis major]]. As a result, when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of his missing hand, a small area of muscle on his chest will contract instead. By placing sensors over the reinnervated muscle, these contractions can be made to control the movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kuiken TA, Miller LA, Lipschutz RD, Lock BA, Stubblefield K, Marasco PD, Zhou P, Dumanian GA |title=Targeted reinnervation for enhanced prosthetic arm function in a woman with a proximal amputation: a case study |journal=Lancet |date= February 3, 2007 |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=371–80 |pmid=17276777 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22730/ |title=Blogs: TR Editors' blog: Patients Test an Advanced Prosthetic Arm |work=Technology Review |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR). This procedure is similar to TMR, except that [[sensory nerve]]s are surgically rerouted to [[skin]] on the chest, rather than motor nerves rerouted to muscle. Recently, robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from [[Human brain|the human brain]] and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb. [[DARPA]], the Pentagon's research division, is working to make even more advancements in this area. Their desire is to create an artificial limb that ties directly into the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/sn07-43.htm |title=Defense Sciences Office |publisher=Darpa.mil |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080528/http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/sn07-43.htm# |archive-date=2009-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robotic arms====
Advancements in the processors used in myoelectric arms have allowed developers to make gains in fine-tuned control of the prosthetic. The [[Boston Digital Arm]] is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the [[i-Limb hand]], invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by [[David Gow]] has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power, and key grip modes.

Another neural prosthetic is [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] [[Proto 1]]. Besides the Proto 1, the university also finished the [[Proto 2]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ric.org/aboutus/mediacenter/press/2007/o501.aspx |title=Proto 1 and Proto 2 |publisher=Ric.org |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215917/http://www.ric.org/aboutus/mediacenter/press/2007/o501.aspx# |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2013, Max Ortiz Catalan and Rickard Brånemark of the Chalmers University of Technology, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, succeeded in making the first robotic arm which is mind-controlled and can be permanently attached to the body (using [[osseointegration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130222075730.htm |title=World premiere of muscle and nerve controlled arm prosthesis |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=February 2013 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/thought-controlled-prosthetic-arm/25216/ |title=Mind-controlled permanently-attached prosthetic arm could revolutionize prosthetics |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2016-12-28 |author=Williams, Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Jason |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/sectors/medical-and-healthcare/news/trials-imminent-for-implantable-thought-controlled-robotic-arm/1014779.article |title=Trials imminent for implantable thought-controlled robotic arm |publisher=Theengineer.co.uk |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An approach that is very useful is called arm rotation which is common for unilateral amputees which is an amputation that affects only one side of the body; and also essential for bilateral amputees, a person who is missing or has had amputated either both arms or legs, to carry out activities of daily living. This involves inserting a small permanent magnet into the distal end of the residual bone of subjects with upper limb amputations. When a subject rotates the residual arm, the magnet will rotate with the residual bone, causing a change in magnetic field distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li, Guanglin |author2=Kuiken, Todd A | year = 2008 | title = Modeling of Prosthetic Limb Rotation Control by Sensing Rotation of Residual Arm Bone | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 2134–2142 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2008.923914| pmc=3038244 | pmid=18713682}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG (electroencephalogram) signals, detected using small flat metal discs attached to the scalp, essentially decoding human brain activity used for physical movement, is used to control the robotic limbs. This allows the user to control the part directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Contreras-Vidal José L. | year = 2012 | title = Restoration of Whole Body Movement: Toward a Noninvasive Brain-Machine Interface System | url = | journal = IEEE Pulse | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 34–37 | doi=10.1109/mpul.2011.2175635|display-authors=etal| pmc = 3357625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robotic legs====
The research of Robotic legs has made some advancement over time, allowing exact movement and control. A company in Switzerland called Ossur, has created a robotic leg that moves through algorithms and sensors that automatically adjust the angle of the foot during different points in its wearer's stride. Also there are brain-controlled bionic legs that allow an individual to move his limbs with a wireless transmitter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really|title=Brain-Controlled Bionic Legs Are Finally Here|work=Popular Science|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Prosthesis design=====
The main goal of a robotic prosthesis is to provide active actuation during gait to improve the biomechanics of gait, including, among other things, stability, symmetry, or energy expenditure for amputees. There are several powered prosthetic legs currently on the market, including fully powered legs, in which actuators directly drive the joints, and semi-active legs, which use small amounts of energy and a small actuator to change the mechanical properties of the leg but do not inject net positive energy into gait.  Specific examples include The emPOWER from BionX, the Proprio Foot from Ossur, and the Elan Foot from Endolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionxmed.com/|title=Home - BionX Medical Technologies|website=www.bionxmed.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ossur.com/prosthetic-solutions/products/dynamic-solutions/proprio-foot|title=PROPRIO FOOT|last=Össur|website=www.ossur.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.endolite.com/products/elan|title=Elan - Carbon, Feet, Hydraulic - Endolite USA - Lower Limb Prosthetics|work=Endolite USA - Lower Limb Prosthetics|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various research groups have also experimented with robotic legs over the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Windrich|first=Michael|last2=Grimmer|first2=Martin|last3=Christ|first3=Oliver|last4=Rinderknecht|first4=Stephan|last5=Beckerle|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-19|title=Active lower limb prosthetics: a systematic review of design issues and solutions|journal=BioMedical Engineering OnLine|volume=15|issue=3|pages=140|doi=10.1186/s12938-016-0284-9|pmid=28105948|pmc=5249019|issn=1475-925X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central issues being researched include designing the behavior of the device during stance and swing phases, recognizing the current ambulation task, and various mechanical design problems such as robustness, weight, battery-life/efficiency, and noise-level.

==Attachment to the body==
Most prostheses can be attached to the exterior of the body, in a non-permanent way. Some others however can be attached in a permanent way. One such example are exoprostheses (see below).

===Direct bone attachment and osseointegration===
{{Main|Osseointegration}}
[[Osseointegration]] is a method of attaching the artificial limb to the body. This method is also sometimes referred to as [[exoprosthesis]] (attaching an artificial limb to the bone), or endo-exoprosthesis.

The stump and socket method can cause significant pain in the amputee, which is why the direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump. After several months the [[osseointegration|bone attaches itself]] to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following:
* Better muscle control of the prosthetic.
* The ability to wear the prosthetic for an extended period of time; with the stump and socket method this is not possible.
* The ability for transfemoral amputees to drive a car.
The main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb, such as those experienced during jogging, because of the potential for the bone to break.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

==Cosmesis==
Cosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements. With advances in modern technology, [[cosmesis]], the creation of lifelike limbs made from [[silicone]] or [[PVC]] has been made possible. Such prosthetics, including artificial hands, can now be designed to simulate the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos.
Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of U.S. dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come premade in a variety of sizes, although they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.

==Cognition==
{{Main|Neuroprosthetics}}

Unlike neuromotor prostheses, neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as [[executive function]], [[attention]], language, and memory. No neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive brain-computer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[autism]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Serruya MD, Kahana MJ 2008 149"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= Behav Brain Res |year=2008 |title= Techniques and devices to restore cognition |vauthors=Serruya MD, Kahana MJ |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.04.007 |pmid=18539345 |volume= 192 |issue= 2|pages= 149–65|pmc= 3051349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recent field of [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15764275 Assistive Technology for Cognition] concerns the development of technologies to augment human cognition.  Scheduling devices such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20090413224808/http://www.neuropage.nhs.uk/default.asp?id= Neuropage] remind users with memory impairments when to perform certain activities, such as visiting the doctor.

In addition to the standard artificial limb for everyday use, many amputees or [[congenital]] patients have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities.

Within science fiction, and, more recently, within the [[scientific community]], there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function. The morality and desirability of such technologies are being debated by [[transhumanists]], other ethicists, and others in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/ht/enhancement/main |title=Enhancements, Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics |publisher=Practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228205218/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/ht/enhancement/main# |archive-date=2016-12-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010052 |pmid=15630464 |title=Is It Ethical to Use Enhancement Technologies to Make Us Better than Well? |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=e52 |year=2004 |last1=Caplan |first1=Arthur |last2=Elliott |first2=Carl |pmc=539045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587810.001.0001 |title=Beyond Humanity? |year=2011 |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen E. |isbn=9780199587810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2012.01964.x|title=Beyond Humanity?

The first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the British scientist [[Kevin Warwick]]. In 2002, an implant was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The [[electrode array]], which contained around a hundred [[electrode]]s, was placed in the [[median nerve]]. The signals produced were detailed enough that a [[robot arm]] was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant.&lt;ref name="Warwick, K 1373"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warwick K, Gasson M, Hutt B, Goodhew I, Kyberd P, Andrews B, Teddy P, Shad A | year = 2003 | title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems | url = | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 10| pages = 1369–1373 | doi=10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369 | pmid=14568806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscar Pistorius===
In early 2008, [[Oscar Pistorius]], the "Blade Runner" of South Africa, was briefly ruled ineligible to compete in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] because his transtibial prosthesis limbs were said to give him an unfair advantage over runners who had ankles. One researcher found that his limbs used twenty-five percent less energy than those of an able-bodied runner moving at the same speed.  This ruling was overturned on appeal, with the appellate court stating that the overall set of advantages and disadvantages of Pistorius' limbs had not been considered.

Pistorius did not qualify for the South African team for the Olympics, but went on to sweep the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], and has been ruled eligible to qualify for any future Olympics.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} He qualified for the 2011 World Championship in South Korea and reached the semifinal where he ended last timewise, he was 14th in the first round, his personal best at 400m would have given him 5th place in the finals. At the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, Pistorius became the first amputee runner to compete at an Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Klemko|title=Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/track/story/2012-08-10/4x400-relay-oscar-pistorius-south-afric/56946372/1|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69qCZG7ST?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/track/story/2012-08-10/4x400-relay-oscar-pistorius-south-afric/56946372/1|archivedate=11 August 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=10 August 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran in the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's 400 metres|400&amp;nbsp;metres race]] semifinals,&lt;ref name="BBC 20120804"&gt;{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400m at London 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18911479|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bill Chappell|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400 meters, and moves on to semifinal|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/08/04/158126486/oscar-pistorius-makes-olympic-history-in-400-meters-and-moves-on-to-semifinal|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69fiw3sEg?url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/08/04/158126486/oscar-pistorius-makes-olympic-history-in-400-meters-and-moves-on-to-semifinal|archivedate=4 August 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=4 August 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Men's 400m&amp;nbsp;– semifinals|url=http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event/men-400m/phase=atm004200/index.html|accessdate=4 August 2012|work=london2012.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's 4 × 400 metres relay|4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;400&amp;nbsp;metres relay race]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius, South African 4×400m relay team finish 8th as Bahamas wins gold|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/oscar-pistorius-south-africa-relay-4x400-olympics_n_1765596.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69qCxjdgj?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/oscar-pistorius-south-africa-relay-4x400-olympics_n_1765596.html|archivedate=11 August 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012|first=Chris|last=Greenberg|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also competed in 5 events in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hawking, Pistorius open London's Paralympics: Wheelchair-bound physicist Stephen Hawking challenged athletes to 'look to the stars' as he helped open a record-setting Paralympics Games that will run for 11 days in near sold-out venues|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/hawking-pistorius-open-londons-paralympics-194425194.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJGcTrlp?url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/hawking-pistorius-open-londons-paralympics-194425194.html|archivedate=30 August 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Design considerations==
There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.

===Performance===
Nonetheless, there are certain elements of socket and foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of today's high-tech prosthetics companies:
* Fit&amp;nbsp;– athletic/active amputees, or those with bony residua, may require a carefully detailed socket fit; less-active patients may be comfortable with a 'total contact' fit and gel liner
* Energy storage and return&amp;nbsp;– storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion
* Energy absorption&amp;nbsp;– minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system
* Ground compliance&amp;nbsp;– stability independent of terrain type and angle
* Rotation&amp;nbsp;– ease of changing direction
* Weight&amp;nbsp;– maximizing comfort, balance and speed
* Suspension&amp;nbsp;– how the socket will join and fit to the limb

===Other===
The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:
* Cosmetics
* Cost
* Ease of use
* Size availability

==Cost and source freedom==

===High-cost===
In the USA a typical prosthetic limb costs anywhere between $15,000 and $90,000, depending on the type of limb desired by the patient.  With medical insurance, a patient will typically pay 10%–50% of the total cost of a prosthetic limb, while the insurance company will cover the rest of the cost.  The percent that the patient pays varies on the type of insurance plan, as well as the limb requested by the patient.&lt;ref name="Cost of a Prosthetic Limb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost of a Prosthetic Limb|url=http://health.costhelper.com/prosthetic-legs.html|website=Cost Helper Health|accessdate= 13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, much of Europe, Australia and New Zealand the entire cost of prosthetic limbs is met by state funding or statutory insurance. For example, in Australia prostheses are fully funded by state schemes in the case of amputation due to disease, and by workers compensation or traffic injury insurance in the case of most traumatic amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for your prosthesis.|url=http://www.limbs4life.org.au/funding/funding-for-your-prosthesis|website=Limbs4life|publisher=Limbs4life|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which is being rolled out nationally between 2017 and 2020 also pays for prostheses.

Transradial (below the elbow amputation) and transtibial prostheses (below the knee amputation) typically cost between US [[United States dollar|$]]6,000 and $8,000, while transfemoral (above the knee amputation) and transhumeral prosthetics (above the elbow amputation) cost approximately twice as much with a range of $10,000 to $15,000 and can sometimes reach costs of $35,000. The cost of an artificial limb often recurs, while a limb typically needs to be replaced every 3–4 years due to [[wear and tear]] of everyday use.  In addition, if the socket has fit issues, the socket must be replaced within several months from the onset of pain. If height is an issue, components such as pylons can be changed.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/07/05/cost_of_prosthetics_stirs_debate/ "Cost of Prosthetics Stirs Debate"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 5 July 2005. Retrieved 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does the patient need to pay for their multiple prosthetic limbs, but they also need to pay for physical and occupational therapy that come along with adapting to living with an artificial limb.  Unlike the reoccurring cost of the prosthetic limbs, the patient will typically only pay the $2000 to $5000 for therapy during the first year or two of living as an amputee.  Once the patient is strong and comfortable with their new limb, they will not be required to go to therapy anymore. Throughout one's life, it is projected that a typical amputee will go through $1.4 million worth of treatment, including surgeries, prosthetics, as well as therapies.&lt;ref name="Cost of a Prosthetic Limb"/&gt;

===Low-cost===
{{See also|3D printing}}
Low-cost above-knee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function. This function is often achieved with crude, non-articulating, unstable, or manually locking knee joints. A limited number of organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), create devices for developing countries. Their device which is manufactured by CR Equipments is a single-axis, manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf |title=ICRC: Trans-Femoral Prosthesis&amp;nbsp;– Manufacturing Guidelines |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan for a low-cost artificial leg, designed by Sébastien Dubois, was featured at the 2007 International Design Exhibition and award show in Copenhagen, Denmark, where it won the [[Index: Award]]. It would be able to create an energy-return prosthetic leg for US [[United States dollar|$]]8.00, composed primarily of [[fiberglass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexaward.dk/2007/default.asp?id=706&amp;show=nomination&amp;nominationid=163&amp;playmovie=wmv INDEX:2007 INDEX: AWARD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202173652/http://www.indexaward.dk/2007/default.asp?id=706&amp;show=nomination&amp;nominationid=163&amp;playmovie=wmv |date=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one's residual limb to the ground.

The introduction of the [[Seattle Foot]] ([[Seattle Limb Systems]]) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an [[Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot]] (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.

Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.

With [[3D printing|3D printers]], it is possible to manufacture a single product without having to have metal [[Molding (process)|molds]], so the costs can be drastically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagata |first=Kazuaki |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/10/national/science-health/robot-arm-startup-taps-3-d-printers-in-quest-to-make-prosthetics-affordable/#.VeCJ9_btlBd |title=Robot arm startup taps 3-D printers in quest to make prosthetics affordable |publisher=Japantimes.co.jp |date=2015-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jaipur leg|Jaipur Foot]]'', an artificial limb from [[Jaipur]], [[India]], costs about US$40.

===Open-source robotic prothesis===
{{See also|Open-source hardware|Modular design|3D printing|Thingiverse}}
There is currently an [[Open-design movement|open-design]] Prosthetics forum known as the "[[Open Prosthetics Project]]".  The group employs collaborators and volunteers to advance Prosthetics technology while attempting to lower the costs of these necessary devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://OpenProsthetics.org |title=Open Prosthetics Website |publisher=Openprosthetics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open Bionics]] is a company that is developing open-source robotic prosthetic hands. It uses 3D printing to manufacture the devices and low-cost 3D scanners to fit them, with the aim of lowering the cost of fabricating custom prosthetics. A review study on a wide range of printed prosthetic hands, found that although 3D printing technology holds a promise for individualised prosthesis design, it is not necessarily cheaper when all costs are included. The same study also found that evidence on the functionality, durability and user acceptance of 3D printed hand prostheses is still lacking.&lt;ref name="Review 3D-printed hand prostheses"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kate|first1=Jelle ten|last2=Smit|first2=Gerwin|last3=Breedveld|first3=Paul|title=3D-printed upper limb prostheses: a review|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]|date=3 April 2017|volume=12|issue=3|pages=300–314|doi=10.1080/17483107.2016.1253117|pmid=28152642|issn=1748-3107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-cost prosthetics for children==
{{See also|open-source hardware|3D printing}}
In the USA an estimate was found of 32,500 children (&lt;21 years) that suffer from major paediatric amputation, with 5,525 new cases each year, of which 3,315 congenital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1946626|year=1991|author1=Krebs|first1=D.

A.|doi=10.1097/01241398-199205000-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr et al. (1998) investigated amputations caused by landmines for Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and Mozambique among children (&lt;14 years), showing estimates of respectively 4.7, 0.19, 1.11 and 0.67 per 1000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, D.B. |year=1998|title=Pain and Rehabilitation from Landmine Injury|url=http://e-safe-anaesthesia.org/e_library/10/Pain_and_rehabilitation_from_landmine_injuries_Update_2000.pdf|volume=6|issue=2|pages=91|journal=Update in Anaesthesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohan (1986) indicated in India a total of 424,000 amputees (23,500 annually), of which 10.3% had an onset of disability below the age of 14, amounting to a total of about 43,700 limb deficient children in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, D.

Few low-cost solutions have been created specially for children. Underneath some of them can be found.
[[File:Artificial limbs for a thalidomide child, 1961-1965. (9660575567).jpg|thumbnail|Artificial limbs for a juvenile [[thalidomide]] survivor 1961–1965]]

===Pole and crutch===
This hand-held pole with leather support band or platform for the limb is one of the simplest and cheapest solutions found. It serves well as a short-term solution, but is prone to rapid contracture formation if the limb is not stretched daily through a series of range-of motion (RoM) sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Strait, E. (2006) [http://www.oandp.org/publications/resident/pdf/DevelopingCountries.pdf ''Prosthetics in Deceloping Countries'']. oandp.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamboo, PVC or plaster limbs===
This also fairly simple solution comprises a plaster socket with a bamboo or PVC pipe at the bottom, optionally attached to a prosthetic foot. This solution prevents contractures because the knee is moved through its full RoM. The David Werner Collection, an online database for the assistance of disabled village children, displays manuals of production of these solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, David. [http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe002/dwe00201.html Disabled Village Children]. dinf.ne.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjustable bicycle limb===
This solution is built using a bicycle seat post up side down as foot, generating flexibility and (length) adjustability. It is a very cheap solution, using locally available materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, V. (2004) [http://www.ispo.ca/files/bicycle-prosthesis.pdf A victim assistance solution]. School of Industrial Design, Carleton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sathi Limb===
It is an endoskeletal modular lower limb from India, which uses thermoplastic parts. Its main advantages are the small weight and adaptability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Monolimb===
Monolimbs are non-modular prostheses and thus require more experienced prosthetist for correct fitting, because alignment can barely be changed after production. However, their durability on average is better than low-cost modular solutions.

== Cultural and social theory perspectives ==
A number of theorists have explored the meaning and implications of prosthetic extension of the body. [[Elizabeth Grosz]] writes, "Creatures use tools, ornaments, and appliances to augment their bodily capacities. Are their bodies lacking something, which they need to replace with artificial or substitute organs?...Or conversely, should prostheses be understood, in terms of aesthetic reorganization and proliferation, as the consequence of an inventiveness that functions beyond and perhaps in defiance of pragmatic need?"&lt;ref&gt;Grosz, Elizabeth (2003). "Prosthetic Objects" in ''The State of Architecture at the Beginning of the 21st Century''. pp. 96–97. The Monacelli Press. {{ISBN|1580931340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elaine Scarry]] argues that every artifact recreates and extends the body. Chairs supplement the skeleton, tools append the hands, clothing augments the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World|last=Scarry|first=Elaine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scarry's thinking, "furniture and houses are neither more nor less interior to the human body than the food it absorbs, nor are they fundamentally different from such sophisticated prosthetics as artificial lungs, eyes and kidneys. The consumption of manufactured things turns the body inside out, opening it up ''to'' and ''as'' the culture of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Lupton and Miller (1992). "Streamlining: The Aesthetics of Waste" in Taylor, M. and Preston, J. (eds.) 2006. ''Intimus: Interior Design Theory Reader''. pp. 204–212. {{ISBN|978-0-470-01570-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Wigley]], a professor of architecture, continues this line of thinking about how architecture supplements our natural capabilities, and argues that "a blurring of identity is produced by all prostheses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wigley, Mark |title=Prosthetic Theory: The Disciplining of Architecture|journal=Assemblage|issue=15|pages=6–29|doi=10.2307/3171122 |jstor=3171122|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this work relies on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s earlier characterization of man's relation to objects as one of extension.

'''''Questions of Truth''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] and Nicholas Beale which offers their responses to 51 questions about science and religion. The foreword is contributed by [[Antony Hewish]].

The book was launched at a workshop at the 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Annual Meeting in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml AAAS Annual Meeting 2009 Workshop Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304021809/http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml |date=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the UK at a discussion at the [[Royal Society]] chaired by [[Onora O'Neill]], in a week when it was also featured on the [[Today Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7918000/7918145.stm Interview with] [[John Polkinghorne]] by [[John Humphrys]] [[BBC]] [[Today Programme]] 2-Mar-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key themes and ideas==
[[File:AAAS Launch workshop1 m.JPG|thumb|upright|Launch at 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Annual Conference with President [[James J. McCarthy]] (standing) and authors]]
The book grew out of questions generated at a website organized to communicate Polkinghorne's ideas. It groups selected questions under seven topics:&lt;ref name="PWorld"&gt;[http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ One Scientist's Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415035123/http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ |date=April 15, 2009 }} review in ''[[Physics World]]'' April-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Leading Questions'' gives an overview of Polkinghorne's views on nine questions, including science and religion, the existence of God, and atheism.
# ''The Concept and Existence of God'' begins with "Can God's existence be proved?" and addresses ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[omniscience]], [[predestination]] and [[the Trinity]].
# ''The Universe'' considers the [[Big Bang]], the [[Anthropic Principle]] and a [[Theory of Everything]].
# ''Evolution'' starts with "Is evolution a fact or a theory?", discusses [[Intelligent Design]], which is deemed an unfortunate use of language and a theological mistake, and explores whether the mind can be explained by evolution.
# ''Evil'' suggests that "The evil that is not the result of human sin seems to be the result of the workings out of the natural laws of physics and biology" and considers the [[Devil]], cancer and [[Original Sin]].
# ''Human Being'' suggests that [[Adam and Eve]] refer to the first spiritually conscious human beings, that the [[soul]] is something ''logically'' distinct from the body but not a separate physical entity, and that [[conscience]] is "our deepest understanding of right and wrong".
# ''Religion'' begins with "Is atheism a form of faith?", suggests that "For each part of the Bible you have to ask what kind of writing it is and what God is trying to tell us through it", and considers the [[Resurrection]] and that "God will not force us to accept his love ... [but] will save everyone he can - no-one will be excluded because God did not want them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthquestion.com|title=Truth theory|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|date=|website=|publisher=Indian Times|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each question is followed by the responses of Beale and Polkinghorne, sometimes as a single answer and sometimes by the two authors individually. Its three appendixes constitute a third of the book:&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;
* ''Anthropic Fine-Tuning'' draws on [[Martin Rees]]'s book ''Just Six Numbers'' to illustrate the point that if the fundamental constants of physics were slightly different then no intelligent life could exist in the Universe. It then considers [[Multiverse]] ideas and especially [[Lee Smolin]]'s [[Cosmological natural selection]], which, it suggests, has problems from physics and evolutionary dynamics. It also discusses notions of complexity and improbability.
* ''Brain and Consciousness'' suggests that "pretty much everything in the universe has a physical aspect and an informational aspect, neither of which is more foundational than the other", and that informational entities like the [[Mass in B Minor]] cannot be considered as material objects. It proposes that "your body and your mind are different aspects of you", and that the inherent uncertainties of neuron firing mean that the brain is not fully deterministic.
* ''Evolution'' begins by pointing out that since [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] Christians have not taken the Genesis creation accounts "literally", and that key developers of the current theory (e.g. [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Simon Conway-Morris]] and [[Martin Nowak]]) have been Christians, suggesting that there is no conflict between Christianity and evolution, that small genetic changes can have big effects, that [[genetic determinism]] is mistaken, and that there are evolutionary benefits to religion.

==Reviews==

[[Julian Baggini]], writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', said that Polkinghorne has no problems reconciling his faith with his science and suggests that "despite the complexity of some of the scientific issues discussed", the book "is a commendably clear read".  He says "it is a pity that the people most likely to buy this book are those simply seeking intellectual reassurance that their faith is not irrational.  Those who would most benefit from reading it are in fact fundamentalists who think that evolutionary science must be wrong, and overconfident atheists who believe that the religious are manifestly irrational.” &lt;ref name = "FT"&gt;[[Julian Baggini]] "A Twist of Faith: How to reconcile religious belief with science" ''Financial Times'' Life and Arts, p.16, 21 Feb.,'09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]]'s [http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=708#comments additional comments on his talkingphilosophy site and the subsequent discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]] wrote a highly critical review in the ''[[New Humanist]]''. He states that the responses to questions concerning science and religion boil down to three strategies, [[God of the gaps]], [[inference to the best explanation]], and religion and science explain truths in [[non-overlapping magisteria|different domains]]. He considers the first two refutable by undergraduates, and for the third strategy to work, he contends that one has to "cherry-pick which bits of scripture and dogma are to be taken as symbolic and which as literally true" in order to conveniently avoid the possibility of direct and testable confrontation with science. He concludes the review by expressing his outrage at the [[Royal Society]]'s decision to allow its premises to be used for the launch of the book, as in his opinion this amounts to having "the superstitious lucubrations of illiterate goatherds living several thousand years ago given the same credibility as contemporary scientific research."&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;A. C. Grayling: [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1998 Book Review: Questions of Truth]. ''New Humanist'' 124 (2), March/April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Physics World]]'' commends the authors for handling the diverse readership, skeptics and believers, in a "remarkably even-handed way", but laments that concerns with specifics of Christian doctrine may limit the book's appeal; however, scientifically minded readers may find the extensive appendices a good starting point. The reviewer concludes that the book provides valuable insight for those interested in the science and religion debate.&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;

In addition, some periodicals have included brief reviews. &lt;!-- These are all less than a paragraph on the book. --&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, "Many readers will welcome this accessible format, but some may find the blurring of science and theology confusing."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6612221.html?industryid=47159 Publishers Weekly Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Library Journal]]'' described it as intriguing and a thought-provoking work, and said that [[John Polkinghorne]] was a “a kind of antidote to [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] for the intellectual theist or Christian."&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 Library Journal Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305095840/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Episcopal Life'' says the book offers "some interesting conclusions".&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life 3-Mar-09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312123834/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Sample, reflecting over his interview with Polkinghorne for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that there was much in the book that he found offensive, especially the idea that God needs to remain [[divine hiddenness|hidden]] from his creation lest they be completely overwhelmed, a notion Sample describes as "a bit patronising".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web | work=The Guardian | last=Sample | first=Ian | accessdate=19 January 2010 | date=9 April 2009 | title=Can science be used to prove the existence of God? | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/apr/09/religion-controversiesinscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7586">A '''Riboprobe,''' abbreviation of RNA probe''',''' is a segment of labelled RNA that can be used to detect a target mRNA or DNA during [[in situ hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Biomedicine|last=Lackie|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199549351}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA probes can be produced by ''[[in vitro]]'' transcription of cloned [[DNA]] inserted in a suitable [[plasmid]] downstream of a viral promoter. Some bacterial [[viruses]] code for their own [[RNA polymerase]]s, which are highly specific for the viral promoters. Using these [[enzymes]], labeled [[Nucleoside triphosphate|NTP]]s, and inserts inserted in both forward and reverse orientations, both sense and antisense riboprobes can be generated from a cloned [[gene]].

Since James Watson and Francis Crick revealed the [[Double-helix|double helix]] nature of DNA molecule(Watson &amp; Crick, 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=J.D.|last2=F.H.C.|first2=Crick|date=|title=Molecular structure of nucleic acids: A structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid|url=|journal=Nature|volume=171|pages=737–738|doi=10.1038/171737a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the hydrogen bonds between the four bases are well known: adenine always binds to thymine and cytosine always binds to guanine. This binding pattern is the basic principle of modern genetic technologies. Joseph Gall and Mary Lou Pardue published a paper in 1969 demonstrating that radioactive marked ribosomal DNA can be used to detect its complementary DNA sequence in a frog egg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.G.|last=Gall|last2=Pardue|first2=M.L.|date=1969|title=Formation and detection of RNA-DNA hybrid molecules in cytological preparations|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=63|pages=378–383|doi=10.1073/pnas.63.2.378|pmc=223575}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the first researchers who use DNA probes to perform in situ hybridization. RNA probes were proved to be able to perform the same function and also used with [[in situ hybridization]]. Fluorescent dyed probes replaced radio labeled probes due to the consideration of safety, stability, and ease of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudkin|first=G.T.|last2=Stollar|first2=B.D.|date=1977|title=High resolution of DNA-RNA hybrids in situ by indirect immunofluorescence|url=|journal=Nature|volume=265|pages=472–474|doi=10.1038/265472a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting a DNA sequence is similar to "looking for a needle in a haystack, with the needle being the DNA sequence of interest and the haystack being a set of chromosomes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Clare|last=O'Connor|date=2008|title=Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)|url=|journal=Nature Education|volume=1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;". The ability of the DNA helix to disassociate, re-anneal and the remarkable accuracy of base-pairing grants riboprobes the ability to locate its complementary DNA sequence on chromosomes.

There are two kinds of probes used during in situ hybridization: Riboprobes and DNA oligonucleotides probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology Practical Neurochemistry Method|last=Lajtha|first=Abel|publisher=Springer ScienceþBusiness Media|year=2007|isbn=9780387303598|location=United States|pages=364|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riboprobes are essential in the study of embryo development in which DNA probes are insufficient. With labelled (fluoresce-dyed, for instance) antisense RNA probes hybridized with developing embryo's mRNA, tracking the expression of genes in different stages of development is possible. RNA probes can be used in detecting either whole embryo's development or just on tissue sections of interest. The ability of riboprobes to bind to transcripted mRNA makes RNA probes important in research on [[model organism]]s: Drosophila, zebrafish, chick, [[Xenopus]] and mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Situ Hybridization|last=Clark|first=Melody|year=1996|isbn=9783527308859}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA probes can also be utilized in [[immunohistochemistry]] to identify tissue infection in embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.R.|first=Kapczy|year=2001|title=Detection of In Ovo-Inoculated Infectious Bronchitis Virus by Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Hybridization with a Riboprobe in Epithelial Cells of the Lung and Cloaca|journal=AVIAN DISEASES|volume= 46| issue =  3 (Jul.- Sep., 2002)|pages=679–685|doi=10.1637/0005-2086(2002)046[0679:doioii]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral mRNA can be targeted by its antisense RNA probes, while infected tissues don't have complementary mRNA that can hybridize with probes; the unique mRNA sequence of each organism makes the detection of expression of certain gene highly effective and accurate.

[[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH)is the most widely used riboprobe technique. A target sequence and a probe are essential in FISH. First, the probe is labeled with either direct or indirect labeling strategy: hapten-modified nucleotides are used in indirect labeling, and fluorophore-modified nucleotides are used in direct labeling. The target DNA and probes are denatured and mixed, allows the re-annealing of DNA sequences. Indirect labeling requires an extra step to produce visualized signals that requires use of enzymatic or immunological system, but provides greater signal amplification than direct labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speicher|first=M.R. et al|date=2005|title=The new cytogenetics: blurring the boundaries with molecular biology|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=6|pages=784|doi=10.1038/nrg1692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FISH probes can also be used in [[karyotype]] studies. DNA probes can be labeled with various fluorochromes  which produce a unique color for each chromosomes. The probes are then hybridized with metaphase chromosomes, producing unique patterns on each chromosomes. This method is useful when people want to study the translocation, deletion and duplication of chromosomes on a larger scale comparing to site-specific FISH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNeil|first=N.|last2=Ried|first2=T.|date=2000|title=Novel molecular cytogenetic techniques for identifying complex chromosomal rearrangements: technology and applications in molecular medicine|url=|journal=Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudder ratio''' refers to a value that is monitored by the computerized [[flight control system]]s in modern [[aircraft]]. The ratio relates the  aircraft airspeed to the [[rudder]] deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently [[Flight dynamics|yaw]], or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scott Sunken Garden landmark has a list of historically significant ties including 1930's "Golden Age of American Landscaping", Immigration, Civil Rights, and Lansing's Beautification.&lt;ref name="Non-profit Community Advocacy Organized for Scott Sunken Gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden |title=Scott Sunken Garden, Friends |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

The garden appears to meet national register criteria B and C...." &lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-sunken-garden-friends/national-register-coordinators-recommendation-of-scott-sunken-gardens-historical/1027945290586784 |title=National Register Coordinator’s recommendation of Scott Sunken Garden’s historical recognition as a national asset |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states. Justice Edward Cahill served in the Michigan Supreme Court in 1890.&lt;ref name="Men of Progress, Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men With an Outline History of the State, Dedicated to the Newspaper Press of Michigan Detroit, Michigan Published by the Evening News Association 1900"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/137660544586/permalink/10154507434494587/ |title=Historical Society of Greater Lansing public group &amp;#124; Facebook &amp;#124; "Men of Progress" |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cahill also concurred upholding [[Racial equality]] in USA's landmark Civil Right's "William W.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Scott Garden Grotto.jpg|thumb|]]
The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

Original Petition for Lansing Parks and Recreation: "Save Scott Park and the Sunken Garden"

Request for more ideal alternative and assistance with concerns by officials: "Two Downtown Lansing Substations Audit and Investigation into Concerns by Mayor and LBW" &lt;ref name="Scott Sunken Garden advocacy petitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansinggarden.com/petitions |title=Public petitions |publisher=lansinggarden.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technological rationality''' or '''technical rationality''' is a philosophical idea postulated by the  [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] in his 1941 article, "Some Implications of Modern Technology", published first in the journal Studies in Philosophy and Social Sciences, Vol. IX. It gained mainstream repute and a more holistic treatment in his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. 

It posits that [[Rationality|rational]] decisions to incorporate [[technology|technological]] advances into society can, once the technology is ubiquitous, change what is considered rational within that society.

The '''Thames Discovery Programme''' is a [[community archaeology]] project, focusing on the archaeology of the River [[Thames]] on the [[Tideway]]. The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) was launched in October 2008 and until September 2011, the project was supported by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and a grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |title=Heritage Lottery Fund |publisher=Hlf.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211220147/http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |archivedate=11 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is designed to communicate an understanding and informed enjoyment of the historic Thames to the widest possible audience, and to train and support members of the public (the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG) to monitor and record the [[archaeology]] of the foreshore during the lifetime of the project, and into the future.

The project builds on initiatives pioneered by the Museum of London’s Thames Archaeological Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/riverpedia/the-thames-archaeological-survey |title=Thames Archaeological Survey |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that took place from 1993–1999, the work of commercial archaeological units, such as [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/|title=Museum of London Archaeology |publisher=museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thames Explorer Trust’s innovative education projects. Over three years, archaeologists from the programme surveyed 20 archaeological sites along the tidal Thames in the Greater London area, supported by the work of the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/about/the_frog |title=The FROG |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who monitor the surveyed sites for changes, as the daily tides scour away the remaining archaeological features. The FROG is made up of volunteer members of the public, who are trained in foreshore recording techniques, the history and archaeology of the River Thames, health and safety and participation in digital media by the TDP team.

The TDP currently has a small staff team and is hosted by [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"/&gt; Other partners and supporters include the Thames Explorer Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thames-explorer.org.uk/ |title=Thames Explorer Trust |publisher=Thames-explorer.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of London]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ Museum of London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222235451/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ |date=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Port of London Authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Port of London – www.pla.co.uk |url=http://www.pla.co.uk/ |title=Port of London Authority |publisher=Pla.co.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/ |title=English Heritage |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University College London]] [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/ |title=Institute of Archaeology |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cohen |first= Nathalie |authorlink= |author2=Gustav Milne |author3=Eliott Wagg  |date= 2012-12-01|title=The Thames Discovery Programme: Public Engagement and Research on London’s Foreshore |journal=Archaeology International |volume= 15 |issue= |pages= 99–106 |id= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/ai.1506 |doi=10.5334/ai.1506|pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
[[File:Recording the causeway at Isleworth.JPG|thumb|Recording the causeway at Isleworth]]
Using data generated by the Thames Archaeological Survey, the Thames Discovery Programme selected twenty key sites across the [[Greater London]] area for further recording and on-going monitoring during 2008 - 2011. The first site chosen was [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House, London]]; in February 2009, FROG members recorded the causeway, parts of the 1819 riverside wall, the Custom House [[gridiron plan|gridiron]], the remains of two [[ship|vessels]] partly buried on the foreshore and a multi-phase [[revetment]] structure located under [[Billingsgate]] Wharf.

In April 2009, an examination of access to the foreshore at [[Isleworth]] included recording the 20th century boat [[slipway]] and the remains of the Victorian ‘Church Ferry’ [[causeway]].

During low tides in June and July 2009, survey and recording at [[Charlton, London]], formerly the location of Castle’s Shipbreakers Yard focused on the ‘stack’ of very large ships timbers surviving at the top of the foreshore which represent the remains of one or more [[warship]] class vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23724819-volunteers-hunt-bank-of-thames-for-clues-of-lost-victorian-warships.do |title=Volunteers hunt bank of Thames for clues of lost Victorian warships |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nautical]] remains are very well represented at this site where, in addition to the ‘stack’, we have also discovered a slipway constructed of reused ship and boat timbers, as well as the remains of at least three smaller vessels. During the 2009 Summer Season, teams worked at Alderman Stairs (near [[St Katharine Docks]]), [[Putney]] and [[Bermondsey]]. In November 2009, the first FROG-led project at Carrara Wharf in [[Fulham]] recorded part of the 1729 bridge to [[Putney]], while a TDP survey earlier in the year on the foreshore in front of [[Fulham Palace]] found [[Iron Age]] timber piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk/2009/11/fulham-foreshore-reveals-ancie.html |title=Fulham foreshore reveals ancient secrets |publisher=Shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2010, investigations on the [[Isle of Dogs]] with the Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesandfield.com/ |title=Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society |publisher=Thamesandfield.com |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the remains of a human skeleton, dating to the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/discoveries-on-the-isle-of-dogs |title=Discoveries on the Isle of Dogs |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tower Buckle.jpg|thumb|left|A buckle found on the Tower of London foreshore in July 2010]]
During the 2010 Summer Season, work continued on the [[Isle of Dogs]], recording the remains of the slipways used during the launch of the [[SS Great Eastern]], the last project of engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. In July 2010, the TDP team and the FROG worked on the foreshore at the [[Tower of London]], undertaking survey and recording of an area normally closed to the public. Sections of the riverside wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/tower-of-london-fieldwork-report |title=Tower of London Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recorded and data collected to create a contour survey of the foreshore surface. 

The team also worked with members of the Society of Thames Mudlarks and the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finds.org.uk/ |title=Portable Antiquities Scheme |publisher=Finds.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to record artefacts found on the surface. The TDP field team then moved to [[Greenwich]] where the riverside wall was again examined, together with parts of a Tudor timber jetty and a newly discovered medieval structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-report |title=Greenwich Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also featured on the BBC's [[Digging for Britain]]. During late August 2010, work was undertaken at two sites in West London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/strand-on-the-green-frog-report |title=Strand on the Green Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in September, fieldwork was undertaken at Tripcockness near the [[Royal Arsenal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/ballast-blog |title=Tripcockness Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rotherhithe]].

In January 2011, the project published the results of recent investigations at Vauxhall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall |title=Vauxhall discoveries |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the remains of the oldest structure so far discovered in the London area, dating to the late Mesolithic period, have been recorded by the Thames Discovery Programme, English Heritage and the Museum of London.

During the 2011 summer field season, the TDP worked at [[Brentford]], recording the remains of two vessels abandoned on the foreshore, and at [[Wapping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/raindrops-keep-falling |title=Raindrops keep falling |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveying the watermans' causeway and nautical remains. Further fieldwork was also undertaken at Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-update|title=Greenwich fieldwork update |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Tower of London foreshore.

== Outreach and events ==
[[File:Recording the gridiron at Custom House, London.jpg|thumb|Recording the gridiron at Custom House]]
The Thames Discovery Programme runs a programme of events and activities designed to engage the public with the archaeology and history of the river. [[Outreach]] activities undertaken by the project including public lectures, small exhibitions, information stands, guided walks on the foreshore, observation of the FROG members in action on site and events for families and school groups, seminars, workshops and conferences. 

In 2009 the Thames Discovery Programme worked with a number of different organisations including Fulham Palace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhampalace.org/ |title=Fulham Palace |publisher=Fulham Palace |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/ |title=Historic Royal Palaces |publisher=Hrp.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnersbury Park Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts/gunnersburyparkmuseum/ |title=Gunnersbury Park |publisher=Hounslow.gov |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camden Young Archaeologists Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp Camden Young Archaeologists Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325072443/http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of East London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/ |title=University of East London |publisher=Uel.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thames Explorer Trust, Thames Estuary Partnership, the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/LAARC/ |title=LAARC |publisher=museumoflondon.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Worshipful Company of Antiquarian Collectors, the Museum of London and [[Museum in Docklands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11286">[[File:Aristotle and Phyllis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Woodcut of Aristotle ridden by Phyllis by [[Hans Baldung]], 1515]]
The '''tale of Phyllis and Aristotle''' is a [[Cautionary tale|cautionary medieval tale]] about the triumph of a seductive woman, Phyllis, over the greatest male intellect, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]]. It is one of several [[Power of Women]] stories from that time. Among early versions is the French '''''Lai d'Aristote''''' from 1220.

The story of the [[dominatrix]] and the famous intellectual was taken up by artists from the 12th century onwards, in media from stone sculpture in churches to panels of wood or ivory, textiles such as carpets and tapestries, engravings, oil paintings, brass jugs ([[aquamanile]]), and stained glass. Artists attracted to the theme include [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and [[Alessandro Turchi]].

==Story==
The tale varies in the telling, but the core of it is as follows: [[Aristotle]] advised his pupil [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] to avoid the [[Philip of Macedon|king]]'s seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her. She agreed to ride him, on condition that she could play the role of [[dominatrix]]. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Phyllis is also described as Alexander's mistress, or possibly wife, rather than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=[[Art Institute Chicago]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Justin E.

===Origins===
The story is said by the [[Louvre]] to derive from the German work &lt;!--''{{Aristoteles und Phyllis|de}}'' --&gt;by [[Jacques de Vitry]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; The French work ''Le {{ill|Lai d'Aristote|fr}}'' (The Lay of Aristotle) is known from manuscripts dating from as early as 1220, attributed by scholars to either [[Henri d'Andeli]] or {{ill|Henri de Valenciennes|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wathelet-Willem, Jeanne. "[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_1953_num_31_1_2167_t1_0084_0000_3 Henri d'Andeli. ''Le lai d'Aristote'', publié d'après tous les manuscrits par Maurice Delbouille]", in ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 1953, Vol. 31, n° 31-1, pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Zufferey, "Un problème de paternité: le cas d'Henri d'Andeli. II. Arguments linguistiques", ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 68, 2004, pp. 57–78, and "Henri de Valenciennes, auteur du Lai d'Aristote et de la Vie de saint Jean l'Évangéliste", in ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 69, 2004, pp. 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The source of the work was still contested in 2007 - see Mihai Cristian Bratu, ''L'Émergence de l'auteur dans l'historiographie médiévale en prose en langue française'', Ph.D., New York University, 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386, the English poet [[John Gower]] included a summary of the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (in English, unlike his other major works), a collection of stories of immoral love told in verse. It appears in the poem on [[Apollonius of Tyre]] (Book 8, 271–2018), where Gower quips that the philosopher's logic and syllogisms do not save him:&lt;ref name=DNBG&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gower, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''I syh there Aristotle also'',&lt;br&gt;
:''Whom that the queene of Grece so''&lt;br&gt;
:''Hath [[bridle]]d, that in thilke time''&lt;br&gt;
:''Sche made him such a [[Syllogism|Silogime]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he foryat al his [[Logic|logique]];''&lt;br&gt;
:''Ther was non art of his [[Aristotle#Practical philosophy|Practique]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''Thurgh which it mihte ben excluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he ne was fully concluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''To love, and dede his obeissance''

Also in the 14th century, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] John Herold wrote a Latin version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarton |first1=George |authorlink=George Sarton |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |journal=Isis |date=1930 |volume=14 |pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latin and English"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phyllis and Aristotle|url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|accessdate=1 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122070456/http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|archivedate=22 November 2012|language=Latin|quote=ARISTOTLES, cum doceret Alexandrum ut se contineret ab accessu frequenti uxoris suae, quae erat pulcra valde, ne animum suum a communi providentia impediret, et Alexander ei acquiesceret, hoc advertens regina et dolens, coepit Aristotelem trahere ad amorem suum, quia multociens sola transibat cum pedibus nudis et dissoluto crine, ut eum alliceret.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, it was featured in the German comedy ''Ain Spil van Maister Aristotiles'' (A play of Master Aristotle).&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Briski, Marija Javor |editor1=Winkelman, Johan H. |editor2=Wolf, Gerhard |title=Eine Warnung vor dominanten Frauen oder Behajung der Sinnenlust?

===Medieval===

The [[cautionary tale]] of the dominatrix who made a fool of the famous philosopher became popular across medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"/&gt; Medieval sculptors in Maasland created [[aquamanile]], jugs in the forms of scenes with human or other figures, depicting Phyllis and Aristotle. The story was depicted in a variety of media including stone, ivory, brass, carpet, [[tapestry]], and engravings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Early Modern to Enlightenment===
Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Jan Sadeler]] continued to exploit the theme, eventually with Phyllis entirely naked.&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web |title=Phyllis and Aristotle {{!}} The Triumph of Seduction over Intellect |url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/phyllis-and-aristotle |publisher=[[Louvre]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Turchi]] called the woman [[Campaspe]], the mistress of Alexander. The works used media including engraving, stained glass, wood, and oil painting.

===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Artists such as [[Julio Ruelas]] continued to adapt the Phyllis and Aristotle theme.
[[Oscar Kokoschka]] produced a version in 1913.&lt;ref name="Hayton2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hayton |first1=Darin |title=The Curious History of Phyllis on Aristotle |url=http://dhayton.haverford.edu/blog/2016/02/19/the-curious-history-of-phyllis-on-aristotle/#fn:72587 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urethral intercourse''' or ''coitus per urethram'' is [[sexual penetration]] of the female [[urethra]] by an object such as a [[Human penis|penis]] or a finger.  It is not the same thing as [[urethral sounding]], the act of inserting a specialized medical tool into the urethra as a form of sexual or fetishistic activity.

The untrained [[Urethral foreign body|insertion]] of foreign bodies into the urethra carries a significant risk that subsequent medical attention may be required.  Documented cases of urethral intercourse appear to have occurred between heterosexual couples;  a survey of the global medical literature available in 1965 reported accounts of thirteen separate cases.&lt;ref name=JAMA1965&gt;{{cite journal

Presenting symptoms of unintentional urethral intercourse include [[primary infertility]], [[dyspareunia]] (pain during intercourse), and incontinence.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; More serious consequences include [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] via the urethra and [[bladder rupture]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The '''Vermont State Colleges''' (VSC) is the U.S. state of [[Vermont|Vermont's]] system of [[University system|public colleges]]. It functions as a [[governance]] organization, and was created by act of the [[Vermont General Assembly]] in 1961. There are presently four colleges in the VSC consortium, they are: [[Castleton University]], [[Community College of Vermont]], [[Northern Vermont University]], and the [[Vermont Technical College]]. Together, more than 13,000 students are enrolled in the colleges of the VSC.

While VSC, the state colleges' governing organization, was created in the mid-20th century, most of the component colleges are older. The state legislature first chartered Castleton University as a grammar school in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleton.edu/about-castleton/our-campus/ Our Campus]. Castleton.edu. Retrieved on 2017-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson State College was founded in 1828. The Vermont Technical College was founded in 1866. Lyndon State College was founded in 1911. Community College of Vermont, founded in 1970, was founded after the creation of the VSC. The newest institution, Northern Vermont University, was created in 2018 by merging Johnson State College and Lyndon State College together, combining administration but keeping the campuses separate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/11/29/coming-soon-northern-vermont-university-johnson-and-lyndon&lt;/ref&gt;

The VSC was headquartered at the Chancellors Office in [[Waterbury, Vermont|Waterbury]] until August 2011 when [[Tropical Storm Irene]] forced it to relocate temporarily. After one year of temporary location at the Vermont Tech Enterprise Center in [[Randolph, Vermont|Randolph]], the Chancellor's Office found a new, permanent home in [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].

The Chancellor's office is a directorate performing day to day financial and policy operations. It is headed by the chancellor, and three vice presidents. Each of the state colleges has its own president and deans. A [[Council of Presidents]], made up of the constituent colleges' presidents, VSC chancellor, and VSC vice presidents serves as an executive leadership team. The Council of Presidents works with the fifteen member Board of Trustees, to set policies and procedures. The [[Governor of Vermont]] serves as an [[Ex-officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the board.

Almost sixty percent of VSC students come from the state of Vermont. Approximately forty percent come from over forty other U.S. states, and more than forty-five countries. Class size is small, the average faculty to student ratio across the five colleges is 1:16. Nearly ninety percent of the faculty hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate level terminal degree in their field of instruction.

In [[forestry]], '''windthrow''' or '''blowdown''' refers to [[tree]]s uprooted or broken by [[wind]]. 
Breakage of the tree [[bole (botany)|bole]] (trunk) instead of uprooting is sometimes called '''windsnap'''.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Douglas C.|title=Identifying Trees at Risk from Ice and Wind|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/icewind.pdf|publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|date=1999|quote=Damage such as this often renders a tree bole susceptible to “windsnap” at the point of injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Windthrow is common in all forested parts of the world that experience storms or high wind speeds. The risk of windthrow to a tree is related to the tree's size (height and diameter), the 'sail area' presented by its crown, the anchorage provided by its roots, its exposure to the wind, and the local wind climate. A common way of quantifying the risk of windthrow to a forest area is to model the probability or 'return time' of a wind speed that would damage those trees at that location. Tree [[senescence]] can also be a factor, where multiple factors contributing to the declining health of a tree reduce its anchorage and therefore increase its susceptibility to windthrow. The resulting damage can be a significant factor in the development of a forest.

Windthrow can also increase following [[logging]], especially in young [[Forest management|forests managed]] specifically for [[timber]]. The removal of trees at a forest's edge increases the exposure of the remaining trees to the wind.

Trees that grow adjacent to lakes or other natural forest edges, or in exposed situations such as hill sides, develop greater rooting strength through growth feedback with wind movement, i.e. 'adaptive' or 'acclimative' growth. If a tree does not experience much wind movement during the [[stem exclusion]] phase of [[forest dynamics|stand succession]], it is not likely to develop a resistance to wind. Thus, when a fully or partially developed stand is bisected by a new road or by a [[clearcutting|clearcut]], the trees on the new edge are less supported by neighbouring trees than they were and may not be capable of withstanding the higher forces which they now experience.

Trees with heavy growths of [[ivy]], [[wisteria]], or [[kudzu]] are already stressed and may be more susceptible to windthrow, as the additional foliage increases the tree's sail area.

Trees with decayed trunk, [[fungus]]-induced [[canker]]s and [[woodboring beetle|borer]] damages are more susceptible to "windsnap".&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

== Ecological effects ==
Windthrow disturbance generates a variety of unique ecological resources on which certain forest processes are highly dependent. Windthrow can be considered a cataclysmic [[abiotic factor]] that can generate an entire new chain of [[Seral community|seral plant succession]] in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Windthrow can also be considered to act as a rejuvenating process whereby regeneration is made possible with new resource availability.

Severe uprooting opens bare patches of mineral soil that can act as seed sinks. These patches have been shown, in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, to have higher [[biodiversity]] than the surrounding forest floor. Additionally, the gap created in the forest canopy when windthrow occurs yields an increase in light, moisture, and nutrient availability in near proximity to the disturbance.

Toppled trees have the potential of becoming [[nurse log]]s, nurturing habitats for other forest organisms.
