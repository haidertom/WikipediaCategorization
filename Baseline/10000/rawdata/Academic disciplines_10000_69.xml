'''Alicante Innovation + Territory''' is a [[strategic plan]] for the [[Province of Alicante]], Spain (Southern Europe).

It initiated from the collaboration agreement signed in 2007 by [[Alicante Provincial Council]] (Diputación Provincial de Alicante) and the savings bank CAM -as strategic partners- with the Foundation Metrópoli -knowledge partner-.&lt;ref&gt;"Programa Innovacion + Territorio. Provincia de Alicante." 2009; Alfonso Vegara. Legal Deposit (Alicante) A-491-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A team led by the president of Metropoli Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmetropoli.org/ Metropolis Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; the architect [[Alfonso Vegara]],&lt;ref&gt;"HESP" (Higher Education of Spatial Planning). Zurich, 2012. Bernd Scholl. {{ISBN|978-3-7281-3522-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was President of [[ISOCARP]] (2002–05) and received the "European City and Regional Planning Award" of [[ECTP-CEU]] in 2006, conducted an analytical report that contains a wide range of solutions for the Province of Alicante. They were inspired in the philosophy of the "Smart Places"&lt;ref&gt;"Territorios Inteligentes". 2004; Alfonso Vegara y Juan Luis de las Rivas. {{ISBN|84-609-2698-2}} and Legal Deposit (Madrid) M-46586-2004&lt;/ref&gt; and as result of a selection of its proposals ''Province of Alicante Innovation + Territory Programme'' was released, financed and offered to the [[civil society]] by the strategic partners for free.
*The aim of this strategic plan is to promote the development of the towns in Alicante Province in order to make it more competitive and sustainable.  ''Alicante I + T Programme'' considers territorial transformation as the keystone in an economic development process based on innovation and knowledge.
*The focus is to facilitate the [[adaptation]] of the territory and their economic activities to the new challenges of the future, involving in the process the civil society as well as the public and private sectors.
*The tools with which to carry out the strategic proposals for each of the ''functional areas'' are the "Zero Agencies" ([[business incubator]]) and the [[Business cluster|Clusters]].

''Alicante I+T Programme'' is based in the "[[European Spatial Development Perspective]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/pdf/sum_en.pdf  "The book of the E.S.D.P., Towards balanced and sustainable development of the territory of the European Union"] {{ISBN|92-828-7658-6}} Official Publications of the European Communities, 1999 Luxembourg&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]]'s Communication "Putting knowledge into practice: a broad-based innovation strategy for the EU”&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/eu2020/growth_and_jobs/i23035_en.htm European Communication (2006) 502]&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[European Council|Council]], the [[European Parliament|Parliament]], the [[Economic and Social Committee]], and the [[Committee of the Regions]], as well as the "Europe Innova Initiative"&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/innovation/en/policy/europe-innova.htm Europe Innova Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; under the ''6th Framework Programme''.

In April 2009 a group of representatives of the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]] in London visited Alicante in order to understand the programme ''Alicante Innovation + Territory''.

This project was promoted from [[Suma Gestión Tributaria]], which is the public provincial body that manages mainly [[property tax]] and [[cartography]], forming part of Alicante Provincial Council during 2010. 
Nowadays, finished its promotion, ''Alicante Innovation + Territory'' is in the area of Local Development of that Provincial Council.

'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This can involve concepts championed by [[Ordinary-language philosophy|ordinary language]] philosophers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Heidegger, and others.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], ''[[Goethe in the Roman Campagna]]'', 1787, portrait of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], German artist known for his works of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, visual arts, and science.]]
An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of art and artists ==
&lt;!--

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">The '''Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society''' (AMOS) is an independent [[learned society]] that supports and fosters interest in [[Meteorology]], [[Oceanography]] and other related sciences. AMOS was founded in April 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amos.org.au/documents/item/85 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719235653/http://www.amos.org.au/documents/item/85 |archivedate=2008-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the Australian Branch of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] which at the time had existed for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amos.org.au/documents/item/84 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719235745/http://www.amos.org.au/documents/item/84 |archivedate=2008-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMOS publishes the bi-monthly ''[[Bulletin of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]]'', and quarterly the scientific journal ''[[The Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal]]''.

==Statement on Climate Change==
[[File:Climate scientists protest CSIRO staff cuts AMOS conference.jpg|thumb|right|Climate scientists attending the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) climate science conference in Melbourne stage protest against cuts to CSIRO climate research programs. Photo: John Englart]]AMOS has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude, “Global [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] are real and observable…It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of [[greenhouse gases]] in the [[atmosphere]] have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] has increased by more than 30% since the start of the [[industrial age]] and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning [[fossil fuels]], broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amos.org.au/publications/cid/3/t/publications AMOS ''Statement on Climate Change'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 many of the climate scientists attending the annual AMOS conference in Melbourne participated in a lunchtime protest against the CSIRO cuts to climate research programs announced by CSIRO CEO [[Larry_R._Marshall|Larry Marshall]] on 4 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CSIRO head Larry Marshall defends climate research cuts as angry scientists protest in Melbourne|url = http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/csiro-head-larry-marshall-defends-climate-research-cuts-as-angry-scientists-protest-in-melbourne-20160208-gmo81n.html|website = Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese Text Project''' (CTP; {{zh|t=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}) is a [[digital library]] project that assembles collections of [[Chinese classics|early Chinese texts]]. The name of the project in Chinese literally means "The Chinese Philosophical Book Digitization Project", showing its focus on books related to [[Chinese philosophy]]. It aims at providing accessible and accurate versions of a wide range of texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.princeton.edu/chinese-historiography/electronic-resources/databases-electronic-text/ | title = Classical Historiography for Chinese History: Databases &amp; electronic texts | last = Elman | first = Benjamin A. | publisher = Princeton University | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those relating to Chinese philosophy, and the site is credited with providing one of the most comprehensive and accurate collections of classical Chinese texts on the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpa-net.org/scholarship.html Association of Chinese Philosophers in North America (北美中国哲学学者协会)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjfraser.net/links/#etext Chris Fraser], Department of Philosophy, University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being one of the most useful textual databases for scholars of early Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;http://warpweftandway.com/support-the-chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagehat.com/chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site contents==

Texts are divided into pre-Qin and Han texts, and post-Han texts, with the former categorized by [[Hundred Schools of Thought|school of thought]] and the latter by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]]. The ancient (pre-Qin and Han) section of the database contains over 5 million Chinese characters, the post-Han database over 20 million characters, and the publicly editable [[wiki]] section over 5 billion characters.&lt;ref name="ctext.org"&gt;http://ctext.org/system-statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Many texts also have English and Chinese translations, which are paired with the original text paragraph by paragraph as well as phrase by phrase for ease of comparison; this makes it possible for the system to be used as a useful scholarly research tool even by students with little or no knowledge of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Connolly | first = Tim | date = 2012 | title = Learning Chinese Philosophy with Commentaries | url = https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2012_0035_0001_0001_0018 | journal = Teaching Philosophy | publisher = Philosophy Documentation Center | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | access-date= March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit''' is a branch of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], based in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. The CBSU is a world-leading centre for cognitive neuroscience, with a mission to improve human health by understanding and enhancing cognition and behaviour in health, disease and disorder. It is one of the largest and most long-lasting contributors to the development of psychological theory and practice. 

The CBSU has its own [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI, 3T) scanner on-site, as well as a 306-channel [[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) system and a 128-channel [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) laboratory.

The CBSU is now an internationally leading centre for research in the cognitive sciences and neurosciences, with close links to clinical neuroscience research in the University of Cambridge Medical School. Over 140 scientists, students, and support staff work in research areas such as Memory, Attention, Emotion, Speech and Language, Development and Aging, Computational Modelling and Neuroscience Methods. With dedicated facilities available on site, the Unit has particular strengths in the application of neuroimaging techniques in the context of well-developed neuro-cognitive theory.

== History ==

The unit was established in 1944 as the '''MRC Applied Psychology Unit'''.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG"&gt;{{cite Q|Q29581668}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the [[History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group]] held a [[witness seminar]] to gather information on the unit's history.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG" /&gt;

On 1 July 2017, the CBU was merged with the University of Cambridge. Coming under the Clinical School, the unit is still funded by the British government through Research Councils UK but is managed and maintained by Cambridge University.

'''DJhistory.com''' is a website dedicated to the history of [[dance music]] and [[DJing]], and also an online record label and book publishing company. It aims to encourage interest in obscure, overlooked and collectible dance music (in its broadest sense), by creating an archive of reference material on the subject and by licensing and reissuing rare and exceptional music for download.

==History==
DJhistory.com was launched in November 1999 by dance music historians [[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton as an online continuation of their book ''[[Last Night a DJ Saved My Life (book)|Last Night A DJ Saved My Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Bill &amp; Broughton, Frank (1999). ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey'', p.3. Headline Books Ltd., London. {{ISBN|0-7553-1398-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The website developed into an expert forum of DJs and dance music collectors sharing knowledge about back-catalogue music,&lt;ref&gt;Power, Mike. "Dance music's virtual basement is now open", ''[[The Guardian]] music blog'', 2008-09-19&lt;/ref&gt; including notable DJs [[François Kevorkian]], [[David Mancuso]], [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]], Prins Thomas and Todd Terje.&lt;ref&gt;Muggs, Joe. "I love Disco", ''[[Mixmag]]'' 2008-10 p60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
DJhistory.com contains full-length transcripts of interviews with many notable DJs and dance music pioneers, which were the source material for Broughton and Brewster’s books; an archive of magazine articles relating to the history of dance music; reviews of music, books and DVDs; and "Mystery Mixes", DJ mixes of obscure music which the site’s forum members attempt to identify.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Ben. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/digitalmedia.digitalmusic?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technologyfull   "Online"] ''[[The Observer]] Music Monthly'' 2008-10-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verma, Rahul "Where to find good music for nothing" ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'', 2008-08-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 DJhistory.com was relaunched with the addition of a music download service selling digital versions of rare and collectible records, including its signature "Secret Weapons" series of powerful but obscure or overlooked dance tracks chosen by a notable DJ from their own collection.&lt;ref&gt;"Secret Weapons Revealed", ''iDJ'', 2008-09&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFMS.pdf|thumb|EFMS]]
'''Energy and facility management software''' is a term used to refer to an enterprise-wide platform for handling technical data related to buildings and stems from the merger of [[Energy management software|EMS]] (energy management software), [[Computer-aided facility management|CAFM]] (Computer Aided Facility Management) and [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software). As such it involves the gathering and processing or information that is required for maintaining acceptable indoor comfort level while minimizing energy use.

==Purpose==
An EFMS serves a dual purpose:

*'''Tactical:''' On a day-to-day operational level an EFMS will help improve comfort level where required while minimizing energy consumption. Should comfort level not be an issue, the EFMS will focus processes and resources on reducing energy spending.
*'''Strategic:''' On a mid-to-long term scope an EFMS will support the development strategy of the organization with information that will support managerial decisions such as systems, vendors or processes efficiencies, ratings and critical areas etc.

== Method ==

=== Information Classes ===
To achieve its purpose an EFMS integrates several informational classes in a common processing environment, mainly:

*'''Energy consumption information''' information commonly handled by an EMS and derived from online metering devices (such as [[Electric energy meter|Energy meters]], [[Gas meter]]s).
*'''System information''' such as [[HVAC|HVAC systems]] settings, sensor readings etc. commonly resident in a [[Building Management System|BMS]].
*'''Assets Information''', such as building size, floor number and area, cooling capacity of installed [[HVAC|HVAC systems]], maintenance logs etc. commonly found in a CAFM system.
*'''Weather information''' commonly derived from internet weather feeds or locally installed sensors.
*'''Occupancy / Use information''' such as room occupancy of a hotel or customers served at a retail store commonly found in an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]].
*'''Utility bills information''' commonly resident in an [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software).

=== Components ===
An EFMS should be consisted of at least the following modules:

*'''Visualization / Dashboard Module''' which will present graphical or table illustrations of energy information (from EMS), system information (from BMS) and Billing information (from EAS).
*'''Alarming Module''' which will create and manage alarms based on given threshold values and / or Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis detection methods.
*'''Work Order Module''' which will create and manage notifications of alarms directed towards appropriate users. The Work Order Module will manage actions of users related to each fault along the Fault Cycle (birth, detection, diagnosis, action, evaluation).
*'''Data Sources Module''' which will manage the connection to and synchronization with the various data sources such as energy management systems and metering devices, [[Building Management System|BMS]], [[Energy accounting software|EAS]], [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] etc.
*'''Reporting Module''' which will manage the creation and distribution of energy and facility reports.

=== Processes ===
The processes performed in an EFMS fall under the categories of:
*'''Entry Processes''' which may be ''tactical'' such as the automated synchronization with a BMS or ERP or ''ad hoc'' such as the manual entry of utility bills data or the upload of a maintenance log.
*'''FDD Processes''' (''Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis'') which may include sub-processes for setting various thresholds, selecting from a list of rules which ones should be applied to each specific building / installation and the tactical application of rule sets and threshold values to an FDD scanning process of building related data.
*'''Work Order Processes''' which include processes for relaying alerts and faults to users and managing the actions they undertake until the issue is resolved.
*'''Reporting Processes''' which involve tactical creation of visualization elements and reports or ad hoc querying processes for data mining and faults investigation.

==Applications==
Applications of integrated EFMS suites will benefit mostly organizations with either very large and busy facilities, such as malls, hotel complexes and transportation hubs the complexity of which challenges operational efficiency and organizations with many buildings dispersed across remote locations such as retail chains, restaurant chains, banks and food store chains which operate medium-sized buildings that stretch [[facility management]] operations to high costs.

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''''Esthesic''''' (UK ''aesthesic'') and '''''poietic''''' are terms used in [[semiotics]], the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], to describe perceptive and [[productive]] levels, processes, and analyses of [[symbol]]ic forms.

Like [[emic and etic|'emic' and 'etic']], both words appear to be derived from a suffix, ''-poietic'' (from {{lang-el|ποιητικός}} "creative") meaning productive or formative and ''-esthesic'' (from αἴσθησις "sense") being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the [[neutral level]]. The neutral level is the "trace" left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, "a symbolic form... is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process) that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.'"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Floor hockey''' is a family of indoor [[hockey]] games. 5 variations exist: three variations in the style of [[ice hockey]], and the other two in the style of [[bandy]], one of which is called [[floorball]] in English speaking regions.
Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as [[roller sports]] under the title of [[roller hockey]]. [[Quad hockey]] uses [[quad skates]] and looks similar to bandy, while [[inline hockey]] uses [[inline skates]] and is of the ice hockey variation.
All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a
curved end.&lt;ref&gt;“Floor Hockey Rules,” http://sportsvite.com/sports/FloorHockey/rules{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floor hockey games differ from [[street hockey]] in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=158|chapter=floor hockey|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bandy in a training format known as [[dryland training]].

==History==
Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Samuel Perry Jacks]], better known as "Sam Jacks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportshall.ca/stories.html?proID=491&amp;catID=all&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in [[Toronto]]. His achievement was later recognized by the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. “Ice Hockey”&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[ringette]] was introduced as a sport in the Winter [[Special Olympics]] in 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1970, the [[Special Olympics]] added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floor Hockey: Sport History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110631/http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|archive-date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|publisher= Special Olympics – Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Ball Hockey Association]] (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey.&lt;ref&gt;“Canadian Ball Hockey Association History,” The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.&lt;ref&gt;“CBHA Who We Are”, The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor [[Puck (sports)|puck]], a ring made of felt or other material ( [[Gym Ringette]] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard [[ice hockey]], field hockey or [[bandy]] sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.

==Variations==

One variation, especially popular in [[Europe]], is [[floorball]]. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

Another variation, [[cosom hockey]], uses plastic sticks and pucks, while [[gym ringette]] uses circular rings and sticks with no blade.

[[Power hockey]] is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs.
Knee pads are required for the goal keeper

== Rules ==

Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code.

With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into overtime in order to determine a winner.  Overtime rules vary, but typically include [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]].

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced.  A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a [[power play (sport)|power play]], but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
*  Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
*  Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player’s forward progress by pulling him or her back
*  Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body
*  Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
*  High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
*  Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
*  Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind

Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,&lt;ref name="nirsa.org"&gt;“NIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,” Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, http://www.nirsa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Sports/IntramuralRules/im_floorhockey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8145">'''Fritz Neugass''' (March 28, 1899, [[Mannheim]]–June 1979, [[New York City]]) was a German art critic and photographer.

==Early life==
Fritz Neugass was of Jewish origin. His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat specialist]] in [[Mannheim]]. Neugass took part in [[World War I]] in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement, he temporarily turned to [[Protestantism]]. 

==Art historian==
From 1919 he studied art history and archeology in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]], supervised by art historian [[Carl Neumann Degler|Carl Neumann]] (1860-1934) in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000584035 Neugass, F. (1927). Mittelalterliches chorgestühl in Deutschland. Strassburg: J. H. E. Heitz.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was a volunteer at the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutschen Archäologischen Institut]] (German Archaeological Institute) in [[Rome]] and then in [[Florence]] and participated in excavations on [[Sicily]]. 

==Photographer and journalist==
In 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], ''[[KUNST Magazin|Kunst]]'', and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current [[Paris]] art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including [[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with {{ill|Luise Straus-Ernst|de}}, first wife of [[Max Ernst]] (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Weissweiler, Eva | title=Notre Dame de Dada : Luise Straus-Ernst, das dramatische Leben der ersten Frau von Max Ernst | publication-date=2016 | publisher=Köln Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch | edition=1. Auflage | isbn=978-3-462-04894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.

Shortly after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Neugass was interned in the camp [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]]. In November 1939 he was transferred to [[Les Milles]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]]. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, [[Walter Hasenclever]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. In 1939, under the pseudonym "François Neuville" he wrote the novel ''Das Geheimnis um die Venus'' (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor [[Raimu]], which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.

As a journalist, he was accused by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via [[Casablanca]] and [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Life in the United States==
From 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for ''[[Popular Photography]].''&lt;ref&gt;Popular Photography, Dec 1949, Vol. 25, No. 6. pps 40-43&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for ''The American Annual of Photography''&lt;ref&gt;The American Annual of Photography, Volume 67, p.52ff Tennant and Ward, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', ''[[Aufbau]]'', and [[ARTnews|''Art News'']] and was the American correspondent to the Swiss [[Camera (magazine)|''Camera'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=49hTAAAAMAAJ Tom Maloney U.S. Camera Annual 1952, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt; in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz NEUGASS, “The photographers of the United Nations.” Camera, 1954, issue 9, page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Neugass became a member of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to [[Mexico]] to make [[Ethnology|ethnological]] photographic documentation of rural life&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Fritz+Neugass+Papers?q=neugass&amp;sort=archive_collection%2Cdate%2Ctitle%2Csubject&amp;os=0&amp;pgs=50 See University of Albany image search]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1954. His photography was featured by [[Edward Steichen]] in two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; ''Abstraction in Photography'', May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and [[The Family of Man|''The Family of Man'']] January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on [[Coney Island]] of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Givens, David B | author2=Center for Nonverbal Studies | title=The nonverbal dictionary of gestures, signs &amp; body language cues : from Adam's-apple-jump to zygomatic smile | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Center for Nonverbal Studies Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22295917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Neugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine ''Kunst''. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at [[Goethe-Institut, New York|Goethe House]] in New York City.

His estate is kept in the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meg.library.albany.edu:8443/archive/view?docId=ger007.xml Fritz Neugass Papers 1913-1979, M.E.

The '''George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eliava-institute.org/ George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Tbilisi Institute) has been active since the 1930s in the field of [[phage therapy]], which is used to combat microbial infection (cf. [[antibiotic-resistant]] strains).

== History ==
The institute was opened in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia in 1923, and was a [[bacteriology]] laboratory. Its founder, Prof. [[George Eliava]], was not aware of [[bacteriophage]]s until 1919-1921. In those years he met [[Felix d'Herelle]] during a visit to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]]. There, Eliava was enthusiastic about the potential of phages in the curing of bacterial disease, and invited d'Herelle to visit his laboratory in Georgia.

D'Herelle visited Tbilisi twice in 1933-34, and agreed to work with Prof. Eliava. It has been suggested that d'Herelle became enamored of the communist idea. In 1934, [[Joseph Stalin]] invited d'Herelle to the institute in Tbilisi; he accepted and worked there for about 18 months. D'Herelle dedicated one of his books to Stalin, ''The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Cure'', written and published in Tbilisi in 1935.

D'Herelle had planned to take up permanent residence in Tbilisi and had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the Institute; it would later house the [[KGB]]'s Georgian headquarters.

However, the collaboration between the two scientists was not to be. Around the time d'Herelle was to take up residence, in 1937 George Eliava was executed and denounced as an [[enemy of the people]]. D'Herelle fled from Tbilisi and, some believe, never returned. Another account states that he was in Paris at the time of Eliava's execution, and decided not to return. D'Herelle's book was also banned from distribution.

In spite of this development, the institute did not change its practical specialization, and continued its activity in the field of bacteriophage research.  In 1938, the Institute of Bacteriophage Research and the Institute of Microbiology &amp; Epidemiology (founded separately in 1936) merged, and the Institute of Microbiology, Epidemiology and Bacteriophage was formed.  It existed until 1951 and was authorized by the People's Commissary of Health of Georgia.  After 1951, it came under the auspices of the All-Union Ministry of Health and was renamed The Institute of Vaccine and Sera.

Since its inception, the institute was composed of a combination of industrial and scientific (research) departments. In 1988 the Institute was rearranged again and emerged as the Scientific Industrial Union "Bacteriophage" (SIU "Bacteriophage"). Around that time, its scientific portion was renamed the George Eliava Research Institute of Bacteriophage.

Based on the original intentions of D'Herelle and Eliava, the Bacteriophage Institute retained its leadership among other institutes of similar profile over the years. [[Teimuraz Chanishvili]] was the leader of the scientific part of the institute for over 30 years, until his death in August 2007.

== The institute behind the Iron Curtain ==

The institute in Tbilisi became a general Soviet institute for the development and production of bacteriophage drugs. Patients with serious infectious diseases came from all over the [[Soviet Union]] to receive treatments there. Bacteriophages became a routine part of treatment in clinics and hospitals. Ointments for the skin, and pills, drops, and rinses consisting of phages were sold and are still sold at pharmacies throughout [[Eastern Europe]] at low prices.

After the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] declined to join the [[Russian Federation]] and the [[Georgian Civil War]] broke out in 1991, the Tbilisi facility was essentially ruined. The Eliava Institute's facilities were damaged and decades of research on bacteriophage nearly went down the drain. Thousands of bacteriophage samples identified over the years and catalogued in huge, refrigerated "libraries" suffered irreversible damage due to frequent electrical outages. Apparently, the Russians transferred some of the equipment to their territory and built plants for the production of bacteriophages in other locations. Clearly, they recognized the importance of the research and also that of continued bacteriophage therapy. The situation at the Eliava Institute continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of closure.

However, in 1997, a report on the institute was broadcast by the [[BBC]], sparking a flurry of media interest in the [[Western Bloc|West]]. The headlines drew doctors and scientists to Tbilisi - and also, most importantly, energetic entrepreneurs from around the world who were determined to help save the institute and its stocks and fully explore the potential of this "new" and highly effective therapy. Georgian scientists whose names were connected in some way to the institute saw great opportunity, and some of them emigrated to the West to be part of joint projects. Some of the institute's projects with the rest of the world can be seen on the website of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, the umbrella entity which now includes the Eliava Institute.

Dr. Revaz Adamia is a present director of the Eliava Institute.

==Laboratories==

The Institute includes the following laboratories: Laboratory of Physiology of Microorganisms, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Laboratory of Morphology of Bacteriophages, Laboratory of Immunology (includes the group of Virology), Laboratory of Standardization and Deposing of Bacteriophages (includes the group of Brucella and Anaerobic Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Biotechnology and Gene Engineering (includes the group of Selection and Taxonomy of Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Microbial Ecology, and Laboratory for Genetics of Microorganisms and Bacteriophages.

==Features==

===Hypergraphia===
[[Hypergraphia]] is the tendency for extensive and compulsive writing or drawing, and has been observed in persons with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] who have experienced multiple seizures.&lt;ref name=Hypergraphia_repeated_seizures&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Tremont |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Smith |first2 = Megan M |last3 = Bauer |first3 = Lyndsey |last4 = Alosco |first4 = Michael L |last5 = Davis |first5 = Jennifer D |last6 = Blum |first6 = Andrew S |last7 = LaFrance |first7 = W Curt |title = Comparison of personality characteristics on the Bear-Fedio Inventory between patients with epilepsy and those with non-epileptic seizures. |journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11020039 |pages=47–52 |issue = 1 |volume = 24 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with hypergraphia display extreme attention to detail in their writing. Some such patients keep diaries recording meticulous details about their everyday lives. In certain cases, these writings demonstrate extreme interest in religious topics. Also, these individuals tend to have poor penmanship. The novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] showed symptoms of Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.&lt;ref name=DostoevskyEpilepsy&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Hughes |first = John R |title = The idiosyncratic aspects of the epilepsy of Fyodor Dostoevsky. |journal = [[Epilepsy &amp; Behavior]]|pages=531–8 |issue = 3 |volume = 7 |year = 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.07.021 |pmid=16194626}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=JK|last2=Robertson|first2=MM|last3=Trimble|first3=MR|title=The lateralising significance of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]]|date=February 1982|volume=45|issue=2|pages=131–8|doi=10.1136/jnnp.45.2.131|pmid=7069424|pmc=1083040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes morphing writing with drawing &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurology and General Medicine|last=Michael|first=Michael Jeffrey Aminoff|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumstantiality===
Individuals that demonstrate circumstantiality (or ''viscosity'') tend to continue conversations for a long time and talk receptively.&lt;ref name=Circumstiantiality_TLE&gt;{{Cite book |last = Devinsky |first = Orrin |author2=Vorkas, Charles |author3=Barr, William |title = Psychiatric Issues in Epilepsy: A Practical Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |date = 2006 |isbn = 078178591X |chapter = Personality disorders in epilepsy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensified Mental Life===
Individuals may demonstrate an intensified mental life, including deepened cognitive and emotional responses. This tendency may pair with hypographia, leading to prolific creative output and a tendency toward intense, solitary pursuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8435">'''Günter Ropohl''' (14 June 1939 in [[Cologne]], Germany – 28 January 2017) was a German philosopher of technology.

== Biography ==
Günter Ropohl studied [[mechanical engineering]] and philosophy at [[Stuttgart]] University, where he was a scholar of the philosopher [[Max Bense]]. After his PhD ([[Dr.-Ing.]]) in 1970, he wrote his [[Habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy und Sociology at [[Karlsruhe University]] 1978 under the supervision of [[Hans Lenk (philosopher)|Hans Lenk]]. His work dealt with the [[systems theory]] of "[[Technik]]" (engl. ''technique''), leading to the concept of [[general technology]].&lt;ref&gt;published under the title ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'' 1979, 2nd. ed. under the title ''Allgemeine Technologie'', 1999, 3rd ed. 2009, open source: [http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/1000011529]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1979, Ropohl became Professor at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]. Soon after, in 1981, he became Professor for [[Allgemeine Technologie]] (general technology) and [[philosophy of technology]] at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany (until 2004). In the 1980s, he visited his colleague and friend [[Carl Mitcham]] in the United States. From 1983 to 1991, i.e. during the period of the [[Cold War]], he was course director and visiting lecturer at the Inter-University Centre Dubrovnik ([[Croatia]]). In 1988, he was invited as visiting professor at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], Rochester NY.
Ropohl was an honorary member of the German Engineering Association ([[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]]), due to his interdisciplinary engagement for the philosophy of technology. He was co-editor of an anthology of the ''classics'' in the philosophy of technology in a Continental-European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;* Hubig, Ch., Huning, A. and Ropohl, G. (Eds.), ''Nachdenken über Technik. Die Klassiker der Technikphilosophie'', Berlin 2000. 3rd ed. 2013 (to be translated into English and Chinese in the next years).&lt;/ref&gt; Ropohl published 15 monographs, (co-)edited another 15 books and published more than 180 articles. He died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwerk-rauchen.de/component/content/article/1-aktuelle-nachrichten/975-guenter-ropohl-verstorben.html Günter Ropohl verstorben] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

A central concept in his work was [[sociotechnical systems]], i.e. he regarded techniques as societal structures. Ropohl was a critic of the systems theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]] and voted for the recognition of [[material culture]]. His definition of (''German'') "Technik" included a) the [[utility]], b) artificiality and c) [[Function (engineering)|functionality]]. In the focus of his work is the combination of technique as [[Document|artefact]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]], whereas [[knowledge]] insinuates the meta-concept of [[technology]]. Therefore, he differentiated between [[engineering sciences]] and [[technical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter Ropohl, ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'', 1979, p. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ropohl was well known in the German-speaking academia for his writings on the concepts of ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'', the [[ethics of technology]], [[technology assessment]], professional ethics for engineers and on the societal need for educating towards technology literacy.

He received a [[Festschrift]] with contributions from academic scholars, focusing on his work and related discourses, both on his 65th and 75th birthday (edited by [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], see literature), including a complete list of his publications from the late 1960s to 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43928">'''[[Optics]]''' began with the development of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Mesopotamia]]ns, followed by theories on light and [[Visual perception|vision]] developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], and the development of [[geometrical optics]] in the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The word ''[[optics]]'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''τα ὀπτικά'' meaning "appearance, look".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology|year=1996|author=T. F. Hoad|isbn=0-19-283098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in [[early modern Europe]], where [[Diffraction|diffractive optics]] began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as "classical optics". The term "modern optics" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as [[Physical optics|wave optics]] and [[quantum optics]].

==Early history==

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the [[Nimrud lens|Nimrud / Layard lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 |title=The Nimrud lens / the Layard lens |publisher=The British Museum |work=Collection database |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses. However, glass lenses were not thought of until the [[Middle Ages]].

Some lenses fixed in ancient Egyptian statues are much older than those mentioned above. There is some doubt as to whether or not they qualify as lenses, but they are undoubtedly glass and served at least ornamental purposes. The statues appear to be anatomically correct schematic eyes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In [[Science and technology in ancient India|ancient India]], the philosophical schools of [[Samkhya]] and [[Vaisheshika]], from around the 6th&amp;ndash;5th century BC, developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements.

In contrast, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic [[atom]]s are those of earth (''prthivı''), water (''apas''), fire (''tejas''), and air (''vayu''), that should not be confused with the ordinary meaning of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms. Around the first century BC, the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as "the seven rays of the sun".

In the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sarton |first=G |year=1993 |title=Ancient science through the golden age of Greece |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&amp;pg=PA248 |page=248 |publisher=[[Courier Dover]] |isbn=978-0-486-27495-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] observed that "things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Ptolemy]].

In 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek [[atomism|atomists]], wrote:

{{quote|The light and heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.|Lucretius|''On the nature of the Universe''{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}}}

Despite being similar to later particle theories of light, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted and light was still theorized as emanating from the eye.

In his ''Catoptrica'', [[Hero of Alexandria]] showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.

In the second century [[Claudius Ptolemy]],  in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' undertook studies of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]].  He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, and his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the [[angle of refraction]] is proportional to the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.E.R. | authorlink = G.

The Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dignāga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of [[atomism]] that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, similar to the modern concept of [[photon]]s, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles.

===Geometrical optics===
{{See also|Geometrical optics|Ray (optics)}}

The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer [[Euclid]] (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms.

# Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object.
# Those lines falling upon an object form a cone.
# Those things upon which the lines fall are seen.
# Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger.
# Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher.
# Right and left rays appear right and left.
# Things seen within several angles appear clearer.

Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance.

Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. AD 10–70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics).  Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This has come to be known as [[Emission theory (vision)|''emission theory'']].&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2015|title=Two Millennia of Light: The Long Path to Maxwell’s Waves|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=54–56+60|doi=10.1109/MIE.2015.2421754|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer.  On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror.  Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror.

Like Hero, [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' (preserved only in the form of a Latin translation of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.  Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density.  He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 16; A. M. Smith, Ptolemy's search for a law of refraction: a case-study in the classical methodology of 'saving the appearances' and its limitations, ''Arch. Hist. Exact Sci''. 26 (1982), 221-240; Ptolemy's procedure is reported in the fifth chapter of his ''Optics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His tabulated results have been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the outliers are distorted to represent Ptolemy's ''a priori'' model of the nature of refraction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==In the Islamic world==
[[File:Ibn Sahl manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|Reproduction of a page of [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as [[Snell's law]].]]

[[Al-Kindi]] (c. 801–873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].  In a work known in the west as ''De radiis stellarum'', al-Kindi developed a theory "that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG|thumb|The [[Circle#Theorems|theorem of Ibn Haytham]]]] This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David C.|last=Lindberg|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=62|issue=4|date=Winter 1971|pages=469–489 [471]|doi=10.1086/350790|title=Alkindi's Critique of Euclid's Theory of Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on [[Optics (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Optics'']]. His treatise  ''Fī al-'āla al-muḥriqa'' "On the burning instruments" was recontructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Rashed, R., ''Géométrie et dioptrique au Xe siècle: Ibn Sahl, al-Quhi et Ibn al-Haytham.'' Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1993
&lt;/ref&gt; The work is concerned with how [[curved mirror]]s and [[lens (optics)|lens]]es bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of [[refraction]] mathematically equivalent to [[Snell's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashed | first1 = R. | year = 1990 | title = A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 464–91 | doi=10.1086/355456}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in as ''Alhacen'' or ''Alhazen'' in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's ''Optics''. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindberg | first1 = D. C. | year = 1967 | title = Alhazen's Theory of Vision and its Reception in the West | url = | journal = Isis | volume = 58 | issue = | page = 322 | doi=10.1086/350266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn al-Haytham's key achievement was twofold: first, to insist, against the opinion of Ptolemy, that vision occurred because of rays entering the eye; the second was to define the physical nature of the rays discussed by earlier geometrical optical writers, considering them as the forms of light and color.&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air." – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''', as cited by Samuel Sambursky (1974), ''Physical thought from the Pre-socratics to the quantum physicists'' &lt;/ref&gt;  
He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics.  He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al Manazir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), translated into [[Latin]] as the ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectiva'', which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 58-86; [[Nader El-Bizri]] 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189–218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;

[[Avicenna]] (980-1037) agreed with Alhazen that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as he "observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the [[speed of sound]].&lt;ref name=Biruni&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh]], who lived in [[Al-Andalus]] during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as ''Liber de crepisculis'', which was mistakenly attributed to [[Alhazen]]. This was a "short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning [[twilight]] and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays." Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Authorship of the Liber de crepusculis, an Eleventh-Century Work on Atmospheric Refraction|first=A.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236–1311) and his student [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. Al-Fārisī published his findings in his ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name="Gazi"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hüseyin Gazi |last=Topdemir |title=Kamal Al-Din Al-Farisi's Explanation of the Rainbow |journal=Humanity &amp; Social Sciences Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 [83] |year=2007 |url=http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002144913/http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medieval Europe==

The English bishop, [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253), wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval [[university]] and the recovery of the works of Aristotle.  Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new [[Aristotelianism]], hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings.  He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an [[epistemology]] of light, a [[metaphysics]] or [[cosmogony]] of light, an [[etiology]] or [[physics]] of light, and a [[theology]] of light.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval "big bang" theory.  Both his biblical commentary, the ''Hexaemeron'' (1230 x 35), and his scientific ''On Light'' (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:3, "God said, let there be light", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Southern, ''Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 136-9, 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optics from Roger Bacon's De multiplicatone specierum.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, ''De multiplicatione specierum'')]]

His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his ''On Lines, Angles, and Figures'' where he asserts that "a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient" and in ''On the Nature of Places'' where he notes that "every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures."&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1214–1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light.  In his optical writings (the ''Perspectiva'', the ''De multiplicatione specierum'', and the ''De speculis comburentibus'') he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhacen]], [[Aristotle]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Kindi]], [[Ptolemy]], Tideus, and [[Constantine the African]].  Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen.  But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (''species'') by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those ''species''.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, "Roger Bacon on Light, Vision, and the Universal Emanation of Force", pp. 243-275 in Jeremiah Hackett, ed., ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'', (Leiden: Brill, 1997), pp. 245-250; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 107-18; ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1992, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that Bacon's optical use of the term "''species''" differs significantly from the [[Species#Historical development of the species concept|genus / species]] categories found in Aristotelian philosophy.

Several later works, including the influential ''A Moral Treatise on the Eye'' (Latin: ''Tractatus Moralis de Oculo'') by [[Peter of Limoges]] (1240–1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World: Optics, Theology and Religious Life|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|author=Dallas G. Denery II|page=75-80|isbn=9781139443814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English Franciscan, [[John Pecham]] (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on Optics of the Middle Ages, the ''Perspectiva communis''.  His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color.  Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''John Pecham and the Science of Optics:'' Perspectiva communis, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1970), pp. 12-32; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 116-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his predecessors, [[Witelo]] (c. 1230–1280 x 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the ''Perspectiva''.  His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of ''species'', although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas.  Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 118-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodoric of Freiberg]] (ca. 1250–ca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Gazi" /&gt; as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311) and his student Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1260–1320) mentioned above.

==Renaissance and Early Modern==

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (''The Optical Part of Astronomy''). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies.  ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp 142–146&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willebrord Snellius]] (1580–1626) found the mathematical law of [[refraction]], now known as [[Snell's law]], in 1621. Subsequently, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tipler|first=P. A. and G. Mosca|year=2004|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|location= |publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=0-7167-4389-2|page= 1068|oclc=51095685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently discovered the [[law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwquAJtW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the ''Opera reliqua'' (also known as ''Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma'') and the ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] could decompose [[White|white light]] into a [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of colours, and that a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Isaac Newton's early life and achievements#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]]. From this work he concluded that any refracting [[telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]]) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes ''On Colour'', which he later expanded into his ''Opticks''. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or ''corpuscles'' and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [[wave]]s to explain the [[diffraction]] of light (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]] and the idea of [[wave-particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posited]] the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dobbs |first=J.T. |date=December 1982 |title=Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter |journal=Isis |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=523 |doi=10.1086/353114}} quoting ''Opticks''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffractive optics===
[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction, which he presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1803]]

The effects of [[diffraction]] of light were carefully observed and characterized by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who also coined the term ''diffraction'', from the Latin ''diffringere'', 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Memoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts | author = Jean Louis Aubert | publisher = Impr. de S.

[[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638&amp;ndash;1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first [[diffraction grating]]. In 1803 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his [[Young's Double Slit Interferometer|double slit interferometer]]. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.

==Lenses and lensmaking==
{{See also|Timeline of telescope technology}}

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the Layard / [[Nimrud lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud/&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses.

The earliest historical reference to [[magnification]] dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] in the 5th century BC, which depict "simple glass meniscal [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]". The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when [[Seneca the Younger]], a tutor of Emperor [[Nero]], wrote: "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water".&lt;ref name=Kriss&gt;{{citation|last1=Kriss|first1=Timothy C.|last2=Kriss|first2=Vesna Martich|title=History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=42|issue=4|pages=899–907|date=April 1998|doi=10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116|pmid=9574655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the [[gladiator|gladiatorial games]] using an [[emerald]] as a corrective lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+37.16 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]], [[Lens (optics)|concave lenses]], and [[magnifying glass]]es in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref name="Kriss"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{Harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{Harv|Elliott|1966}}{{rp|Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bacon]] used parts of glass spheres as [[magnifying glass]]es and recommended them to be used to help people read. Roger Bacon got his inspiration from [[Alhacen]] in the 11th century. He discovered that light reflects from objects rather than emanating from them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Between the 11th and 13th century "[[reading stone]]s" were invented. Often used by [[monk]]s to assist in [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] manuscripts, these were primitive [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|plano-convex lenses]] initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses [[magnification|magnified]] more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses were made, although it is unclear who the inventor was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|date=2007-01-01|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=|isbn=9780871692597|location=|pages=4–6|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known working telescopes were the [[refracting telescope]]s that appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: [[Hans Lippershey]] applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]] two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] greatly improved upon these designs the following year. [[Isaac Newton]] is credited with constructing the first functional [[reflecting telescope]] in 1668,  his [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]].

The earliest known examples of compound microscopes, which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] near the specimen with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]], appeared in Europe around 1620.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Douglas B.|last2=Davidson|first2=Michael W.|title=Fundamentals of light microscopy and electronic imaging|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0471692140|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the [[Netherlands]] including claims it was invented in 1590 by [[Zacharias Janssen]] and/or his father, Hans Martens,&lt;ref&gt;claim made by Zacharias Janssen's son in 1655&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Norman Lockyer|title=Nature Volume 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaNFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Zacharias+Janssen+Inventor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix6aKoqpjTAhXlJMAKHXTaDQoQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Zacharias%20Janssen%20Inventor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=32–36, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/39649-who-invented-the-microscope.html|title=Who Invented the Microscope? |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims it was invented by [[expatriate]] [[Cornelis Drebbel]] who was noted to have a version in London in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Jorink|title=Reading the Book of Nature in the Dutch Golden Age, 1575-1715|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAiEMHlll9QC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=compound+microscope+Cornelis+Drebbel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=compound%20microscope%20Cornelis%20Drebbel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]] (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J.

== Quantum optics ==
{{Main|Quantum optics}}

Light is made up of particles called [[photons]] and hence inherently is quantized.  Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from [[Max Planck]] in 1899 when he correctly modelled [[blackbody radiation]] by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light.&lt;ref name="Cropper2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. Cropper|title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231–236}} In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of the [[photoelectric effect]]. It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, [[Niels Bohr]] showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and [[matter]] following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of [[atom physics]] and [[quantum electronics]].

This changed with the invention of the [[maser]] in 1953 and the [[laser]] in 1960. [[Laser science]]—research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name ''quantum optics'' became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in [[quantum field theory]], [[George Sudarshan]], [[Roy J. Glauber]], and [[Leonard Mandel]] applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the [[statistical mechanics|statistics]] of light (see [[degree of coherence]]). This led to the introduction of the [[coherent state]] as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, [[H. Jeff Kimble|Kimble]] et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time.  Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezed light]], was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser pulses—created by [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("[[ultrafast]]") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. [[Raman spectroscopy]]) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an [[optical trap]] or [[optical tweezers]] by laser beam. This, along with [[Doppler cooling]] was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated [[Bose–Einstein condensation]].

Other remarkable results are the [[Bell test experiments|demonstration of quantum entanglement]], [[quantum teleportation]], and (recently, in 1995) [[quantum logic gate]]s. The latter are of much interest in [[quantum information theory]], a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical [[computer science]].

Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include [[parametric down-conversion]], [[Optical parametric oscillator|parametric oscillation]], even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for [[quantum information]], manipulation of single atoms, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called [[atom optics]]), and much more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25184">The '''imaging of cultural heritage''' is a necessary part of long term preservation of [[cultural heritage]]. While the physical conditions of objects will change over time, imaging serves as a way to document and represent heritage in a moment in time of the life of the item. Different methods of imaging produce results that are applicable in various circumstances. Not every method is appropriate for every object, and not every object needs to be imaged by multiple methods. In addition to preservation and conservation related concerns, imaging can also serve to enhance research and study of cultural heritage.

== Purpose ==
One reason for imaging objects is to make the items available for study and scholarship without incurring unnecessary harm to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betterlight.com/downloads/whitePaper/wp_museum_lighting.pdf|title=Light Exposure to Sensitive Artworks during Digital Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=6|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing images to scholars, images can also be added to online catalogs and databases to increase the size of the audience interacting with the objects and allow them to view the item with no added risk.

Another reason is for documentary purposes, especially as it relates to conservation. According to the American Institute for Conservation, “Documentation is basic to the ethical practice of conservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging prior to conservation allows conservators to record the current state of the object, which can then be compared to later images following conservation. This allows someone in the future to look back and see the ways in which an item was impacted by conservation. Images taken over different periods of time can also reveal changes in condition and can be used to minimize damage going forward. The [[American Institute for Conservation]]'s Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation is a useful reference guide for the application of digital imaging to the field of conservation. It details guidelines for equipment, techniques, and practices that are in line with best practices for conservation. This covers everything from suggestions for types of cameras and memory cards to discussing processing details and how to apply metadata.

An additional purpose is found in the way imaging enhances scholarship. Different types of imaging can reveal materials and techniques used in creating an object that are not immediately evident with the naked eye.

== Methods ==
There are many methods that are employed in imaging. These may include different types of lighting as well as the use of radiography.  Multiple energy levels and technologies have been used for cultural heritage imaging, including imaging mummy masks with multiple spectral bands of light, different x-ray technologies, optical coherence tomography, and terahertz imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/technologies|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases: Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographing objects under standard conditions is a typical practice to preserve the item in perpetuity, but not every object will need more specialized imaging. Those doing the imaging or requesting the imaging be done will look at each object on a case by case basis to determine the usefulness of specialized imaging. In some cases combinations of different types of imaging will be more effective than one type on its own. This can be seen in projects like the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty]]'s conservation of Guercino’s ''Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/conservators-get-to-know-guercinos-jacob-blessing-the-sons-of-joseph/|title=Conservators Get to Know Guercino's Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Getty's APPEAR project, details of which can be found on a blog by the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/appear-project/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photography ===
[[Photography]] under normal illumination will produce a record of the appearance of an object in standard conditions. Standard conditions typically mean uniform illumination with minimal glare. In conservation, these images will serve as a "before treatment" record. They can also serve as a catalog image for in-house use or an online collection. Following a standard image capture, subsequent images can be taken under various conditions to highlight areas that need treatment or closer monitoring.

==== Raking illumination ====

''Further information:[[Raking light]]''
[[File:Early Bronze Age, Arreton Type Developed Flat Axehead (FindID 139019-194932).jpg|left|thumb|Raking light allows the viewer to see hammering scars that are not evident in standard lighting conditions.]]
Raking illumination highlights texture on the surface of an object. This is achieved by using a single light source at a low angle relative to the object. Images taken under these conditions can reveal deviations in the surface of an object – gouges, scratches, paint loss, bulges, and more. With archaeological objects this may reveal how tools were made or how food was processed (e.g. cut marks on bones). In paintings it can show how the artist used the paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief|title=Raking light and relief|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specular illumination ====

Specular illumination documents the surface sheen of an object. With paintings, it is used to highlight areas of abnormality. While raking illumination will produce a record of these abnormalities with greater clarity, specular illumination is less dependent on the orientation of the light. There are two basic set ups for specular illumination – axial and oblique. An axial setup requires the camera and the light source to be on the same axis. The camera is parallel to the surface of the object, and the light source is next to the camera. An oblique setup requires the camera and the light source to be on opposite sides of the subject, but each are at the same angle relative to the object. Specular light can allow conservators to see tool marks on wooden objects, or indentations that seemed invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/about/services/photographicservices/lightingtechniques|title=Lighting Techniques|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transmitted illumination ====

[[File:US Navy 040924-N-6213R-038 Intelligence Specialist 2nd Class Damon Jenkins of Los Angeles, Calif., reviews aerial reconnaissance imagery on a light table in the Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC).jpg|thumb|Transmitted illumination is similar to the effects of a light table or lightbox on a two dimensional object. |201x201px]]
Transmitted illumination is used to highlight thickness and losses among other things. Transmitted illumination uses a light source that is behind the object being photographed. (For two dimensional objects this has a very similar function to a light table.) This “back lighting” provides a way to see things like cracks and holes as well as revealing the general structure of an item. With something like papyrus, it can help to reveal the condition of the individual fibers. It can also be useful with textiles or basketry items where a tight weave may make it difficult to see damage or clues about how the item was woven.

=== Infrared Photography ===
[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|left|thumb]]
[[Infrared photography]] has been used in conservation since the 1930s. In art the most well-known application is being able to see underdrawings of paintings or changes in composition. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s the Blue Room is a famous example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colourlex.com/project/ir-reflectography/|title=Infrared Reflectography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to enhance legibility of manuscripts and inscriptions, as seen with the Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/?locale=en_US|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Dunhuang Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/papers/infrared/index.html|title=Infrared Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon black ink tends to show up very well under infrared.

=== Ultraviolet Photography ===
[[Ultraviolet photography]] is frequently used for differentiation and characterization of materials. Ultraviolet radiation can cause materials to emit fluorescence that can be seen and photographed. The intensity and color of the fluorescence is influenced by the amount of material, the types of materials, and the amount of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV radiation can also reveal things not visible to the naked eye. Codex Sinaiticus contains the oldest, complete copy of the New Testament. On the last page of the Gospel of John UV radiation shows that the final sentence was added later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Edition of the New Testament|last=Trobisch|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the implications for this are rooted in biblical scholarship, this shows that there is more to manuscripts than what is found at the surface level. In conservation this shows that with UV radiation even the “invisible” becomes part of the record for the object and must be documented and monitored.

With paintings, UV can reveal where prior restorations have occurred. The varnish on top of a painting is usually more fluorescent than the pigments. If there is paint on top of a varnish, the conservator knows that there has been some restoration in the past. UV can also help to reveal materials used in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/ultra-violet-light|title=Ultra-violet light|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) ===
[[File:ArPalimTyp2.jpg|left|thumb|The original text of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] can be seen after imaging.|343x343px]]
A [[Multispectral image]] is an image with capture points across the light spectrum. Different wavelengths of light are separated by filters or illuminated with narrow bands of light. These filters can also be combined with different colors of light as well as IR and UV to produce different results and fluorescence. MSI has been used in several major projects regarding ancient manuscripts. Not only is this useful for making these texts legible and available, but these images are useful for conservation. By recording things that are not easily seen, MSI helps conservators to be aware of what they couldn’t see and allows them to monitor these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in examples of paintings like the Mummy Portraits. The Penn Museum has shown through MSI that one of their portraits has an outline of the figure etched in the paint. This is something that was not visible under standard conditions, and something they didn't notice on other portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/2016/01/15/appear-project-multispectral-imaging-on-the-fayum-mummy-portraits/|title=APPEAR Project – Multispectral Imaging on the Fayum Mummy Portraits|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSI also helps scholars to be able to read previously illegible texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest (further discussed below) is a famous example of this, but many other [[palimpsest]]s have been rendered legible by this process. Multiple groups, institutions and companies work to image manuscripts using MSI and other methods to digitally preserve them, make them accessible to scholars, and improve legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/bitstreams/2017/04/24/multispectral-imaging-whats-good/|title=Multispectral Imaging, What's It Good For?|website=Duke University Libraries|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) ===
[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] can help reveal layers and 3D visualizations of text in various media, including papyrus and paper. It has been used with multispectral imaging to provide more information about text and ink on different layers of an object. This has been used in research into papyrus mummy mask cartonnage to 
image  small  areas  of  cartonnage in conjunction with narrowband multispectral imaging to reveal ink layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/pubs/ISTMummy_OCT_MSI.pdf|title=Integrating Optical Imaging of Mummy Mask Cartonnage|website=|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) ===
[[Reflectance Transformation Imaging]] uses special procedures to create a [[Polynomial texture mapping|polynomial texture map]] of an object. These PTMs are created from a set of images using a stationary camera and a single source of light that can be held in different positions.

The following is quoted from Cultural Heritage Imaging's website:

"RTI images are created from information derived from multiple digital photographs of a subject shot from a stationary camera position. In each photograph, light is projected from a different known, or knowable, direction. This process produces a series of images of the same subject with varying highlights and shadows. Lighting information from the images is mathematically synthesized to generate a mathematical model of the surface, enabling a user to re-light the RTI image interactively and examine its surface on a screen.

Each RTI resembles a single, two-dimensional (2D) photographic image. Unlike a typical photograph, reflectance information is derived from the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the image subject and encoded in the image per pixel, so that the synthesized RTI image “knows” how light will reflect off the subject. When the RTI is opened in RTI viewing software, each constituent pixel is able to reflect the software's interactive “virtual” light from any position selected by the user. This changing interplay of light and shadow in the image discloses fine details of the subject's 3D surface form.

RTI was invented by Tom Malzbender and Dan Gelb, research scientists at Hewlett-Packard Labs. A landmark paper describing these first tools and methods, named Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM), was published in 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/|title=Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI): What is it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI has several applications for cultural heritage. In many instances PTMs can improve the legibility of inscriptions, such as metal amulets whose inscriptions have been obscured by corrosion. PTMs have also been found to be useful in analyzing ceramics and paintings. Cracks and pitting that wasn't visible under standard conditions became visible using RTI. The Tate and the National Gallery investigated the use of PTMs and determined that they could be viable alternatives to raking light; especially since PTMs were found to be more easily replicated than raking light photographs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=E.M.|title=Imaging Techniques in Conservation|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=17–29|doi=10.5334/jcms.1021201|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With manuscripts RTI can highlight the shape and structure of pages. While these pages are typically viewed as two dimensional items, RTI makes them three dimensional and shows that there is more than just a flat page. This is helpful for legibility (for scholars) and for condition (for conservators). Scholars can see the text more clearly and may even be able to see text that was erased. This is especially true in conditions where the ink "ate" letter-shaped holes into the page surface. Conservators can use the PTMs to determine the degree of damage to the surface, as cracks, buckling, and holes become much more pronounced.

=== Radiography ===
{{see|Radiography of cultural objects}}
[[Radiography]] is a non-destructive analysis of the internal structure of an object, that uses x-rays to create an image. For paintings this means that conservators can potentially see the inner structure of the painting and learn about the materials and techniques used by the original artist. Radiography can also be used on archaeological objects or sculptures to learn more about the internal structure of the items that would otherwise be invisible without destroying the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/45/086/45086050.pdf|title=Application of Digital Radiography in the Analysis of Cultural Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging produces a two-dimensional image of the inner workings of the item. X-ray technology has been used to read the damaged [[Herculaneum papyri|Herculaneum Papyri]] as opposed to trying to unroll the scroll to read its contents. As part of a conservation measure on the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] x-rays were created to better understand how the piece was painted and put together. Images from that project can be viewed on the [http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/#intro Closer to Van Eyck website]. On the Penn [https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/x-radiography/ Museum's Artifact Lab blog] there are multiple entries discussing the applications of radiography on cultural heritage.

[[CT scan|CT Scan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s create a three-dimensional image from many 2-D radiographic images. This produces cross sections of images and allows for the isolation of layers. Like the 2-D images, this allows for a look at the inner sections of objects without causing damage. CT scans have been used on mummies (more similar to traditional medical uses of CT scans) as well as other objects, like cuneiform tablets. CT scans have also been used on papyrus scrolls to digitally unroll them - allowing for them to be read, but not causing any harm. The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London has used CT scans to take images of some of their specimens and create 3D models. This is a much less invasive technique than the traditional model of molding and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of these applications have the goal of being as noninvasive as possible while still trying to gather as much information as possible.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is a technique used in radiology that does not use x-rays. It is mainly used in medical imaging to generate images of the organs of the body. It can also be applied to deceased individuals. For example, a female burial from Novosibirsk, Russia was found to have suffered from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/2628-141016-ukok-princess-cancer|title=MRI Shows 'Princess Ukok' Suffered From Breast Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging allows for a noninvasive analysis of past individuals to help scientists better understand past human ancestors.

== Examples ==
There are hundreds and possibly thousands of examples of projects that use noninvasive imaging techniques. Highlighted here are several that are more commonly known.

=== Archimedes Palimpsest ===
[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|left|thumb|Archimedes Palimpsest]]
The [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] is a parchment manuscript that contains writings from two different time periods. In the 13th century monks erased and wrote over a 10th century copy of some works originally written by Archimedes. Through a combination of different imaging techniques (MSI, raking illumination and X-ray fluorescence) and various processing procedures the older layer became legible.

=== Syriac Galen Palimpsest ===
The Syriac Galen Palimpsest is a parchment manuscript with an early translation of the Greek medical philosopher Galen of Pergamon overwritten with psalms for days of the week.  MSI and later x-ray fluorescence were used to reveal the undertext of Galen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/medicines-hidden-roots-in-an-ancient-manuscript.html|title=Medicine's Hidden Roots in an Ancient Manuscript|website=New York Times|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian mummies ===
With the use of imaging technologies, research can be conducted on mummies without having to unwrap them. A 2014 exhibition at the British Museum highlighted these imaging techniques in conjunction with the eight mummies that were imaged. The CT scans produced allow for a digital layer by layer look at the burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ancient_lives,_new_discoveries.aspx?fromShortUrl|title=Eight mummies|website=British Museum|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummy masks have been studied with six different imaging technologies in a global project involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the feasibility of using non-destructive digital imaging technology to make texts visible in images of papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform tablets and envelopes ===
CT scanners have been used to look at cuneiform tablets layer by layer in order to reproduce them with a 3D printer. This has been done at Cornell University and at TU Delft (“Scanning for Syria”) where scans were done of silicon molds rather than original tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/en/research/stories-of-science/geoscience-engineering/scanning-for-syria/|title=Scanning for Syria|website=Delft University of Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a presentation titled, “Using CT to Image and 3D print Cuneiform Tablets without Removing Them from Their Envelopes,” at the ASOR annual meeting in 2016 Dr. Andrew Shortland discussed how his team had figured out a way to isolate the inner tablet from the envelope and read what was on it without breaking the outer, envelope layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asor.org/am/2016/documents/2016%20ASOR%20Program%20Book.pdf|title=ASOR Program Guide 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian Democracy sidebar |expanded=all}}
[[Jacques Maritain]], the French Catholic philosopher and author of over 60 books, advocated what he called "Integral Christian Humanism". He argued that [[secular]] forms of [[humanism]] were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person.

Once the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] dimension of [[human]] nature is rejected, Maritain has argued that we no longer have an integral, but merely partial, humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in Integral Humanism he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways [[Christianity]] could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. [[Maritain]]'s political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] movement.

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

'''La plume de ma tante''' ({{lang-fr|"my aunt's quill"}}) is a phrase in popular culture, attributed to elementary French language instruction (possibly as early as the 19th century&lt;ref name="TeschnerEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard V. Teschner|author2=Eston Earl Evans|title=Analyzing the Grammar of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fij1OwTBS4EC&amp;pg=RA2-PA9|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=15 May 2007|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-166-3|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and used as an example of grammatically correct phrases with limited practical application that are sometimes taught in introductory foreign language texts. As [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] said in 1958, "As every student knows, the most idiotically useless phrase in a beginner's French textbook is ''la plume de ma tante'' (the pen of my aunt)."&lt;ref name="Inc1958"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frisky French Fun on Broadway|journal=Life|date=8 December 1958|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is also used to refer to something deemed completely irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Beeby-Lonsdale1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allison Beeby-Lonsdale|title=Teaching Translation from Spanish to English: Worlds Beyond Words|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=978-0-7766-0399-5|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lent its name to the musical play ''[[La Plume de Ma Tante]]'', which won a [[Tony Award]] in 1959.

The phrase is also used in teaching and remembering the sounds of the French vowel ''a''; '''La plume de ma tante''' contains three instances of ''a'' that use two different pronunciations. Other limited-use phrases used as pronunciation guides include: '''Le petit bébé est un peu malade''' ({{lang-fr|"the little baby is slightly ill"}}), which contains six variants of ''e'', and '''Un bon vin blanc''' ({{lang-fr|"a good white wine"}}), which contains four nasal vowels.

The phrase's French converse is [[:fr:My tailor is rich|''my tailor is rich'']], the first in the original English [[Assimil]] guide.

In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', [[Linda Blair]]'s character utters the phrase as she is possessed. In 1982, [[Del Boy]] from the TV show ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' says it to a policewoman in the first episode of the second season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4661">The '''Laboratory of Nano and Quantum Engineering''' (LNQE) is an interdisciplinary research center for [[nanotechnology]] of the [[University of Hanover]] in Germany.

== Goals ==
The Laboratory of Nano and Quantum Engineering (LNQE) is an interdisciplinary research center of the Leibniz Universität Hannover in the field of nanotechnology. Substantive goals are both excellent basic research as well as application-oriented engineering at the nanoscale accompanied by appropriate cross-disciplinary training. To achieve its objectives the LNQE has its own research building in Hanover, with laboratories, equipment, etc., and especially clean rooms.

== Members ==
The LNQE comprises 27 research groups from physics, chemistry and engineering of the Leibniz University of Hanover. It is led at least by an executive board of four members which nominate a speaker from their middle. The executive board is supported by the LNQE-Office.

== Research ==
The collective term nanotechnology describes the study and manipulation of objects at smallest sizes. In general, the nanotechnology deals with structures ranging in size from 1-100 nanometers in at least one spatial direction. 100 nanometers are roughly one-thousandth of the diameter of a normal human hair. With these small dimensions surface properties come to the fore compared with the bulk properties of materials and also often quantum effects has to be taken into account. Nanotechnology is the technology of small things with new features and functionalities. 

Nano engineering is the engineering on the nanoscale, i.e., the selective artificial fabrication of nanotechnology structures such as tiny transistors on computer chips. With nano engineering the closely related term quantum engineering aims to produce and manipulate a defined quantum state, such as the realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate or an electronic device with adjusted electron spin. The size of such systems is also often in the nanometer range. 

Nanomaterials of various shapes, composition and size in the nanometer range are produced and analyzed in the laboratory. Nanoparticles have due to their small size special chemical and physical properties that differ significantly from the properties of macroscopic particles and solids. The cause therefore is the large ratio of surface to volume of the nanoparticles, so that they strongly interact with their environment. Added where appropriate quantum mechanical effects. 

The artificially created structures and materials are investigated in a wide variety and analyzed. The analysis in the nanometer range requires variety and latest equipment and techniques. The necessary technological equipment is centrally located in the LNQE research building and is complemented by the equipment in the institutions.

'''Landscape-scale conservation''' is a holistic approach to conservation, concerned with [[biodiversity]] and local economies, agriculture, [[eco-tourism]], [[geodiversity]] and the health and social benefits of the environment. Landscape-scale conservation has arisen in response to the challenges of [[climate change]] and a perceived excessive focus on [[site based conservation]].

==Island biogeography==
From an ecological perspective the principles of the approach owe much to the application of [[island biogeography]]. Key reservoirs of biodiversity in the landscape are identified (including designated sites). Opportunities to link, complement or expand these sites are sought with the emphasis on the role of natural processes in their management.

Among the leading exponents of UK landscape scale conservation are the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are 49 AONB in the UK. They have championed the "Protected Landscape Approach" that is a standard for all category 5 protected areas in the international hierarchy of protected areas as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).&lt;ref&gt;"Protected Areas in the United Kingdom" by Phillips, A. and Partington, R. in "The Protected Landscape Approach: Linking Nature, Culture and Community" Brown, J, Mitchell, N &amp; Beresford, M (Eds) (2005) IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. pp 119 - 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for all landscape scale conservation schemes must be an understanding of the character of the landscape. Landscape character goes far beyond an appreciation of an area's visual attractiveness. It involves a deep understanding of how the landscape functions to support internal and external communities, cultural heritage and development, local and macro economies as well as the wildlife and natural resources of the area. Landscape character requires careful assessment according to accepted methodologies. Landscape character assessment will contribute to the determination of what scale is appropriate in which landscape. "Landscape scale" does not mean merely making things bigger, or acting at a bigger scale than previously: it has to mean that conservation is carried out at the correct scale and that it takes into account the human elements of the landscape, both past and present.

==Natural sites==
A key inspiration for this approach was the [[Oostvaardersplassen]] near [[Amsterdam]], a huge wetland landscape that is managed largely through natural processes. These principles have been applied in the UK, such as on the Essex Coast at [[Abbot's Hall]] where managed retreat has been used to create new salt-marshes and coastal wetland.

==Existing woodland==
In recent years studies have been carried out across the UK looking at much wider range of habitats. In [[Wales]] the Pumlumon Large Area Conservation Project focusses on upland conservation in areas of marginal agriculture and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montwt.co.uk/pumlumon.html&lt;/ref&gt; The North Somerset Levels and Moors Project addresses wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428170209/http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |archivedate=2007-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several woodland based initiatives, often focusing on increasing linkages between existing woodland. An unusual approach is being taken in the [[Black Country]] where [[Black Country Living Landscape]] is applying these principals to an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html#focus {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730094310/http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool for adaptation==
Landscape scale conservation is seen by some as an essential tool for [[adaptation]] to climate change, particularly in ensuring diverse and viable biodiversity in a changing landscape. To others in the UK it is more visionary, an opportunity to plan for a landscape which answers the needs of both people and wildlife in a crowded island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-nature.org.uk/pubs/publication/PDF/urbio7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''liberal education''' is a system or course of education suitable for the cultivation of a [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] (Latin: ''liber'') human being. It is based on the [[Medieval university|medieval]] concept of the [[liberal arts]] or, more commonly now, the [[liberalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Liberal Arts Education|url=http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215125841/http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|archivedate=15 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as "a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ... characterised by challenging encounters with important issues, and more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study" by the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Liberal Education?|url=http://www.aacu.org/resources/liberaleducation/index.cfm|publisher=Association of American Colleges &amp; Universities|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Usually global and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] in scope, it can include a general education [[curriculum]] which provides broad exposure to multiple disciplines and learning strategies in addition to in-depth study in at least one [[Academia|academic]] area.

Liberal education was advocated in the 19th century by thinkers such as [[John Henry Newman]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]].
[[Wilfred Griffin Eady|Sir Wilfred Griffin Eady]] defined liberal education as being education for its own sake and personal enrichment, with the teaching of values.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison]] (1954); ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854–1954)'', p. 191; Routledge Kegan Paul. {{ISBN|0-415-43221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of liberal education is often attributed to mobilization during the Second World War. The premium and emphasis placed upon mathematics, science, and technical training caused the loss of its prominent position in higher education studies. However, it became central to much undergraduate education in the United States in the mid-20th century, being conspicuous in the movement for 'general education'.

==Definition==
The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] describes a liberal education in this way: "Ideally, a liberal education produces persons who are open-minded and free from provincialism, dogma, preconception, and ideology; conscious of their opinions and judgments; reflective of their actions; and aware of their place in the social and natural worlds."{{sfn|Project on Liberal Education and the Sciences|1990|p=xi}} Liberally educated people are skeptical of their own traditions; they are trained to think for themselves rather than conform to higher authorities.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=10}}

It also cultivates "active citizenship" through off-campus community service, internships, research, and study abroad.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=6–8}} Some faculty see this movement towards "civic engagement" as more pedagogically powerful than traditional classroom teaching, but opponents argue that the education occurring within an academic institution must be purely intellectual and scholarly.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=10–11}}

A liberal education combines an education in the [[classics]], [[English literature]], the [[humanities]], and moral virtues.{{sfn|Van Doren|1943|p=43}} The term ''liberal education'' in the modern sense should not be confused with ''[[liberal arts education]]''; the latter deals with academic subjects, while the former deals with ideological subjects. Indeed, a liberal arts education does not necessarily include a liberal education, and a liberal arts program may even be as specialized as a vocational program.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=56}} For practical purposes, liberal education is not actually differentiated from liberal arts education today, except by scholars.

Unlike a professional and vocational education that prepares students for their careers, a liberal education prepares students to utilize their leisure time. Such an education helps the individual navigate internal and external conflicts in life. For example, a liberal education aims to help students be self-conscious and aware of their actions and motivations. Individuals also become more considerate for other beliefs and cultures. According to James Engel, the author of ''The Value of a Liberal Arts Education'', ''"A liberal education provides the framework for an educated and thoughtful citizen."''{{sfn|The Value of a Liberal Arts Education||}}

==History==
Definitions of a liberal education may be broad, generalized, and sometimes even contradictory.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=52}} "It is at once the most enduring and changeable of academic traditions."{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} Axelrod, Anisef, and Lin suggest that conceptions of liberal education are rooted in the teaching methods of [[Ancient Greece]],{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} a slave-owning community divided between slaves and freemen. The freemen, mostly concerned about their rights and obligations as citizens, received a non-specialized, non-vocational, [[liberal arts]] education that produced well-rounded citizens aware of their place in society. At the same time, [[Socrates]] emphasized the importance of [[individualism]], impressing upon his students the duty of man to form his own opinions through reason rather than indoctrination. [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] education also provided a balance between developing the mind and the body. Another possibility is that liberal education dates back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]], where the teachings of [[Confucianism]] focused on propriety, morality, and social order. Hoerner{{who|date=January 2015}} also suggests that [[Jesus]] was a liberal educator, as "he was talking of a free man capable of thinking for himself and of being a responsible citizen," but liberal education is still commonly traced back to the Greeks.{{sfn|Valerio, Jim Ellis|1970|pp=2–3}}

While liberal education was stifled during the barbarism of the [[Early Middle Ages]], it rose to prominence once again in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, especially with the re-emergence of [[Aristotelian philosophy]]. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw a revolt against narrow spirituality and educators started to focus on the human, rather than God. This [[humanism|humanist]] approach favored reason, nature and aesthetics.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=4–6}}

Study of the [[Classics]] and [[humanities]] slowly returned in the fourteenth century, which led to increased study of both [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, liberal education focused mostly on the classics. Commoners, however, were not too keen on studying the classics, so they instead took up vernacular languages and literature, and also the sciences. Until at least the twentieth century, both humanist and classicist influences remained in the liberal education, and proponents of a [[progressive education]] also embraced the humanist philosophy. Study of the classics continued in the form of the [[Great Books]] program.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=7–8}} [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] brought this program to the [[University of Chicago]]. Upon Hutchins' resignation, the university got rid of the program, but an adapted version still exists at [[Shimer College]].

While liberal education is a Western movement, it has been influential in other regions as well. For example, in Japan during the general liberalism of the [[Taishō period]], there was a liberal education movement that saw the establishment of a number of schools based on liberal education in the 1920s – see [[:ja:大正自由教育運動|大正自由教育運動]].

==Relationship with professional education==
Liberal education and professional education have often been seen as divergent. [[German universities]] moved towards more professional teaching in the nineteenth century, and unlike American students, who still pursued a liberal education, students elsewhere started to take professional courses in the first or second year of study.{{sfn|Ofer|2007|p=47}} In the early twentieth century, [[American liberal arts colleges]] still required students to pursue a common curriculum, whereas public universities allowed a student to move on to more pragmatic courses after having taken general education courses for the first two years of study. As an emphasis on specialized knowledge grew in the middle of the century, colleges began to adjust the proportion of required general education courses to those required for a particular major.{{sfn|Fong|2004|pp=8–9}}

As [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] points out, standardized testing has placed more emphasis on honing technical knowledge, and its quantitative, multiple-choice nature prompts rote learning in the classroom. At the same time, humanistic concepts such as imagination and critical thinking, which cannot be tested by such methods, are disappearing from college curricula.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=13}}

Thirty percent of college graduates in the United States are likely to eventually work in jobs that do not exist yet.{{sfn|Fong|2004|p=9}} Proponents of a liberal education therefore argue that a postsecondary education must prepare students for an increasingly complex labor market. Rather than provide narrowly designed technical courses, a liberal education would foster critical thinking and analytical skills that allow the student to adapt to a rapidly changing workforce.{{sfn|Geary Schneider|2009}} The movement towards career-oriented courses within a liberal education has begun at places like [[Dartmouth College]], where a journalism course combines lessons on writing style with reading and analyzing historical journalism.{{sfn|Jaschik|2004}} An American survey of CEOs published in 1997 revealed that employers were more focused on the long-term outcomes of education, such as adaptability, than college students and their parents, who were more concerned with the short-term outcomes of getting a job.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=56}}

==Provision==
Ronel B. Esquivel said only eight percent of colleges provide a liberal education to four percent of students in the United States.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=59}} Liberal education revived three times in the United States during periods of industrialization and shifts of social preoccupations—before [[World War I]], after [[World War II]], and in the late 1970s—perhaps as a reaction against overspecialization in undergraduate curricula.{{sfn|Xin|2004|p=1}}

Currently, pressures from employers, parents and governments have defined the type of education offered at educational institutions. Such trends have curtailed the role of education offered in America. Universities have now provided education for the sole purpose to prepare students for the workforce. This idea has negatively influenced the credibility of liberal education which has impacted how students view higher education. The negative impact being a focus on specific disciplinary practices separating it from the original ideology of liberal education as a "...a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ..." {{sfn|"The parent factor: how parents view their school-aged children's options for college."||}} Politicians have influenced the type of education provided at universities. These politicians have been recently cutting the funds for universities applying immense pressure on higher educational institutions. Lack of funds have caused many to abandon the liberal arts curricula. Therefore, universities have been forced to provide a curriculum useful for providing a vocational education. The lack of funds to maintain a balanced education system has caused American universities to provide an education with a lack of emphasis on liberal values.{{sfn| Kiener Robert|2013|p=63-64}}

The disappearance of liberal education can also be traced to Liberal Art Colleges. Students are beginning to view higher education as a preparation for careers. This has then led to the natural selection of colleges. Obviously, the thought of having education that instructs to enhance the individual for the purpose of improving society does not meet current demands. Thus, as a result, Liberal Art Colleges are diminishing along with the emphasis on providing a liberal education. .{{sfn|Di Leo|2011|pp=1-2}}

Chinese universities began to implement liberal curricula between the 1920s and 1940s, but shifted to specialized education upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. Higher education reform in the 1990s returned to liberal education. In 2000 [[Peking University]] started to offer a liberal education curriculum to its undergraduate students, followed by other institutions throughout the country.{{sfn|Xin|2004|pp=1–2}}

Some of the universities in [[India]] have started offering Liberal Arts Education. [[Ahmedabad University]] is one such young university which offers students a&amp;nbsp;[[Liberal arts education|liberal education]]&amp;nbsp;focused on research and interdisciplinary learning.

In Rembrandt scholar Stephanie Dickey's words: {{quote|[Rembrandt] earned international renown as a painter, printmaker, teacher, and art collector while never leaving the Dutch Republic. In his home city of Leiden and in Amsterdam, where he worked for nearly forty years, he mentored generations of other painters and produced a body of work that has never ceased to attract admiration, critique, and interpretation. (...) Rembrandt's art is a key component in any study of the Dutch Golden Age, and his membership in the canon of artistic genius is well established, but he is also a figure whose significance transcends specialist interest. Literary critics have pondered "Rembrandt" as a "cultural text"; novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers have romanticized his life, and in popular culture, his name has become synonymous with excellence for products and services, ranging from toothpaste to self-help advice."&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"&gt;Franits, Wayne (ed.): ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Dutch Art of the Seventeenth Century''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22621">{{distinguish|MacGuffin (cipher)}}
In [[fiction]], a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''') is a [[plot device]] in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no [[narrative]] explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.

The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially [[Thriller film|thrillers]]. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first [[Act (theater)|act]], and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as '''plot coupons'''.&lt;ref name="ansible"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html |title=The Well-Tempered Plot Device |last=Lowe |first=Nick |authorlink=&lt;!-- not the comics writer (born 1979).

==History and use==
The use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name ''MacGuffin''.&lt;ref name=mward /&gt;  The [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian Legend]] has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=mward&gt;Dr. Marjory T. Ward, "King Arthur Revisited" in Dr. Andrew Keen (ed.) "Proceedings of the Second History/Literature Conference on Medieval Literature"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I]]–era actress [[Pearl White]] used ''weenie'' to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and the other [[Movie serial#Silent era|silent film serials]] in which she starred.&lt;ref name="Lahue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bound and Gagged: The Story of the Silent Serials |first=Kalton C. |last=Lahue |year=1968 |publisher=Oak Tree Pubs |isbn=978-0-498-06762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1929 detective novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', a small [[statuette]] provides both the book's [[eponymous]] title and its motive for intrigue.

The name ''MacGuffin'' was coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Colin|title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie: A British Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-86064-633-1|p=21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215809/https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the 1930s.

===Alfred Hitchcock===
The [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]] Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term ''MacGuffin'' and the technique with his 1935 film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', an early example of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall Deutelbaum |author2=Leland A. Poague |year=2009 |title=A Hitchcock reader |page=114 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digou|first=Mike|title=Hitchcock's Macguffin In The Works Of David Mamet|journal=Literature Film Quarterly|date=October 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' in a 1939 lecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interviewed in 1966 by [[François Truffaut]], Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' using the same story.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framing Hitchcock: Selected essays from the Hitchcock annual|publisher=Wayne State University Press Detroit|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|work=[[Google Books]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock also said, "The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=David |date=1995 |title=Perspectives on Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqZZAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=G. K. Hall |page=31 |isbn= 9780816116034 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's term ''MacGuffin'' helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface.  Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for [[Richard Schickel]]'s documentary ''The Men Who Made the Movies'', and in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cavettbiter|title=Alfred Hitchcock was confused by a laxative commercial|date=2007-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503122702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]], a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |title=Frequently asked questions on Hitchcock |author=Ken Mogg |work=labyrinth.net.au |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703212952/http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |archivedate=July 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lucas===
On the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]] describes [[R2-D2]] as "the main driving force of the movie&amp;nbsp;... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin&amp;nbsp;... the object of everybody's search".&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;''Star Wars'' (1977) Region 2 DVD release (2004). Audio commentary, 00:14:44 – 00:15:00.&lt;/ref&gt; In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object ''specifically'' is, he declared, "The audience don't care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |title=The 39 Steps – Film (Movie) Plot and Review |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193532/http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that "the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |title=Keys to the Kingdom |date=February 2008 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193209/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Lavandier===
For the filmmaker and drama writing theorist [[Yves Lavandier]], in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |title=Excerpts from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118203139/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |archivedate=January 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[North by Northwest]]''{{'}}s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''. In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |title=Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150601/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Please don't add an example without a reliable source explicitly calling it a MacGuffin. Google Books might be of help. Also, please limit examples unless an existing one can be replaced by a much better one. The point of MacGuffins is that they are a very common device. This is a list of *examples*, not an exhaustive run-down of every work that has one.--&gt;
Alfred Hitchcock popularized the use of the MacGuffin technique.&lt;ref name=FreeDictionary&gt;{{cite dictionary | url = https://www.thefreedictionary.com/MacGuffin | title = MacGuffin | work = The Free Dictionary | publisher = Farlex, Inc. | date = | access-date = 7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from Hitchcock's films include plans for a silent plane engine in ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', radioactive uranium ore in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and a clause from a secret peace treaty in ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''.&lt;ref name="Walker2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Michael|title=Hitchcock's Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWhZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297|accessdate=2 September 2017|year=2005|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-773-9|page=297|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215808/https://books.google.com/books?id=OWhZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297|archivedate=24 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other films have also deployed this technique; for example, the Maltese Falcon in the [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|1941 film of the same name]], the meaning of "Rosebud" in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi.html |website=Filmsite.org |title=Greatest Films: Citizen Kane (1941) |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003503/http://www.filmsite.org/citi.html |archivedate=March 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Heart of the Ocean]] necklace in 1997's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=April 4, 2012 |title=TIME's Titanic 3D Review |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/04/titanic-time-and-me/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191147/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/04/titanic-time-and-me/ |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the letters of transit in ''[[Casablanca]]'' (1942 film),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.purpleclover.com/entertainment/6617-classic-movie-mcguffins/item/letterscasablanca-mcguffins/|website=purpleclover.com |title=The Letters of Transit in 'Casablanca' | accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Rabbit's Foot" in ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observer.com/node/38831 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106064328/http://www.observer.com/node/38831 |archivedate=November 6, 2007 |title=What the MacGuffin?

In discussing the mixed critical reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the primary criticism was that the [[crystal skull]] in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin. The director [[Steven Spielberg]] said, "I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Steven Spielberg admits he had reservations about 'Indiana Jones 4,' but still defends worst scene in 'Indiana Jones 4' |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193750/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macroinvertebrate Community Index''' (MCI) is an [[Index (statistics)|index]] used in [[New Zealand]] to measure the [[water quality]] of fresh water streams.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Index|url=https://www.lawa.org.nz/learn/glossary/m/macroinvertebrate-community-index-(mci)|website=www.lawa.org.nz|publisher=Land Air Water Aoteraroa|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or lack of [[invertebrate|macroinvertebrates]] such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a [[Bioindicator|biological indicator]] on the health of that waterway.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Composition (MCI)|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/fresh-water/river-condition-indicator/macroinvertebrates|website=Ministry for the Environment|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCI assigns a number to each [[species]] of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to [[pollution]]. The index then calculates an average score.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"/&gt; A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"/&gt;

The '''MCI (Macro invertebrate Community Index)''' relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478.&lt;/ref&gt; MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation:&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"/&gt;

'''MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20'''

Previous [[water quality]] assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="BENNETT"&gt;Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt; Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution,&lt;ref name="BENNETT"/&gt; and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as [[sedimentation]], [[urbanization]], [[agricultural]] practices and forest harvesting effects.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"&gt;Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111&lt;/ref&gt; Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as [[oligochaetes]] and [[chironomids]].&lt;ref name="HALL"&gt;Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a lack of species diversity and low [[biotic index]] scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.&lt;ref name="COLLINS"&gt;Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low-elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.&lt;ref name="LARNED"&gt;Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro invertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"/&gt; The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.&lt;ref name="OLOMUKORO"&gt;Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variations on the MCI'''

In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‐abundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"&gt;Wright‐Stow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‐monitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the [[exertion]], in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Searsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Consistency on the different versions of MCI have not yet been formally measured despite the communication that has been made to the public, managers and politicians.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt;
	

'''QMCI values can be calculated using:
QMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example:

'''SQMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

'''Factors Influencing MCI'''
There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark &amp; Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in [[taxa]] and tolerance values.&lt;ref name="LARNED"/&gt;
	

[[Spatial variability]] is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"&gt;Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882&lt;/ref&gt;
	

Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and [[substratum]] on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution.
	

There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt;
	

There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt; Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

'''Music engraving''' is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The term ''music copying'' is almost equivalent—though ''music engraving'' implies a higher degree of skill and quality, usually for publication. The name of the process originates in plate engraving, a widely used technique dating from the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''engraving'' is now used to refer to any high-quality method of drawing [[music notation]], particularly on a [[computer]] ("computer engraving" or "computer setting") or by hand ("hand engraving").

== Traditional engraving techniques ==

=== Elements of music engraving style ===
Mechanical music engraving began in the middle of the fifteenth century. As [[musical composition]] increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate [[Sheet music|musical score]]s. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

=== Moveable type ===
Similar to book printing, music printing began in the fifteenth century with the use of [[moveable type]]. The central problem posed to early music engravers using moveable type was the proper integration of notes, staves, and text. Often, staff lines were hand drawn prior to printing, or added to the printed music afterward. [[Ottavio Petrucci]], one of the most innovative music printers working at the turn of the sixteenth century, used a triple impression technique that printed staves, text, and notes in three separate steps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plate engraving ===
Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, plates were engraved freely by hand. Eventually, music engravers developed a number of tools to aid in their process, including:
* Scorers for staves and [[Bar (music)|bar lines]], the use of which inspired the term [[Sheet music|musical score]]
* Elliptical gravers for [[Dynamics (music)|crescendos and diminuendos]]
* Flat gravers for [[Tie (music)|ties]] and [[ledger lines]]
* [[Punch (tool)|Punches]] for [[note head]]s, [[clefs]], [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], and letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music Publishing in the Canadas, 1800-1867|last = Calderisi|first = Maria|publisher = National Library of Canada|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Ottawa|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day, and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html|title = Music Engraving|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = G. Henle Publishers|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand copying ===
Historically, a musician was required to draw his own [[staff (music)|staff]] lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the twentieth century, music staff paper was sometimes printed on [[vellum]] or [[onionskin]]—a durable, semi-transparent material that made it easier for the musician to correct mistakes and revise the work, and also made it possible to reproduce the manuscript through the [[ozalid|ozalid process]]. Also at this time, a [[music copyist]] was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each performer) from a composer's full score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

=== Other techniques ===
* '''[[Lithography]]''': Similar to metal plate engraving, the music was etched onto limestone and then burned onto the surface with acid to preserve the stone plates for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/lithography/about-lithography.html|title = About Lithography|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stencils''', '''stamps''', and '''dry transfers''', including the Notaset, a system inspired by the [[Letraset]] used in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/stencils/transfers.html|title = Transfers|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing ink through stencils was a high-quality technique used by [[Amersham]]-based company Halstan &amp; Co.
* '''Music [[typewriters]]''': Originally developed in the late nineteenth century, this technology did not become popular until the mid-1900s. The machines required the use of pre-printed [[manuscript paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/music-typewriters|title = Music Typewriters|date = |accessdate = October 22, 2017|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique produced low-quality results and was never widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Machine Types Simplified Music."] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer music engraving ==
{{Main article|Scorewriter}}

With the advent of the [[personal computer]] since the 1980s, traditional music engraving has been in decline, as it can now be accomplished by computer [[software]] designed for this purpose. There are various such programs, known as [[scorewriter]]s, designed for writing, editing, printing and playing back music, though only a few produce results of a quality comparable to high-quality traditional engraving. Scorewriters have many advanced features, such as the ability to extract individual parts from an orchestral/band score, to transcribe music played on a [[MIDI]] keyboard, and conversely to play back notation via MIDI.

Beginning in the 1980s, [[WYSIWYG]] software such as [[Sibelius Software|Sibelius]], [[MuseScore]], and [[Finale (software)|Finale]] first let musicians enter complex music notation on a computer screen, displaying it just as it will look when eventually printed. Such software stores the music in files of proprietary or standardized formats, usually not directly readable by humans.

Other software, such as GNU [[LilyPond]] and [[Philip's Music Writer]], reads input from ordinary text files whose contents resemble a computer [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] programming language that describes bare musical content with little or no layout specification. The software translates the usually handwritten description into fully engraved graphical pages to view or send for printing, taking care of appearance decisions from high level layout down to glyph drawing. The music entry process is iterative and is similar to the edit-compile-execute cycle used to debug computer programs.

Beside ready-made [[Application software|applications]] there are also some [[Library (computing)|programming libraries]] for music engraving, such as [http://www.vexflow.com/ Vexflow] ([[JavaScript|Javascript]] library), [http://www.verovio.org/ Verovio] (C++, [[JavaScript|Javascript]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), [http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/ Guido Engine] ([[C++]] library), and [http://manufaktura-controls.com/ Manufaktura Controls] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]] libraries).  The main purpose of these libraries is to reduce time required for development of software with score rendering capabilities.

'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.

Patriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=0-02-865960-0}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111–114 |quote="Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|last1=Pateman|title=Sexual Contract|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term ''patriarchy'' was used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family. However, since the late 20th century it has more often been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,&lt;ref name="Cannell &amp; Green"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4|page=592 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&amp;q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meagher"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]], assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men.

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M.

Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner, |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

===Modern history===
Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''Patriarcha''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Schochet|title=Patriarchy and Paternalism|encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=068431200X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education|publisher=Digital Library Platform &amp; Services (DLPS), University of Michigan |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was [[Sarah Grimké]], who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130–138|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Castro, Ginette|title=American Feminism: a contemporary history|publisher=NYU Press|date=1990|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, ''A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century'', Michael Grossberg coined the phrase ''judicial patriarchy'' stating that, "The judge became the buffer between the family and the state." and that, "Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gossberg | first = Michael | chapter = A judicial patriarchy: family law at the turn of the century | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=bCHkkM1dRYgC&amp;pg=PA289 | editor-last = Grossberg | editor-first = Michael | title = Governing the hearth: law and the family in nineteenth-century America | pages = 289&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | location = Chapel Hill London | date = 1985 | isbn = 9780807863367 }}

In China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable," a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskola, Teemu. “Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China.” ''The Yale Law Journal'', vol. 103, no. 8, 1994, pp. 2531–2565. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/797055.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the [[People's Republic of China]], laws governing morality which were written as egalitarian were selectively enforced favoring men, permissively allowing [[female infanticide]], while infanticide of any form was, by the letter of the law, prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jimmerson|first=Julie|date=Winter 1991|title=Female Infanticide in China: An Examination of Cultural and Legal Norms|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/80n7k798|journal=Pacific Basin Law Journal|volume=8|pages=33|via=eScholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.

==Feminist theory==
Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last=Rosemarie|first=Tong|publisher=|others=Botts, Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a "good mother," she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. J.

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org|title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda|last=Montiel|first=Aimée Vega|date=8 October 2014|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''male [[chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks | first = bell|chapter=Understanding patriarchy|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love|publisher=Washington Square Press|date=2004|pages=17–25|isbn=9780743480338|quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing  patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=John |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollart |first1=Anne |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of [[gender feminism]], such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book |author=Sommers, Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism?

This is called [[biological determinism]], which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.

A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution{{clarify|date=May 2016}} before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book | last = Coney | first = Sandra | title = The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women | publisher = Hunter House | location = Alameda, California | date = 1994 | isbn = 9780897931618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

A growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gould | first= Stephen |title= The panda's thumb: more reflections in natural history |pages= 152–159 |publisher= Norton |location = New York |date= 1992 |origyear= 1980 |isbn= 978-0393340839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.&lt;ref name="Hedges and Nowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Larry V. | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Amy | title = Sex differences in mental test scores, variability, and numbers of high-scoring individuals | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 269 | issue = 5220 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1126/science.7604277 | pmid = 7604277 | jstor = 2889145 | date = 7 July 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"/&gt; Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which "men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|132}}

Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a "relationship between intelligence and brain size".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} However, there is "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# The household: women are more likely to do the housework and raise the children
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walby | first = Sylvia | title = Theorizing patriarchy |page=20 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 1990 | isbn = 9780631147688 }}

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780688051754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | author-link = Eleanor Leacock | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;365 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 | jstor = 674209 | date = June 1974 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = David Michael | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = David P. | title = Evolutionary psychology and feminism | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;787 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, an alternative evolutionary theory has challenged this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Miller | first = Geoffrey F. | title = Mutual mate choice models as the red pill in evolutionary psychology: long delayed, much needed, ideologically challenging, and hard to swallow | journal = [[Psychological Inquiry]] | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 207&amp;ndash;210 | doi = 10.1080/1047840X.2013.817937 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment Fertility Theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Lynn Carol |last2=Fishkin|first2=Stephanie Allison|chapter=On the dynamics of human bonding and reproductive success: Seeking windows on the adapted-for human–environmental interface |chapterurl= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZkPrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197 | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = Jeffry A. | editor-last2 = Kenrick | editor-first2 = Douglas T.|title=Evolutionary social psychology |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York Hove, England|page=197 |origyear=1997 |date = 2014 |isbn= 9781317779476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Miller |first1= Lynn Carol |last2= Christensen |first2= John L. |last3= Pedersen |first3= William C. |last4= Putcha-Bhagavatula |first4= Anila |last5= Appleby |first5= Paul Robert |title= Attachment fertility theory: Complex systems of mechanisms simplify sex, mating, and sexual risks |journal= [[Psychological Inquiry]] | volume=24 |issue=3 |pages= 211–220 |doi= 10.1080/1047840x.2013.817322 |pmid= 25541575 |date= 2013 | ref= harv |pmc= 4275046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[attachment theory]], observes that human infants are born with a level of helplessness unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom and that father involvement is critical to human [[Infant mortality|infant survival]]. Because the investment in offspring required by human males and females is nearly equal, they are proposed to have evolved sex-similar mating preferences (Mutual Mate Choice),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart-Williams | first1 = S. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = A.

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states, "The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Matriarchy|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]]'' (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, "[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | chapter = Troubling patriarchy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Studying men and masculinities | pages = 106–107 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415578295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Mosuo]] (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other societies are [[matrilinear]] or [[matrilocal]], primarily among indigenous tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|title=Male dominance and female autonomy: domestic authority in matrilineal societies|date=1972|publisher=HRAF Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn =9780875363288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[hunter-gatherer]] groups have been characterized as largely [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="erdal"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Erdal | first1 = David | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | chapter = Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ | editor-last1 = Mellars | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Gibson | editor-first2 = Kathleen Rita | title = Modelling the early human mind | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge | location = Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut | series = Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series | date = 1996 | isbn = 9780951942017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a [[cultural universal]].&lt;ref name="Ciccodicola2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ciccodicola | first = Floriana | title = Practicing anthropology in development processes: new perspectives for a radical anthropology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq9QSx4CQLAC&amp;pg=PA160 | page = 160 | publisher = Edizioni Nuova Cultura | location = Roma | date = 2012 | isbn = 9788861347915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females
# the evolution of language and its power to create ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara. "The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy."  Human Nature, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | author-link = Juliet Mitchell | chapter = The cultural revolution | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism | page = 409 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780394474724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eherenreich | first = Barbara | chapter = Life without father | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC | editor-last1 = McDowell | editor-first1 = Linda | editor-last2 = Pringle | editor-first2 = Rosemary | title = Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions | publisher = Polity/Open University | location = London | date = 1992 | isbn = 9780745609799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto | location = London Concord, Massachusetts | date = 1991 | isbn = 9780745305837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith | author-link = Shulamith Firestone | title = The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zxy2AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Quill | location = New York | date = 1970 | isbn = 9780688123598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:WiltonChurch.jpg|thumb|300px|Church of SS Mary and Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, by TH Wyatt, 1841–4]]
In the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and part of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicist or Historismus]] styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as [[Rundbogenstil]] or round arched style.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=54–56}} In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.

== The origins of the Romanesque Revival or Norman Revival in the United Kingdom ==

[[File:North Scarle, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|150px|North Scarle, Lincolnshire]] 
The development of the ''Norman'' revival style or ''Neo-Norman'' took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with [[Inigo Jones]]‘s [[Window|re-fenestration]] of the White Tower of the [[Tower of London]] in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by [[Hugh May]] for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building,&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=587}}

In the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being [[Saxon]] rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include [[Shirburn Castle]] in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and [[Enmore Castle]] in Somerset. At [[Allerton Mauleverer]] in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a ''proto-Neo-Norman''. While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam]] nave roof. The architect is thought to have been [[John Vardy]] surveyor to the Office of Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leach|Pevsner|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|thumb|225px|Tickencote Church 1792 Early example of church Romanesque revival]]
A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for the conservation and rebuilding of [[St Peter's Church, Tickencote]] in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate [[chancel]] arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The [[nave]] was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian)
 |year=1935 |chapter=Tickencote |title=A History of the County of Rutland |volume=II |series=[[Victoria County History]] |place=London |publisher=St Catherine Press |pages=275–281 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/rutland/vol2/pp275-281 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840’s under architectects such as [[Thomas Penson]] and [[Benjamin Ferrey]]. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. [[File:Front entrance to Eastnor Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1468597.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, combining Romanesque and Gothic features]] In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at [[Inverary]], started in 1744, and castles by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Culzean]] (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and [[Seton Palace]] (1792). In England [[James Wyatt]] used round arched windows at [[Sandleford Priory]], Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild [[Arundel Castle]], while [[Eastnor Castle]] in Herefordshire was built by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1981 |title=The Norman Revival in British Architecture 1790–1870}} PhD Thesis, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Development of ''Archaeologically Correct'' Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of the ''archaeological correctness'' was popularised by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] in his many writings and he was using the term by 1950 in his Broadcast Talks (page 190) to describe architecture and designs based closely on illustrations of actual buildings or objects.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8eaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Pevsner+archaeologically+correct&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkM10Y0f1I&amp;sig=gKtc0zp0nG3E71Al_PHmcJZFk5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKPAvJfKAhXIYQ4KHR3hCJwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pevsner%20archaeologically%20correct&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[File:GosfordCastle.jpg|thumb|left|GosfordCastle, Armagh by Thomas Hopper]] 
[[File:Penrhyn Castle - geograph.org.uk - 206536.jpg|thumb|Penrhyn Castle - by Thomas Hopper 1820–37]]
It was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in ''Archaeologia'' (1832–33), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickman |first=Thomas |title=` |journal=Archaeologia |volume=XXV |publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]] |pages=159–185}} esp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1991 |chapter=Penrhryn and the Norman Revival |series=National Trust Guide |title=Penrhryn Castle, Gwynedd |place= |publisher=National Trust |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Architecture and the Romanesque Revival==

[[File:Rhosllanerchrugog Church.jpeg|thumb|Rhosllanerchrugog Church, 1852]]
[[File:Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar.JPG|thumb|Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar]]
However, the ''Norman Revival'' did catch on for church architecture. It was [[Thomas Penson]], a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German [[Brick Gothic]]. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]], Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are [[Christ Church, Welshpool]], 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|p=13}} Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], Wrexham of 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=E |series=The Buildings of Wales |title=Clwyd |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |page=264 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Losh and Wreay Church===
A most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was [[St Mary's Church, Wreay|St Mary’s Church at Wreay]], near Carlisle.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/losh/1.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=St Mary's Church, Wreay, by Sarah Losh (1785–1853) |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed by [[Sarah Losh]] and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read [[Thomas Hope (architect)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''Historical Study of Architecture'' (1815), which uses the term ''Lombardic'' for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an ''unpolished mode of building'' that ''most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |year=2012 |title=The Pinecone: the Story of Sara Losh |place=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0571269501 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, while the arcading of the [[apse]] certainly has a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] feel to it.&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt;

==Other Early Victorian Architects working in the Romanesque revival style==
The early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas [[high church]]es and [[Anglo-Catholic]], which were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]]; low churches and [[Broad church]]es of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|pages=170–73|title=The Gothic Revival|edition=3rd|year=1962
|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn= 0719502330}}, and also Cambridge Camden Society (1841),''A Few Words to Church-builders''[https://archive.org/details/fewwordstochurch00camb].&lt;/ref&gt; The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.

===Edmund Sharpe===
Another architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was [[Edmund Sharpe]], who set up his practice at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of [[William Whewell]] and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]]. He was awarded a travelling scholarship to study the early architecture of Germany and Southern France and supplied [[Thomas Rickman]] with information.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M. (1897), rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 18 February 2012 ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharpe despite being an architectural historian of some note, built churches that were much freer interpretations of the Romanesque and [[Brick Gothic|German Brick Gothic]] and might be considered less ''archaeologically correct''.

[[File:St Paul's Parish Church, Scotforth, Doorway - geograph.org.uk - 904970.jpg|thumb|St Paul's, Scotforth, Doorway, 1874–6]]
Four of Sharpe's earliest churches&amp;nbsp;– [[St Saviour's Church, Cuerden|St&amp;nbsp;Saviour, Bamber Bridge]] (1836–37);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=116}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Mark's Church, Blackburn|St&amp;nbsp;Mark, Witton]] (1836–38); and [[St Paul's Church, Farington|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Farington]], near [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] (1839–40)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=125}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because ''no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque''. They ''turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged''. The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements [[St Mary's Church, Conistone]] in [[Wharfedale]] (1846); and [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Scotforth]] in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth]], was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a ''strange building'' and ''an anachronism, almost beyond belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1969 |title=Lancashire |volume=2 The Rural North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=29, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M., rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood, (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] , Retrieved on 18 August 2009 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, when he was aged 68, he returned to architecture and designed this church which was opened in 1876.{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=401}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=47}} The church had used terracotta in a similar fashion to his earliest churches and it can only be assumed that its anachronistic appearance was that he had used a design that he had prepared at least 20 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;See Stratton, 1993, pages 50–52 for a discussion of the early use of [[architectural terracotta]] in the ''pot'' churches of Sharpe and Penson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Ferrey===
[[File:East Grafton - St Nicholas Church - geograph.org.uk - 1448466.jpg|thumb|left|East Grafton - St Nicholas Church, 1842–44]]
[[File:Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great - geograph.org.uk - 223562.jpg|thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844–46]] The work of [[Benjamin Ferrey]] can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at [[East Grafton]] in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Wiltshire Community History|title=Church of St. Nicholas, East Grafton|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getchurch.php?id=1184|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque [[Lych gate]].

A more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of [[Monreale]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweddle |first=Marilyn |title=A Historical Guide to the Church of St James the Great |place=Morpeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the [[portico]] at the cathedral at [[Monreale]], but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in [[Melplash]] in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.

===William Perkin of Leeds===
St Michael and All Angels [[Barton le Street]], North Yorkshire.
This church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by [[Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram|Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1966 |title=Yorkshire: the North Riding |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071029-9 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE| num=1148993 |desc=Church of St Michael |grade=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for [[Dissenting]] chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to [[Anglican]] churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the [[Baptists]]. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of [[Italianate]] Romanesque as seen at the [[Potters Bar|Potter's Bar]] Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbbc.org.uk/home Potters Bar Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist Church in Brown Street [[Salisbury]] of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more ''archaeologically correct'' in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects [[Michael Drury|Drury and Mortimer]], the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the [[castellated]] Gothic style.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=521–2}}

===Synagogues===
The Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. 
One of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at [[Grimsby]] in Lincolnshire.

[[File:West Kirk (geograph 1866764).jpg|thumb|West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr, by William Gale 1844–45]] 
The earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.
In Scotland the [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]]s occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. 
[[St Conan’s Kirk]] Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1082 |title=St Conan's Kirk |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another church is Cranshaws in [[Berwickshire]]. Here the 1739 church was rebuilt in 1899 by architect George Fortune in Romanesque Revival style.

==Sir Alfred Waterhouse and developed Romanesque Architecture==

[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London]]
Interest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Natural History Museum]] in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=70–77}} It was built in shades of buff coloured [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the [[Wrexham]] and [[Ruabon]] area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.

Waterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by [[William Watkins (architect)|William Watkins]], a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red [[Ruabon]] terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=509}} An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln.

[[File:St Aidans 2754.jpg|thumb|left|St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[St Aidan's Church, Leeds]] is a massive [[basilica]] church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the [[Corbel table]] or moulded [[stringcourse]] below the eaves was based on that of [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s in the Byzantine style.{{sfn|Leach|Pevsner|2009|pp=525–7}}

===20th Century===

In the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine revival style]], which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. 
Churches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.

An even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate

'''Sense of community''' (or '''psychological sense of community''') is a concept in [[community psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], and [[Community practice|community social work]], as well as in several other research disciplines, such as [[urban sociology]], which focuses on the ''experience'' of community rather than its structure, formation, setting, or other features. The latter is the province of [[public administration]] or community services administration which needs to understand how structures influence this feeling and psychological sense of community. [[Sociologist]]s, [[social psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have theorized about and carried out [[empirical research]] on community, but the [[psychological]] approach asks questions about the individual's [[perception]], [[understanding]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion|feelings]], etc. about community and his or her relationship to it and to others' participation—indeed to the complete, multifaceted community experience.

In his seminal 1974 book, psychologist [[Seymour B. Sarason]] proposed that psychological sense of community become the conceptual center for the psychology of [[community]], asserting that it "is one of the major bases for self-definition." By 1986 it was regarded as a central overarching concept for [[community psychology]] (Sarason, 1986; Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999).In addition, the theoretical concept entered the other applied academic disciplines as part of "communities for all" initiatives in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Magrab, P. (1999). The meaning of community. (pp. 3-30). In: R.N. Roberts &amp; P. R. Magrab, ''Where Children Live: Solutions for Serving Young Children and their Families''. Stamford, Ct: Ablex Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among theories of sense of community proposed by [[psychologist]]s, McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) is by far the most influential, and is the starting point for most of the recent research in the field. It is discussed in detail below.

== Definitions ==

For Sarason, psychological sense of community is "the [[perception]] of similarity to others, an acknowledged [[interdependence]] with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure" (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;157).

McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their [[personal commitment|commitment]] to be together."

Gusfield (1975) identified two dimensions of community: territorial and relational. The relational dimension of community has to do with the nature and quality of relationships in that community, and some communities may even have no discernible territorial demarcation, as in the case of a community of scholars working in a particular specialty, who have some kind of contact and quality of relationship, but may live and work in disparate locations, perhaps even throughout the world. Other communities may seem to be defined primarily according to territory, as in the case of [[neighborhood]]s, but even in such cases, proximity or shared territory cannot by itself constitute a community; the relational dimension is also essential.

[[Factor analysis]] of their urban neighborhoods [[questionnaire]] yielded two distinct factors which Riger and Lavrakas (1981) characterized as "social bonding" and "physical rootedness", very similar to the two dimensions proposed by Gusfield.
Early work on psychological sense of community was based on neighborhoods as the referent, and found a relationship between psychological sense of community and '''greater participation''' (Hunter, 1975; Wandersman &amp; Giamartino, 1980), '''perceived safety''' (Doolittle &amp; McDonald, 1978), '''ability to function competently in the community''' (Glynn, 1981), '''social bonding''' (Riger &amp; Lavrakas, 1981), '''social fabric''' (strengths of [[interpersonal relationship]]) (Ahlbrandt &amp; Cunningham, 1979), '''greater sense of purpose and perceived control''' (Bachrach &amp; Zautra, 1985), and '''greater civic contributions''' ([[Donation|charitable contributions]] and civic involvement) (Davidson &amp; Cotter, 1986). These initial studies lacked a clearly articulated [[conceptual framework]], however, and none of the measures developed were based on a [[theoretical definition]] of psychological sense of community.

== Primary theoretical foundation: McMillan and Chavis ==

McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) theory (and instrument) are the most broadly validated and widely utilized in this area in the psychological literature. They prefer the abbreviated label "sense of community", and propose that sense of community is composed of four elements.

===Four elements of sense of community===
There are four elements of "sense of community" according to the McMillan &amp; Chavis theory:

====Membership====
Membership includes five attributes:
* boundaries
* emotional safety
* a sense of belonging and identification
* personal investment
* a common symbol system

====Influence====
Influence works both ways: members need to feel that they have some influence in the group, and some influence by the group on its members is needed for group cohesion. Current researches (e.g. Chigbu, 2013) on rural and urban communities have found that sense of community is a major factor.

====Integration and fulfillment of needs====
Members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community.

====Shared emotional connection====
The "definitive element for true community" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;14), it includes shared history and shared participation (or at least identification with the history).

===Dynamics within and between the elements===
McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) give the following example to illustrate the dynamics within and between these four elements (p.&amp;nbsp;16):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Current research====
In their 2002 study of a [[community of interest]], specifically the science fiction fandom community, Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith suggest Conscious Identification as the fifth dimension (Obst, 2002).

== Empirical assessment ==

Chavis et al.'s '''Sense of Community Index''' ('''SCI''') (see Chipuer &amp; Pretty, 1999; Long &amp; Perkins, 2003), originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[school]]s, [[religious communities]], communities of interest, etc.

The '''distinction between sex and gender''' differentiates a person's [[biological sex]] (the anatomy of an individual's [[reproductive system]], and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s) from that person's [[gender]], which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person ([[gender role]]) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness ([[gender identity]]).&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;Prince, Virginia. 2005.

In some circumstances, an individual's [[assigned sex]] and gender do not align, and the person may be [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; In other cases, an individual may have biological [[sex characteristics]] that complicate sex assignment, and the person may be [[intersex]].

== Sex ==
[[Anisogamy]], or the size differences of [[gamete]]s (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes ([[sperm]]); females have large and generally immobile gametes ([[Egg cell|ova]] or eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M. &amp; Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution and behavior. Monterey: Brooks Cole&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, typical male or female [[sexual differentiation]] includes the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s ([[ovary]] or [[testes]]), the balance of [[sex hormone]]s ([[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]), the [[Human reproductive system|internal reproductive anatomy]] (e.g. [[uterus]] or [[prostate gland]]), and the external genitalia (e.g. [[penis]] or [[vulva]]).&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

=== History ===
Historian [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the [[one-sex and two-sex theories|one-sex theory]], that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure).&lt;ref&gt;Lacqueur, Thomas Walter, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Univ. Press, 1st Harvard Univ. Press pbk. ed. [5th printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-674-54355-6}}), © 1990), p.&amp;nbsp;134 (author prof. history Univ. Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[discourse]]s, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[149] (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;68 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last = Lindsey|first = Linda.

== Gender ==
In the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', ''gender'' is defined as, "[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.", with the earliest example cited being from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50093521?query_type=word&amp;queryword=gender&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-mHKT13-2771&amp;hilite=50093521 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2d ed. (online) 1989)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''gender'', noun, sense 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that ''gender'' may be defined by identity as "neither entirely female nor entirely male"; its ''Usage Note'' adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people maintain that the word ''sex'' should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word ''gender'' should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in ''gender research'', which is clear in a way that ''sex research'' is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between ''gender bias'' and ''sex bias'', and it may seem contrived to insist that ''sex'' is incorrect in this instance.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that "'[g]ender' refers to the [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women" and that "'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) used to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex'' when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|author=|date=|website=hhs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170913082514/https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = December 19, 2011|accessdate = August 3, 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809152800/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm283453.htm|archivedate = August 9, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender'' is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name="haig"/&gt;

[[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is "the classification of people as male or female" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is "one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)".&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Some [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]] maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'', a widely influential feminist text.&lt;ref&gt;Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWYbQkVyGMcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Shulamith+Firestone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Shulamith%20Firestone&amp;f=false Shulamith Firestone 1945–], ''The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers'' (2nd Edition), Routledge, 1998, pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|0-415-09623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[David Reimer]], who was, according to studies published by [[John Money]], raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl''. Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon. 2009.

=== History ===
Gender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose "at least by some 30,000 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., Olga Soffer, &amp; Jake Page, ''The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory'' (Smithsonian Books &amp; Collins (HarperCollinsPublishers), 1st Smithsonian Books ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-06-117091-1}})), p. [277].&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence was found as of  "26,000 years ago",&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. 170 &amp; see pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the archeological site [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Dolní Věstonice I]] and others, in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. [169].&lt;/ref&gt; This is during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, power and privilege in modern Europe|author1=Richard, penny  |author2=Jessica Munna |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Pearson/ Longman|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic meaning of ''gender'', ultimately derived from Latin ''genus'', was of "kind" or "variety". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of ''gender'' [[Grammatical gender|was in grammar]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', was embraced by [[feminist theory]]. This meaning of ''gender'' is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name=haig /&gt; Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mikkola|first=Mari|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction in linguistics ==
{{See also|Language and gender}}
Since the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined ''sex'' and socially constructed ''gender'', the term ''gender'' is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between ''sex'' and ''gender'', where ''sex'' refers primarily to the attributes of  real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance,  male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and [[grammatical gender]] refers to a category, such as  masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=484–486|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fowler|first1= Henry Watson | editor1-link=Jeremy Butterfield|editor1-last=Butterfield|editor1-first=Jeremy|edition=4th|date=2015|title=[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]'', for instance, states {{Quote|text=By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to the sex of the referent.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=314–316|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney

Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are ''generally''  referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus ''Mann'' (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give ''der Mann'', while ''Frau'' (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give ''die Frau''. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. ''der Tisch'', the table) or feminine (''die Armbanduhr'', the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun ''[die] Person'' refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun ''[das] Mädchen'' means "the girl".

In modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense,&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"/&gt; though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns "he" and "she", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', for instance, refers to the semantically based "covert" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the "overt" gender of some English pronouns; this yields ''nine'' gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. ''who'' and ''he'' for ''brother'' but ''which'' and ''it'' or ''she'' for ''cow''.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"/&gt;

Used primarily in sociology and gender studies, "''[[doing gender]]"'' is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex.&lt;ref name=west1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225165833/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf |date=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]''.&lt;ref name=jurik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurik | first1 = Nancy C. | last2 = Siemsen | first2 =  Cynthia | title = Doing gender as canon or agenda: A symposium on West and Zimmerman | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326677 | jstor = 20676750 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326677 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987,&lt;ref name=wz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Accounting for doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326529 | jstor = 20676758 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326529 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doing Gender'' is the most cited article published in ''Gender and Society''.&lt;ref name=jurik/&gt;

West and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}}

West and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of ''doing gender'', combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They also believe that while "doing gender" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; The concept of "doing gender" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;

== Criticism of the "sex difference" versus "gender difference" distinction ==

The current distinction between the terms ''sex difference'' versus ''gender difference'' has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior ''of an individual'' can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by [[behavioral genetics]].) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp;  Kaufer, D. (2011).  [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31233/title/Beyond-Nature-vs--Nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104094323/http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view%2FarticleNo%2F31233%2Ftitle%2FBeyond-Nature-vs--Nurture%2F |date=2014-01-04 }}.  The Scientist.  October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane F. Halpern|Diane Halpern]], in her book ''[[Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities]],'' argued problems with ''sex'' vs. ''gender'' terminology:  "I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables.  The  ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables.... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken."  She quotes [[Steven Pinker]]'s summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: "Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism..."&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2012). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities (4th Ed.). NY: Psychology Press. p. 35 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lippa writes in ''Gender, Nature and Nurture'' that "Some researchers have argued that the word ''sex'' should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word ''gender'' should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word ''gender'' tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex."&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R. (2005). Gender, Nature and Nurture. NJ: LEA, p 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved [[adaptation]], then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term ''sex difference'' could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|title=Standards of evidence for designed sex differences|author=|date=|website=ucsb.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourke CH |author2=Harrell CS |author3=Neigh GN |title=Stress-induced sex differences: adaptations mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22426413 |pmc=3384757 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''gender difference'' could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a "sex difference;" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a "gender difference."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M.E.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminism}}
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

===General===
Many feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s ''Sexing the Body'' addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because "complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.

Rather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex."&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993-2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519013103/http://www.isna.org/ |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a "natural" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.

=== Limitations ===

Some feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. [[Judith Lorber]], for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do.&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith (1993). [http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124221303/http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }}. Retrieved on 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Suzanne (1990). "The Medical Construction of Gender: Case Management of Intersexed Infants". ''Signs'', Vol. 16, No. 1: 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, "My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'"&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt;

Moreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them.&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt; Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than [[natural kind]]s.

A comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding [[Monique Wittig]], that she is "critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'"&lt;ref&gt;Zerilli, Linda M. G., ''The Trojan Horse of Universalism: Language As a 'War Machine' in the Writings of Monique Wittig'', in Robbins, Bruce, ed., ''The Phantom Public Sphere'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-8166-2124-1}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154 (n.&amp;nbsp;35 (citing Wittig, Monique, ''The Straight Mind'', in ''Feminist Issues'', vol. 1, no. 1, Summer, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;107) omitted) (author asst. prof., poli. sci. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; ed. teaches, Eng. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; coeditor, ''Social Text'') (em-dash surrounded by half-spaces in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that "the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests." Butler concludes, "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=9–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}

Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
The '''Society for Disability Studies''' is an international academic network of [[disability studies]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/about |title=About SDS - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often abbreviates its name to '''SDS''', though that abbreviation continues to be used by academics and [[political scientists]] to describe the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] organization in the [[United States]]. The society's overall goal is to promote disability studies as a serious [[academic discipline]] on par with [[philosophy]], the [[social sciences]], and similar fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html |first=Cecilia Capuzzi |last=Simon |title=Disability Studies: A New Normal |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2013-11-03 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of disability studies==
In 1993 the society adopted an official definition of "Disability Studies":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... examines the policies and practices of all societies to understand the social, rather than the physical or psychological determinants of the experience of disability. Disability Studies has been developed to disentangle impairments from the myths, ideology and stigma that influence social interaction and social policy. The scholarship challenges the idea that the economic and social statuses and the assigned roles of people with disabilities are the inevitable outcomes of their condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crds.org/about/index.shtml|title=Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies - University of Calgary|publisher=crds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Founding and history ==
The organization was founded in 1982 first as the '''Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability''' (SSCIID), and renamed '''Society for Disability Studies''' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders are Daryl Evans, Nora Groce, Steve Hey, Gary Kiger, John Seidel, Jessica Scheer and Irving Kenneth Zola (1935-1994).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Disability Studies is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

The Society maintains affiliation status with the Western Social Science Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wssaweb.com&lt;/ref&gt; (WSSA) through its Chronic Disease and Disability section. Currently, the SDS has hundreds of members both nationally and internationally who continue to make disability studies a part of academic conversations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Activities and publications==
The Society for Disability Studies holds an annual conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/annual-conference |title=Annual Conference - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org |date=2008-06-21|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June and publishes a quarterly peer-reviewed journal, the ''Disability Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dsq-sds.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/ |title=Disability Studies Quarterly|publisher=dsq-sds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is published exclusively online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org|title=Disability Studies Quarterly - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDS has created a good model to follow when approaching publishers about their accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.disstudies.org/Publishing%20Accessible%20Books|title = Publishing Accessible Books|date = |access-date = 2016-02-16|website = Society for Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adam Newman organized the "Digital Access Facilitation Team" (DAFT)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success&lt;/ref&gt; to make the 2015 annual conference of the Society for Disability Studies more accessible for a wider range of attendees. DAFT is coordinated by the Society's Student Caucus, whose members are a group of 25-30 students of SDS. Working in teams of two, members of DAFT were live-tweeting every session, contingent upon the consent of presenters. Live-tweeting all sessions and following standards for that emerging media, allowed a new way of producing accessibility for the disability community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Access Facilitation Team - SDS 2015 {{!}} Adam Newman's Fundraiser|url = http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success|website = Crowdrise|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Society for Disability Studies, there are a number of caucuses which “designate groups that are under-represented within society or SDS as an organization.” DAFT is composed entirely of students (undergraduate, graduate, professional) who work on behalf of the interest and needs of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDS Student Caucus|url = http://sdsstudentcaucus.wordpress.com|website = SDS Student Caucus|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Membership ==
There are several options for membership opportunities, even if someone is unable to pay the membership fees they will not be turned away; "No one is denied membership in SDS due to an inability to pay an established membership fee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = join SDS {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/membership/join|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Two awards have been established by the society "to honor individuals who have shown dedication to Disability studies": the ''Senior Scholar Award'' and the ''Irving K. Zola Award for Emerging Scholars in Disability Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/awards|title=SDS Awards - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Senior Scholar Award'' is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of disability studies. Past award winners: Devva Kasnitz (2014), Richard Scotch (2013), Carol Gill (2012), Tobin Siebers (2011), Rosemarie Garland Thomson (2010), Elizabeth Depoy and Stephen Gilson (2009), and Steven J. Taylor (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/awards/sds-senior-scholar|title=SDS Senior Scholar - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the ''Irving K. Zola Award for Emerging Scholars in Disability Studies'' is awarded to an up and coming individual who also has made significant contributions to the field of disability studies.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of disaster''' is a special branch of [[sociology]].  The research is predominantly done in the United States, Germany and Italy.  Theoretically, it includes not only local [[disaster]]s, but catastrophes on a grand scale. The field is closely linked with [[environmental sociology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]].

== Overview ==
Many studies in the field of sociology of disaster focus on the link between social [[solidarity]] and the vulnerabilities exposed by disasters. Scholarship in this field has observed how such events can produce both social solidarity&lt;ref&gt;Barton AH. 1969. Communities in Disaster: A Sociological Analysis of Collective Stress. Garden City, NY: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabek TE. 1986. Human System Responses to Disaster. New York: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dynes RR. 1970. Organized Behavior in Disaster. Lexington, MA: Lexington Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor VA. 1977. Good news about disasters. Psychol. Today 5:93-94&lt;/ref&gt; and social conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Barry JM. 1997. Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton M. 1997. Recovery for whom? Social conflict after the San Francisco earthquake and fire, 1906-1915. PhD thesis. Univ. Calif., Davis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fradkin P. 2005. The Great Earthquake and Firestorms of 1906: How San Francisco Nearly Destroyed Itself. Berkeley: Univ. Calif. Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson AD. 2005. Reconstructing home: gender, disaster relief, and social life after the San Francisco earthquake and fire, 1906-1915. PhD thesis. Stanford Univ. Press, Stanford, CA. 278 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips B. 1998. Sheltering and housing of low-income and minority groups in Santa Cruz county after the Loma Prieta earthquake. In The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 11, 1989?Recovery, Mitigation, and Reconstruction, ed. JM Nigg, pp. D17-28. U.S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Pap. 1553D. Washington, DC: USGPO&lt;/ref&gt; and more importantly, expose inequalities inherent in the social order by exponentially exacerbating its effects.

Early disaster research established the mainstream parameters of what it is to do such research - i.e. a focus on solidarity arising in the aftermath of disasters and that disasters are a consequence of human maladaptation to the hazardous environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/60461618&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types and causes of disasters ==
*[[Natural disaster]] – a natural disaster is an event that occurs on its own due to the earth's regular processes. Some natural disasters can be predicted while others happen very suddenly. Injury, death and damage to personal or commercial property often occurs during these events. A few examples are tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Certain areas around the globe are prone to certain natural disasters.
*Human-made/technological disaster – these types of disaster are caused by the human race but can also be prevented by the human race. Advancements in technology are a wonderful thing but some uses of it can be very hazardous to life on earth. Extreme precautions must be taken in order to avoid most of these types of disasters. A few examples are chemical/nuclear, mass power outages and cyber attacks such as computer hacking.
*[[Terrorist attack]]s – a terrorist attack is an act of crime or violence that is directed towards a certain group or belief system. These attacks are usually provoked by political or religious reasons. These events usually include the use of violence that often occur in bodily injury and even loss of life. Some examples are 9/11, Boston marathon bomber and the beheading of multiple American reporters by ISIS

Natural disasters and terrorist attacks are the most common occurring types of disasters that affect the human population not only physically but mentally also. These types of disasters are the most detrimental to the morality of society and inflict a lot of mental stress and fear. People affected often have horrific flashbacks and can lead to self-harm and suicide is even possible.

== Behaviour before, during, and after disasters ==
In the sociology of disaster, human beings are naturally inclined to prepare for the odd event of disaster by buying supplies such as non-perishable foods, bottled water, basic medical supplies, sources of light and heat and batteries to operate such things. We stow these things away in an accessible place but we also have predetermined evacuation routes and ways of transportation to escape the area that will be affected in the coming hours or days if a reliable prediction of catastrophe is presented to us.
During the event of disaster, humans usually panic and become stressed out. This is predictable because many have seen the destruction that certain natural disasters can do. People often contact loved ones and try to seek shelter if they cannot avoid the upcoming disaster. Sometimes, nearby societies will prepare and gather supplies to help the people that are being affected by the disaster. Some organizations will try to help the best they can during the disaster and get people out of harm's way.
After disaster strikes people tend to act in many different ways. The community as a whole tries to help the affected victims but sometimes a few people can act out of the norm and act in criminal ways. Looting and shootings are often associated with disasters. Many organizations band together and provide relief. Communities eventually learn to adapt to the situation at hand and eventually start to thrive again.

==Positives of disasters==
:When cities experience different types of disasters it promotes social change and the coming together of communities in order to help one another. Once a community experiences a disaster they are able to learn and be prepared for the next possible disaster that could happen to them.

===Conflict Theory===
:The best scope to look at disaster's effect on society is through [[conflict theory]]. A conflict theorist believes that conflict is meant to happen in order to better society and help people to grow through competition and the inequalities between different people and groups.

==Socioeconomic status and disaster==
:Responding to an areas disaster can depend on many factors including the economic state of that area. Whether or not an area of people is well-off or poor tends to determine how fast they are re-developed and helped after a disaster. '''Socioeconomic status''' refers to an individual's position in a stratified social order. This system puts people into groups based on their income and wealth. Those groups consist of Upper Class, Middle Class/ Working Class, and the Lower class/ The Poor. When either of these classes experiences a social disaster there are differences in how well and fast they are helped. If a wealthy community experiences a disaster such as a flood they will most likely receive special treatment due to the way American society treats their poor communities as compared to their wealthy ones.

===Location===
====Urban Cities====
:Urban areas are especially at risk when it comes to disaster affecting them because of how they are viewed and taken care of by different groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of "Mission Survivability" whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the "survivability" of a platform through a complete mission, or the "survivability" of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of "Force Survivability" which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain "mission capable".

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of "crew survivability" is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment:

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

==Network==

===Definitions of network survivability===

Survivability is a subset of [[Resilience (network)|resilience]]."&lt;ref&gt;The [http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Survivability ResiliNets] Research Initiative definition of '''survivability'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Jabbar Mohammad, David Hutchison, and James P.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Textile stabilization''' is a [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|conservation method]] used to stabilize weak points in textile pieces and prevent further degradation or damage to the fabric. 

== Methods ==
=== Localized and Overall Support ===
Fabric may be used to provide support for the garment by stabilizing weak sections or by creating a backing or lining for the piece. Darning may be utilized on coarsely-woven fabrics with localized areas of damage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treatment of Textiles|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/TSG_Chapter_VI._Treatment_of_Textiles_-_Section_H._Consolidation/Stabilization_-_Non-adhesive_Methods|website=AIC Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Fabric Properties====  
*Should not cause damage through friction with the original fabric
*Be of similar or lighter weight than the original fabric.
*Match the original fabric with consideration of the loss of color or sheen
*Be of a tight enough weave to exclude dust if being used as a barrier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fabrics Used for Stabilization|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/fabrics_used_for_stabilization_from_aic.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Overlay ===
Translucent or sheer fabrics are used to stabilize the textile without altering its appearance. This is typically done using nylon netting, silk crepeline, or polyester Tetex. Overlay is generally applied to textiles too fragile to withstand localized stitching methods. Overlay materials may be stitched to a more stable backing fabric. 

== Materials and Techniques ==
=== Conservation Stitching ===
Careful stitching is used to secure stabilizing materials to the original fabric. 
*Whip Stitch
*[[Running stitch|Running Stitch]]
*[[Backstitch|Back Stitch]]
*[[Herringbone stitch|Herringbone Stitch]]
*[[Couching|Laid Couching]]
*[[Darning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Stitching Guide|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_stitching_guide.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nylon Netting ===
Textile Conservators may use either heat set or bobbinet netting, both of which do not fray but are susceptible to degradation and reactions from light. Netting may be used together with a backing fabric. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Netting|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_netting.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Heat Set ====
*Available in a variety of colors
*Some varieties are very stiff
==== Bobbinet====
*Available in fewer colors, but is easily dyed
*Has a better drape than heat set netting or Tetex

=== Silk Crepeline ===
[[Crepe (textile)|Silk Crepeline]]  Silk is less sheer than nylon netting and is also susceptible to reactions to light, but may be used as an overlay technique as well as for patching specific areas and can be easily dyed. Because it can fray, the edges need to be hemmed, which can create less sheer areas. 

=== Polyester Tetex (Stabiltex)=== 
The least sheer overlay material, Tetex also has a sheen and is available in a selected range of colors which are not easily dyed. The material does not require hemming but is the most difficult to drape over fabrics. It is most often chosen for its long term stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Cutting and Applying Sheer Overlays|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/hot_cutting_and_applying_polyester_sheer_overlays.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

==History==

The business was established in 2006 by Jeff Fairhall and Joe Whinney in the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood of Seattle. The business is located in a [[Fremont Trolley Barn|former brewery building and trolleycar depot]] at 3400 Phinney Avenue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Jeff Fairhall, the founder of Seattle's Essential Baking Company, invested in the establishment of Theo Chocolate with Joe Whinney.&lt;ref name=richman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Jeff-Fairhall-1958-2007-Entrepreneur-pioneered-1250121.php |title=Jeff Fairhall, 1958-2007: Entrepreneur pioneered healthful food to go - seattlepi.com |first=Dan |last=Richman |work=seattlepi.com |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairhallobit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003894838_fairhallobit21m.html |title=Local News &amp;#124; Jeff Fairhall, owner of Essential Baking Co., dies at 49 |first=Susan |last=Gilmore |work=seattletimes.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in his early 20s, Whinney volunteered with a small conservation foundation in Southern [[Belize]] that was looking at the way that communities cultivated their crops. He developed a passion for the [[Theobroma cacao]] plant and wanted to get into the business while supporting the farmers, and contacted 10 bean processors. One responded. While providing this business with organic materials and customers, Whinney was able to start saving up to found a chocolate business of his own.&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt;

The business struggled to find a good supply of organic cocoa beans and came to a halt in 2002. After finding an interested investor in [[Seattle, Washington]], the decision was made to build the Theo Chocolate factory, named after the Theobroma cacao tree.&lt;ref name= Fair /&gt;

From 2004 to 2006 Fairhall sold all of his other business interests, retaining only Theo Chocolate. He published more than 30 advertisements in ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' about various religious ideas, revelations, and conspiracy theories. He also mentioned his use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].&lt;ref name=richman/&gt; Fairhall died of brain cancer in 2007.&lt;ref name=richman/&gt;

In April 2018, Etienne Patout, a former Kellogg's executive, became the company's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2018/04/13/Theo-Chocolate-names-former-Kellogg-exec-as-CEO&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12976">'''Toxicogenomics''' is a subdiscipline of [[pharmacology]] that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about [[gene]] and [[protein]] activity within a particular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of an [[organism]] in response to exposure to [[toxin|toxic substances]]. Toxicogenomics combines [[toxicology]] with [[genomics]] or other high-throughput molecular profiling technologies such as [[transcriptomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=The National Academies Press|title= Communicating Toxicogenomics Information to Nonexperts: A Workshop Summary |year=2005|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11179&amp;page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications | veditors = Hamadeh HK, Afshari CA | year = 2004 | publisher = Wiley-Liss | location  =Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 0-471-43417-5 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Omenn GS | title = Book Review: Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | volume = 112 | issue = 16 | pages = A962 | date  =November 2004 | pmc = 1247673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicogenomics endeavors to elucidate the molecular mechanisms evolved in the expression of toxicity, and to derive molecular expression patterns (i.e., molecular [[biomarker]]s) that predict toxicity or the genetic susceptibility to it.

In pharmaceutical research, toxicogenomics is defined as the study of the structure and function of the [[genome]] as it responds to adverse xenobiotic exposure. It is the toxicological subdiscipline of [[pharmacogenomics]], which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] maps, [[haplotype]] markers, and alterations in [[gene expression]] that might correlate with drug responses.&lt;ref name="pmid15340386"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesko LJ, Woodcock J | title = Translation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics: a regulatory perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

The term is still not universally accepted, and others have offered alternative terms such as ''chemogenomics'' to describe essentially the same field of study.&lt;ref name="pmid15952870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fielden MR, Pearson C, Brennan R, Kolaja KL | title = Preclinical drug safety analysis by chemogenomic profiling in the liver | journal = American Journal of Pharmacogenomics : Genomics-related Research in Drug Development and Clinical Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952870 | doi = 10.2165/00129785-200505030-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and complexity of the data (in volume and variability) demands highly developed processes of automated handling and storage. The analysis usually involves a wide array of [[bioinformatics]] and [[statistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattes WB, Pettit SD, Sansone SA, Bushel PR, Waters MD | title = Database development in toxicogenomics: issues and efforts | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 495–505 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15033600 | pmc = 1241904 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.6697 | url = http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171519/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | archivedate = 2008-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; often including [[statistical classification]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H, Gmuender H, Bandenburg A, Ahr HJ | title = Prediction of a carcinogenic potential of rat hepatocarcinogens using toxicogenomics analysis of short-term in vivo studies | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 637 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–39 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17689568 | doi = 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.06.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|development]], toxicogenomics is used to study possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse]] (i.e. [[toxic]]) effects of pharmaceutical [[drug]]s in defined [[model organism|model systems]] in order to draw conclusions on the toxic risk to patients or the environment. Both the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) currently preclude basing regulatory decision-making on genomics data alone. However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data on a case-by-case basis for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicological test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corvi R, Ahr HJ, Albertini S, Blakey DH, Clerici L, Coecke S, Douglas GR, Gribaldo L, Groten JP, Haase B, Hamernik K, Hartung T, Inoue T, Indans I, Maurici D, Orphanides G, Rembges D, Sansone SA, Snape JR, Toda E, Tong W, van Delft JH, Weis B, Schechtman LM | title = Meeting report: Validation of toxicogenomics-based test systems: ECVAM-ICCVAM/NICEATM considerations for regulatory use | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16507466 | pmc = 1392237 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8247 | url = http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017084247/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | archivedate = 2008-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Twice-Exceptional Dilemma.''Washington D.C.:NEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although 2e can refer to any general disability, it is often used to refer to students with learning disabilities, although research is not limited to these areas, and a more holistic view of 2e can help move the field forward&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramo|first=Joseph|date=June 2015|title=Gifted Students with Disabilities "Twice Exceptionality in the Classroom"|url=|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=4|pages=62-69|via=nafme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;The disabilities are varied: [[dyslexia]], visual or [[auditory processing disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[sensory processing disorder]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Tourette Syndrome]], or any other disability interfering with the student's ability to learn effectively in a traditional environment.&lt;ref name="National Education Association 2006"/&gt; The child might have a diagnosis of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], or diagnoses of [[anxiety]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with Learning Disabilities: A Review of the Issues|date=1997|publisher=Journal of Learning Disabilities|pages=282–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often children with 2e have multiple co-morbid disabilities that present as a paradox to many parents and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear-cut profile of twice-exceptional children because the nature and disabilities of twice exceptionality are so varied.  This variation among twice-exceptional children makes it difficult to determine just how many of them there might be.  Best estimates of prevalence range from 300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Strategies for helping bright students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 360,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Association for Gifted Children &amp; Council of State Directors of Programs for Gifted|title=State of the states in gifted education:  National policy and practical data|date=2011|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. (on the order of 0.5% of the total number of children under 18&lt;ref&gt;"In 2013, there were nearly 74 million children younger than 18 in the United States."

Linda Silverman, Ph.D., the director of the Gifted Development Center has found that fully 1/6 of the gifted children tested at the GDC have a learning difference of some type.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Linda [www.gifteddevelopment.com/What_is_Gifted/learned.htm "What We Have Learned About Gifted Children"],''Gifted Development Center'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, in 2010 a conservative estimate of the prevalence of 2e children was around 40,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270894725_An_Empirical_investigation_of_twice-exceptional_research_in_Australia_Prevalence_estimates_for_gifted_children_with_disability|title=An Empirical investigation of twice-exceptional research in Australia: Prevalence estimates for gifted children with disability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/2.1.1456.4160|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or approximately 10% of gifted Australian children, although other estimates have placed this much higher at 30% of gifted Australian children as being 2e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=DR John|date=2002-06-01|title=Gifted learning disabled students|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19404150209546698|journal=Australian Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=7|issue=2|pages=20–30|doi=10.1080/19404150209546698|issn=1324-8928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misunderstood children==

Brody and Mills [1997] argue that this population of students "could be considered the most misunderstood of all exceptionalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with learning disabilities: a review of the issues|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=1997|volume=30|issue=3|pages=282–296|doi=10.1177/002221949703000304|pmid=9146095}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each situation, the 2e student’s strengths help to compensate for deficits; the deficits, on the other hand, make the child’s strengths less apparent &lt;ref&gt;Baum, S. &amp; Owen, S. (2004). To Be Gifted &amp; Learning Disabled: Strategies for Helping Bright Students with LD, ADHD, and More. Mansfield Center, CT: Creative Learning Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although as yet there is no empirical research to confirm this theory. The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:
* Bright but not trying hard enough
* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities
* Average.
In the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.
A 2e student’s grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn’t trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.
This struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.

==Identifying twice exceptionality==
Twice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments. The following chart summarizes characteristics commonly seen in this population.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Twice-Exceptionality: Parents’ Perspectives on 2e Identification|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02783193.2015.1077911|journal = Roeper Review|date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0278-3193|pages = 208–218|volume = 37|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/02783193.2015.1077911|first = Lynn|last = Dare|first2 = Elizabeth Agnes|last2 = Nowicki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice exceptionality often does not show up until children are in school. In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student’s performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.

If these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation results should indicate the child’s areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–36|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Their strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or 504 plan.

Support can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child’s areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. It should be remembered, however, that the student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.

==Education==
Twice-exceptional education is a movement that started in the early 1970s with "gifted-handicapped" education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maker |first = C. June |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL4559927M/Providing_programs_for_the_gifted_handicapped |title = Providing programs for the gifted handicapped |year = 1977 |publisher=Council for Exceptional Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term essentially referring to the same population. 2e education is an education approach backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students. It is a marriage between special education and gifted education—a strengths-based, differentiated approach that provides special educational supports. Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward "big picture" learning. It's also important to understand that these students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended. 

Still, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose alternative educational options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, L. C. (2008). No One Said It was Easy – Challenges of Parenting Twice-Exceptional Children. In M. W. Gosfield, (Ed.), ''Expert Approaches to Support Gifted Learners: Professional Perspectives, Best Practices, and Positive Solutions'' (pp. 269-276). Minneapolis: Free Spirit Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of schools in United States offer a curriculum specifically tailored to 2e children. Some public schools offer part-time programs for twice exceptional students, where they can progress in subjects like math at their own pace, and meet other students like themselves.

'''Women's Studio Workshop (WSW)''' is a nonprofit visual [[arts studio]] and [[private press]] offering residencies and educational workshops, located in [[Rosendale, New York]].

The workshop was founded in 1974 by Ann Kalmbach, [[Tatana Kellner]], Anita Wetzel, and Barbara Leoff Burge as an alternative space for female artists to create new work, gain artistic experience, and develop new skills. The studio operates throughout the year with artist residencies, gallery exhibitions, artist lectures, and diverse educational programs for children and adults. In addition, they operate a Summer Art Institute which includes options to study abroad. The studio supports projects in a wide range of media types, with a focus on [[Book Art|book arts]], [[Paper making|papermaking]], and printmaking methods: [[screen printing]], [[letterpress]], [[etching]], [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]. 

WSW is the largest publisher of [[Artist's book|artists' books]] in North America. {{CN|date=August 2018}} The workshop is represented in book arts and special collections of notable libraries, such as the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Library of Congress Acquires Rosendale Women’s Studio Handmade Book Collection. | date=6 June  2013 | type=Print  | newspaper=Hudson Valley Business Journal | pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book as Art: Artists' Books from the National Museum of Women in the Arts|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=9781568989921|pages=79–81|author=Krystyna Wasserman|author2=Joanna Drucker |author3=Audrey Audrey Niffenegger |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dexter Library, [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and James Branch Cabell Library, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].[http://www.library.vcu.edu/research/special-collections/cabell/book-art/] Editions by visiting artists published by the Women's Studio Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hand, voice &amp; vision : artists' books from Women's Studio Workshop|year=2010|publisher=Women's Studio Workshop,|location=Rosendale, N.Y.|url=http://handvoicevision.com/|author=Kathy Walkup|author2=Grolier Club. |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been featured in overview exhibitions and symposiums on contemporary book arts such as the Codex Book Fair and Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book art object|publisher=Codex Foundation|pages=355–357; 382;417|author=David Jury|author2=Peter Rutledge Koch |year=2008|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pyramid Atlantic]] Book Arts Fair.

== The Artists' Book Collection ==
The artists' books produced at the studio cover a range of topics from the political to the personal. The books come in a variety of forms, ranging from interactive puzzles that must be assembled to accordion folded books to books made with a variety of mixed media.

Todd was born to a [[Métis]] father and white settler mother in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1983.

'''Åbo Akademi University''' ({{lang-sv|'''Åbo Akademi'''}} {{IPA-sv|ˈoːbʊ akadɛˈmiː|}}) is the only exclusively [[Swedish language]] multi-faculty [[university]] in [[Finland]] (or anywhere outside [[Sweden]]). It is located mainly in [[Turku]] (Åbo is the Swedish name of the city) but has also activities in [[Vaasa]]. It is said to have one of the most prestigious business programs in the world (in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Dichev, Ilia D. "How good are business school rankings?." The Journal of Business 72.2 (1999): 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Åbo Akademi should not be confused with the [[The Royal Academy of Turku|Royal Academy of Åbo]], which was founded in 1640, but moved to [[Helsinki]] after the [[Great Fire of Turku|Turku fire]] of 1827 and is today known as the [[University of Helsinki]].

Åbo Akademi was founded by private donations in 1918 as the third university in Finland, both to let Turku again become a university town and because it was felt that the Swedish language was threatened at the University of Helsinki. The Finnish [[University of Turku]] was founded in 1920, also by private donations and for similar reasons. Åbo Akademi was a private institution until 1981, when it was turned into a public institution. 

As the only uni-lingually Swedish multi-faculty university in the world outside Sweden and consequently the only one in Finland, Åbo Akademi University is responsible for higher education for a large proportion of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking population]]. This role has many implications for education and research as well as for the social environment. As there are few students in most subjects, cooperation between faculties and with other universities is very important.

A significant minority of the students are Finnish-speaking. While Turku in itself is mostly Finnish, the university provides a strong Swedish environment. Most of the students, regardless of original language, will be functionally bilingual when finishing their studies.

The university has a policy that non-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] speaking applicants from the [[Nordic countries]] are required to participate in a Swedish language test, in order to prove their ability to successfully study in Swedish. Applicants from non-Nordic countries can, however, choose between [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or [[English language]] tests.

== Organisation ==
The university consists of four faculties:
*Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology (located in Turku)
*Faculty of Education and Welfare Studies (located in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Science and Engineering (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Social Sciences, Business and Economics (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)

In addition, there are several other units and joint programs, such as:
* Language Centre
* Centre for Lifelong Learning
* [[Donner Institute]] for Research in Religious and Cultural History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner institute|url=http://www.abo.fi/forskning/donnerska_institutet|work=Åbo Akademi University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Institute of Human Rights
* Turku PET Centre (jointly run by [[University of Turku|Turku University]], Åbo Akademi and the [[TYKS|Turku University Hospital]])
* [[Tucs|Turku Centre for Computer Science (TUCS)]] (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* Turku Centre for Biotechnology (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* [[Vasa övningsskola]], located in [[Vaasa]], is the [[normal school]] of the teacher training programme.

When the university was turned into a public institution the foundation Stiftelsen för Åbo Akademi remained. Besides maintaining many of the university buildings, it is also a significant donor. Because of new legislation regarding higher education, it is planned to turn universities in Finland into semi-private institutions.
