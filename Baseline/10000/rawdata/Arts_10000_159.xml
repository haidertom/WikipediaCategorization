'''''ARTnews''''' is an American visual-arts magazine, based in [[New York City]]. It covers art from ancient to [[Post-modernism|contemporary]] times. It includes news dispatches from correspondents, investigative reports, reviews of exhibitions, and profiles of artists and collectors.

==History and operations==
The magazine was founded by James Clarence Hyde in 1902 as '''''Hydes Weekly Art News''''' and was originally published eleven times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Serial Publications Founded Prior to 1918 and Now Or Recently Current in Boston, Cambridge, and Vicinity|last=Homer|first=Thomas Johnston|publisher=Trustees of the Public Library|year=1922|isbn=|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=20|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qVEAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=rVDu3_6L2G&amp;dq=artnews%201902&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=artnews%201902&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/mcleans_1902.pdf "McLean’s 1902 Letter"] [[PDF|PDF format]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

From vol. 3, no. 52 (November 5, 1904) to vol. 21, no. 18 (February 10, 1923), the magazine was published as '''''American Art News'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Serial Publications Founded Prior to 1918 and Now Or Recently Current in Boston, Cambridge, and Vicinity|last=Homer|first=Thomas Johnston|publisher=Trustees of the Public Library|year=1922|isbn=|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=20|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qVEAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=rVDu3_6L2G&amp;dq=artnews%201902&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=artnews%201902&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;From February 1923 to the present, the magazine has been published as ''The Art News'' then ''ARTnews''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/746445 ARTNews], National Library of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's [[art critic]]s and correspondents include [[Arthur Danto]], Linda Yablonsky, Barbara Pollock, Margarett Loke, Hilarie Sheets, [[Yale School of Art]] dean [[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]],&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).

In April 2014, Milton and Judith Esterow, the magazine's owners since 1972, sold the publication to Skate Capital Corp., a private asset-management firm owned by Sergey Skaterschikov.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}--&gt;{{registration required|date=August 2014}} Cohen, Patricia (April 8, 2014).

==The ''ARTNews'' Top 200 Collectors==
The ''ARTNews'' Top 200 list is released annually and contains the top individual art collectors from around the world based on interviews with collectors, curators, dealers, auction houses, and museums. Those on the list are also surveyed, and their responses are used to inform trends and provide data, such as a breakdown of where the most top art collectors live (the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/11/where-do-the-worlds-top-art-collectors-live/|title=Where do the world's top art collectors live|last=|first=|date=|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  

Collectors on the list are profiled with a brief biography focused on the type of art that they collect (contemporary, post war, modern, etc.) and includes their city or cities of residence, a photo, their source of wealth and the years they have been on the Top 200 list, as many collectors are on it for multiple years.

'''A Needle Woman''' is a performance video artwork created by artist [[Kimsooja]]. The videos projected simultaneously that comprise [[Kimsooja]]’s ''A Needle Woman'' (1999) presents the artist wearing precisely the same clothes, standing precisely the same way, and, it would seem, at the same time of day in various urban environments.&lt;ref name=Madoff&gt;Madoff, Steven Henry, “Gnomon of Place, Gnomon of foreignness.” Host &amp; Guest catalogue for group exhibition at Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
A Needle Woman premiered at CCA Kitakyushu in 1999. In the Kitakyshu version the artist presented a video channel where she lied on top of a rock formation, as Kimsooja explained “When I was invited to make a new commissioned work at the Center for Contemporary Art in Kitakyushu, Japan, I thought I would do a performance piece - one in the city of Tokyo, and the other one in nature. Then I would juxtapose them together. (…) As a result one was standing still in the middle of a crowd, while the other was lying down on a rock, facing nature. Verticality and horizontality were a metaphor for a dynamic balance between urban and natural forces.” &lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Commandeur, Kimsooja: Black holes, Meditative Vanishings and Nature as a Mirror of the Universe, in Windflower, Perceptions of Nature, NAI and Kroller-Muller Museum ,2012&lt;/ref&gt;In further installations of ''A Needle Woman'' Kimsooja focused on the urban aspect of the work and shot a number of new videos where she stood absolutely still, her back facing the camera, amid passing crowds of inhabitants in Patan, Nepal; Havana, Cuba; N’Djamena, Chad; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sana’a, Yemen; Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref name=Madoff/&gt; 

Kimsooja in these videos is often described as a nomadic figure traveling across the world to come to rest in a crowded thoroughfare. The Needle referred to in the title is Kimsooja theorizing herself as a needle passing through the fabric of a place and its people. A common feature of the locations visited in the work is that they are all places of violence, disrepair or unresolved conflict; lending to the needle a metaphoric function as an instrument of suture and healing.&lt;ref name=Madoff/&gt; Subsequent versions of ''A Needle Woman'' were shown at [[MoMA PS1]] Contemporary art center in 2001, at the [[Kunsthalle Bern]] in Bern Switzerland in 2001, for the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] as part of the [[Arsenale]] in 2005, and was projected as a single channel public art project for La Nuit Blanche on the facade of [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], Paris in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kimsooja Biography: http://www.kimsooja.com/biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Batlló Majesty''''' ({{lang-ca|Majestat Batlló}}, {{IPA-ca|məʒəsˈtad bəˈʎːo|pron}}) is a large 12th-century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] wooden [[crucifix]], now in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. It is one of the most elaborate examples in [[Catalonia]] of an image of Christ on the Cross symbolizing his triumph over death.

== History ==
The Batlló Majesty is a 12th-century Romanesque [[polychrome]] wood carving now in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in Barcelona, [[Catalonia]]. The Batlló Majesty is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of these Catalan sculptures. Carved wooden images were a fundamental element in churches as objects of worship. One of the most elaborate types in Catalonia was the [[Christ in Majesty]], images of Christ on the Cross that symbolize his triumph over death, of which the most outstanding is the Batlló Majesty. The frontal geometric composition of the [[tunic]] decorated in circles and floral motifs is reminiscent of the refined [[Byzantine]] and Hispano-Moorish fabrics held in such high esteem in the Christian West during this time. The great reference for this type was the [[Volto Santo]] in [[Lucca]]  ([[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]), which was regarded as having miraculous origins and was the object of [[pilgrimage]] and extraordinary devotion from the end of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/?&amp;lang=en Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 11th century wood sculpture flourished in Catalonia. Carvers used four main formats to represent the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]:
# 'Calvaries' where [[Jesus]] is represented on the cross with [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].
# 'Deposition Tableaux', or figures of the good and bad thieves [[Mary Magdalene]], [[John the Apostle]], [[Nicodemus]], and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]
# 'Majestats' where large wooden crucifixes showed a triumphant Christ wearing a [[colobium]] (a long sleeveless tunic).
# 'Nude Majestats' where Christ is wearing only a [[perizonium]] (loincloth).&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "A Monumental Catalan Crucifix", Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit. 1997, LXXI, 1-2, p.52, fig.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood carving workshops were still active in the 12th century in the western part of the region in the high valleys of the [[Pyrenees]] in Catalonia. There are over thirty examples of these large crucifixes, called ''majestats''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt; The Batlló Majesty has been linked to the region of [[Olot]] near Girona. As with much [[medieval art]], its creator is unknown, although a medieval legend credits [[Nicodemus]] with producing the sculpture soon after the actual [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], a pious tradition repeated elsewhere in Europe in connection with similar monumental crosses, like the better known Volto Santo in the church of San Martino, Lucca, to which they bear a notable similarity in appearance and date, these Catalan crucifixes were believed to have miraculous powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrud Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art. Volume 2. The Passion of Jesus Christ.'' Janet Seligman (tr.), Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1972: 144-5, 472-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of majestats still exist from the Catalan provinces of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Lleida]], and the French province of [[Roussillon]], such that some scholars believe these are monumental crosses once hung in almost every [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church built in these regions as [[rood cross]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the ''Majestats'' were the focus of an important and popular cult veneration in these regions as early as the tenth century. They were normally hung near portals of the churches or altars dedicated to the Savior. Often the backs of the majestats were painted with the [[Agnus Dei]] and the Evangelist's symbols suggesting that these crosses were also carried in processions.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably it comes from a church in the district of [[Garrotxa]] (Girona). It entered the museum's collection donated by Enric Batlló to the [[Province of Barcelona]] on a permanent loan, 1914. Its inventory Number is 015937-000.

== Description ==
[[File:Majestat Batlló.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the ''corpus'']]
The cross was procured for the museum in 1914 by the collector Enric Batlló, for whom the piece is now named. It was also the same family that commissioned the construction of Casa Batlló in 1877 Barcelona, Catalonia.  At the time of its first arrival at the museum, it was covered with a thick coating of [[varnish]] that obscured but helped preserve its bright colors, which have now been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Trens, M., (1966) Les majestats catalanes, ( Monumenta Cataloniae, XIII) Barcelona p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have revealed the pigments used to produce the colors: the red from [[cinnabar]] and the blue from [[lapis lazuli]]. Both pigments were very expensive and the sculpture is believed to have come from a studio of some importance perhaps the studio around the monastery of [[Ripoll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/?&amp;lang=en Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
The Batlló Majesty presents Christ bearing his suffering with noble stoicism. It is a triumphant Christ wearing a [[colobium]], or a long, sleeveless tunic. Although the corners of his mouth turn slightly downward, Christ's open eyes and unfurrowed brow create the impression of a self-possessed impassivity. One of the striking features of the Batlló Majesty compared to others, is the well-conserved polychromy. Christ’s colobium, in imitation of rich oriental silk, is decorated with blue floral designs surrounded by circular red frames embellished with dots and circles. A thin belt with an elaborate [[interlace (art)|interlace]] knot pulls the tunic in above Christ’s hips, making the fabric above it swell out slightly and curving the path of its flat, wide vertical folds. Such robes, called [[colobium]]s are linked with royal and priestly functions and provide a message of strength to the viewing audience. They can be seen as a visualization of image of the Apocalyptic Christ from the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Gertrud , Iconography of Cristian Art, Volume II, (1972) London, {{ISBN|0853313245}}, pp.144-145&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition of Jesus in a colobium dates to 586 in a manuscript of the Syriac Gospels called the [[Rabbula Gospels]], written by the [[monk]] Rabbula somewhere in [[Mesopotamia]].  It is thought that the tradition of depicting Christ in such costume was brought to Catalonia by artisans from [[Pisa]] who arrived in 1114 to help [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]] in his conquest of the [[Balearic Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;PIJOÁN, José, (1927), Historia general del arte, Volumen IX, colección Summa Artis. El arte románico siglos XI y XII, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin inscription above his head reads, "JHS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM" ("Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews”) as in biblical accounts ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 27:37, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:26, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:38, [[Gospel of John|John]] 19:19).

== Chronology ==
The chronology of the Batlló Majesty is difficult to date, but the inscription on the cross and the painting could be placed in the eleventh century, although other authors dating back to the twelfth century based on the painting’s similarity to ones seen in the area of Ripoll, mid-twelfth century, which is used as an argument to support this dating, and can now be placed into 1150. The tunic also has an analogy with an Islamic motif abacus of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Pierre de [[Moissac]], which seems to prove the spread during the Romanesque period.

'''''Black Like Me''''' (1964) is an American drama film based on the book ''[[Black Like Me]]'' by [[John Howard Griffin]]. The journalist disguised himself to pass as an African-American man for six weeks in 1959 in the Deep South to report on life in the segregated society from the other side of the color line. The film was directed by [[Gerda Lerner|Carl Lerner]] and the screenplay was written by Carl and [[Gerda Lerner]]. The film stars [[James Whitmore]], [[Sorrell Booke]] and [[Roscoe Lee Browne]].

The DVD was released December 11, 2012 in North America from Video Services Corp. The DVD includes a documentary titled ''Uncommon Vision'' about John Howard Griffin, the journalist on which the main character is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/59958/black-like-me|title=Black Like Me: DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2013|website=DVD Talk|last=Hartel|first=Nick|at=The DVD: The Extras|deadurl=no|quote=The film's bonus disc features a 60-min feature length documentary, ''Uncommon Vision: The Life and Times of John Howard Griffin'' on the film's real-life subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Critical reception for the film has been mixed. Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' described the film as "melodramatic and unsubtle". He said it failed to place the viewer inside a Negro's skin, and to convince the audience that the protagonist "is truly passing for black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the film after the 2012 DVD release, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a positive 3 out of 4 stars. He said that, although some aspects of the film felt dated, the film's themes were still timely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Maltin, Leonard]]|title=Leonard Maltin's 2014 Movie Guide|date=2014|publisher=[[Penguin Press]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-451-41810-4|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

'''''Booknotes''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[television series]] on the [[C-SPAN]] [[television network|network]] hosted by [[Brian Lamb]], which originally aired from 1989 to 2004.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite news |title='Booknotes' Afterword |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format of the show is a one-hour, one-on-one [[interview]] with a [[non-fiction]] author.&lt;ref name=Heltzel&gt;{{cite news |title=Books On TV, and a Host Who Listens |author=Ellen Emry Heltzel |newspaper=The Sunday Oregonian |date=17 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was broadcast at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] each Sunday night,&lt;ref name=Prial&gt;{{cite news |title=After Many Million Pages, 'Booknotes' Ends Its Run |author=Frank J.

==Background and production==

===History===
''Booknotes'' debuted on April 2, 1989. The first guest was former [[United States National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], discussing ''The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century''.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite news |title=Books on TV: a time line |author=Dave Wilcox |newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |date=September 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth anniversary was marked on April 10, 1994 with a special two-hour show featuring over 50 of the 300 authors previously featured on the program.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite news |title='Booknotes' Series Marks 5th Chapter With C-SPAN Special |author=Frazier Moore |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=9 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the tenth anniversary of ''Booknotes'' in 1999, Brian Lamb compiled and edited an anthology of stories on 78 people who influenced American history from the 18th century to 1999. Titled ''Booknotes: Life Stories'', each contributed story was written by a well-known biographer.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee&gt;{{cite news |title=There's no time for TV for C-SPAN founder Lamb |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=25 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 801 interviews, the final broadcast aired December 5, 2004.&lt;ref name=Prial/&gt; Lamb's guest was [[Mark Edmundson]], author of ''Why Read?'', professor of English at the [[University of Virginia]] and a contributing editor at ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=Biffle&gt;{{cite news |title=The Last Author Of One Last Book For One Final Hour |author=Tony Biffle |newspaper=The Sun Herald |date= 5 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was intended to end with the 800th episode, but due to a miscalculation, the final program was actually the 801st.&lt;ref name=Biffle/&gt;

''Booknotes'' segments continue to be re-aired on [[C-SPAN]]'s companion network C-SPAN 2, during Saturday ''[[Book TV]]'' broadcasts,&lt;ref name=Advocate&gt;{{cite news |title="Booknotes" was benefit for books |newspaper=The Advocate  |date=11 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while C-SPAN 3 airs repeat segments every weeknight at 11 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]. All 801 transcripts are available online&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; and the 801 shows can be viewed online via the ''Booknotes'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booknotes.org/home/index.asp |title=Booknotes archive |work=Booknotes.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb's own copies of the ''Booknotes'' books, most of which contain his personal [[marginalia]], are housed in the rare books collection of [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite news |title=In Brian Lamb's 'Booknotes' marginalia, a record of our time's serious thoughts |author=John Kelly |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/in-brian-lambs-booknotes-marginalia-a-record-of-our-times-serious-thoughts/2011/09/21/gIQA8EwzlK_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The ''Booknotes'' concept grew out of a one-off interview special with [[Neil Sheehan]], author of ''[[A Bright Shining Lie]]'', in September 1988.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee/&gt; The interview itself resulted from Lamb having viewed a short [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] interview with Sheehan and wanting to hear more.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee/&gt; According to Lamb, a strong viewer response to the program led to the decision to start producing a weekly author interview program.&lt;ref name=Prial/&gt;

===Format===
Each ''Booknotes'' episode devoted one full hour to an interview with the author of a recently released non-fiction book.&lt;ref name="Heltzel"/&gt; In order to avoid duplicate appearances by any one author, each guest appeared only once on the program,&lt;ref name=Prial/&gt; thus allowing for over 800 different authors to be interviewed every week over a fifteen-year stretch. The hour-long interviews explored authors' work habits, thoughts and lives, while also covering the intentions of their book and how, or if, these were achieved.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heltzel"/&gt;

===Production===
Research for the interviews was simple: producers identified subjects, arranged for them to appear and Brian Lamb would then read the book in the week prior to the interview.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee/&gt; One reason for discontinuing the series, according to Lamb, was the time constraints imposed by reading an entire book every seven days.&lt;ref name=Prial/&gt;

The set where ''Booknotes'' was recorded was similarly basic, comprising a black backdrop, two armchairs and a coffee table.&lt;ref name=Advocate/&gt;

===Awards===
In February 2003, Lamb was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neh.gov/news/report2002/medals.html|title= National Humanities Medal|accessdate=15 November 2008 |work= 2002 Annual Report|publisher= [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Lamb received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for his work on C-SPAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Citations Recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom|url= https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/11/20071105-7.html|publisher= The White House: Official Site|date= 5 November 2007|accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Historical Association]] awarded Lamb the 2004 Theodore Roosevelt-Woodrow Wilson Award  "for extraordinary contributions to the study, teaching, and public understanding of history."&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historians.org/prizes/AWARDED/RooseveltWilsonWinner/04Lamb.cfm announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guests==
Notable guests appearing on ''Booknotes'' to discuss their published writings have included [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Frank McCourt]] and [[David Crosby]].&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; A number of former presidents have appeared on the program, including [[Richard Nixon]] on February 23, 1992, [[Jimmy Carter]] on February 19, 1995 and [[Bill Clinton]] on December 15, 1996.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt; In addition to the U.S. presidents who were interviewed for ''Booknotes'', former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] also appeared on the program.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

While the majority of ''Booknotes'' subjects have been authors of books on history, politics or public policy, exceptions included the violinist [[Isaac Stern]], who discussed his memoir, ''My First 79 Years'', on the program on January 23, 2000.&lt;ref name=Prial/&gt;

==Books==
Including ''Booknotes: Life Stories'', four books have been drawn from the series, with content either comprising original material or taken directly from transcripts of ''Booknotes'' interviews.&lt;ref name=Biffle/&gt; ''Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading, Writing and the Power of Ideas'' is a compilation of short monologues taken from the transcripts of Brian Lamb’s best interviews.&lt;ref name=Heltzel/&gt; The other two books are ''Booknotes: On American Character'' and ''Booknotes: Stories from American History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booknotes.org/home/index.asp |title=Booknotes Books |work=Booknotes.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buzzy Bee''' is a popular [[toy]] in [[New Zealand]]. It resembles a [[bee]] with rotating [[wing]]s that move and make a clicking noise while the toy is pulled along the ground. Possibly based on an earlier American concept,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_9661"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=9661 |title=Nasty sting in the tale of 'our' Buzzy Bee icon |date=8 July 1999 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was designed and first produced in New Zealand in the 1930s, by [[Maurice Schlesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tony (2007). ''101 Incredible Kiwis: How New Zealanders Lead the World.'' Auckland: Reed Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular during the [[post-war]] [[baby boom]]. Its bright colours and clicking sound call are familiar to many New Zealanders, making it one of the most well-recognised items of [[Kiwiana]].   Since this time however, the Buzzy Bee has branched out into various merchandise including books, jigsaws and clothing.

It received a good deal of free promotion with the visit of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] in 1983 with their infant son, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]], who played with a Buzzy Bee.

As an iconic New Zealand symbol, the Buzzy Bee caricature was used on the keel of NZL84, one of [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Team New Zealand]]'s entrant yachts for the [[America's Cup]] held in [[Valencia, Spain]], in 2007.

In June 2007, plans were unveiled for a Buzzy Bee stage show ''"Buzzy Bee's Big Day Out"''. The company behind the show also revealed that they'd made an animated show reel and were finalising details of a distribution deal, and that they hoped to begin work on an animated series for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/author/story.cfm?a_id=328&amp;objectid=10441111 |title=Multi-million dollar Buzzy Bee stage show to hit the road |author=Joanna Hunkin |publisher=NZ Herald |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The animated TV show ''Buzzy Bee and Friends'' has aired on TV2 from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Show |url=https://buzzybeetv.com/videos/tv/ |work=Buzzy Bee and friends |publisher=Lion Rock Ventures |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208061906/https://buzzybeetv.com/videos/tv/ |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fisher-Price]] manufactured Buzzy Bees from 1950 to 1956.  [http://www.thisoldtoy.com/new-images/images-ok/300-399/fp325-bee.jpg Buzzy Bee] was originally covered with paper lithographs depicting a yellow bee with pink cheeks, blue eyes, and striped tail. The bee had two spring antennae topped with red beads.  Yellow acetate wings rotated and the toy made a "buzz-buzz" sound as it was pulled along on two wooden wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisoldtoy.com/L_FP_Set/toy-pages/300-399/325-buzzybee.html Buzzy Bee] This Old Toy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, Mark. ''Warman's 101 Greatest Baby Boomer Toys.'' kp books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Buzzy Bee cost $.59 and was Fisher-Price's first toy to feature plastic.  The toy was retired for a few years but returned in 1956 as Queen Buzzy Bee wearing a polyethylene crown. Queen Buzzy was manufactured through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

The '''Celtic calendar''' is a compilation of pre-Christian Celtic systems of timekeeping, including the [[Coligny calendar|Gaulish Coligny calendar]], used by [[Celtic countries]] to define the beginning and length of the day, the week, the month, the seasons, quarter days, and festivals.&lt;ref name="Koch 330"&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO (2006). Page 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continental Celtic calendar==
The [[Gaulish]] [[Coligny calendar]] is possibly the oldest Celtic solar/lunar ritual calendar. It was discovered in [[Coligny, Ain|Coligny]], France, and is now on display in the Palais des Arts [[Gallo-Roman]] museum, Lyon. It dates from the end of the second century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Duval, P.M. and Pinault, G., Recueil des inscriptions gauloises, Tome 3: Les Calendriers (Coligny, Villards d'Heria), CNRS, Paris, 1986, pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Roman Empire imposed the use of the [[Julian Calendar]] in [[Roman Gaul]]. The calendar is made up of bronze fragments, in a single huge plate. It is inscribed in Gaulish with Latin characters and uses [[Roman numerals]].

The Coligny Calendar is an attempt to reconcile the cycles of the moon and sun, as is the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, the Coligny calendar considers the phases of the moon to be important, and each month always begins with the same moon phase. The calendar uses a mathematical arrangement to keep a normal 12-month calendar in sync with the moon and keeps the whole system in sync by adding an [[intercalary month]] every 2{{frac|1|2}} years. The Coligny calendar registers a five-year cycle of 62 [[lunar month]]s, divided into a "bright" and a "dark" fortnight (or half a moon cycle) each. The months were possibly taken to begin on the new moon, and a 13th [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month was added every two and a half years to align the lunations with the solar year.

The astronomical format of the calendar year that the Coligny calendar represents may well be far older, as [[calendar]]s are usually even more conservative than rites and [[cult (religion)|cult]]s. The date of its inception is unknown, but correspondences of [[Insular Celtic]] and [[Continental Celtic]] calendars suggest that some early form may date to [[Proto-Celtic]] times, roughly 800 BC. The Coligny calendar achieves a complex synchronisation of the solar and lunar months. Whether it does this for philosophical or practical reasons, it points to considerable degree of sophistication.

==Medieval Irish and Welsh calendars==
{{Further|Gaelic calendar|Welsh holidays}}
Among the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celts]], the year was divided into a light half and a dark half. As the day was seen as beginning at sunset, so the year was seen as beginning with the arrival of the darkness, at [[Calan Gaeaf]]/[[Samhain]] (1 November in the modern calendar). The light half of the year started at [[Calan Mai|Calan Haf]]/[[Bealtaine]] (1 May, modern calendar). This observance of festivals beginning the evening before the festival day is still seen in the celebrations and folkloric practices among the [[Gaels]], such as the traditions of ''[[Samhain|Oíche Shamhna]]'' (Samhain Eve) among the Irish and ''Oidhche Shamhna'' among the [[Scottish people|Scots]].&lt;ref name="Danaher"&gt;[[Kevin Danaher|Danaher, Kevin]] (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin: Mercier {{ISBN|1-85635-093-2}}; pp. 200–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;[[F. Marian McNeill|McNeill, F. Marian]] (1961) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. Glasgow: William MacLellan; p. 11-42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] said in his ''[[Gallic Wars]]'': "[the Gaulish Celts] keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night." Longer periods were reckoned in nights, as in the surviving English term fortnight meaning two weeks, and the obsolete se'nnight meaning one week.

The [[Laws of Hywel Dda]]  (in editions surviving from the 12th and 13th centuries)  make repeated references to periods of ''nine days'' (''nawfed dydd''), rather than the "eight nights" that make up the current word ''wythnos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. ''[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/laws_hywel_dda.html Welsh Medieval Laws]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native Calendar terms in the Celtic languages==
Many calendrical and time-keeping terms used in the medieval and modern Celtic languages were borrowed from Latin and reflect the influence of Roman culture and Christianity on the Insular Celts. The words borrowed include the month names ''Januarius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Enáir}}'', Irish ''Eanáir'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Ionawr}}''), ''Februarius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Febra}}'', Irish ''Feabhra'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Chwefror}}''), ''Martius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Mart}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Mawrth}}''), ''Aprilius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Apréil}}'', Irish ''Aibreán'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Ebrill}}''), ''Maius'' (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Mai}}''), ''Augustus'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Auguist}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Awst}}''); the names for the days of the week, ''Solis'', ''Lunae'', ''Martis'', ''Mercurii'', ''Jovis'', ''Veneris'', ''Saturni''; the terms ''septimana'' "week" (Breton ''{{lang|br|sizun}}'', Cornish ''{{lang|kw|seithun}}''), ''kalendae'' "first day of the month" (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|callann}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|calan}}'', Breton ''{{lang|br|kala}}''), ''tempore'' "time" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|tymor}}''), ''matutina'' "morning" (Cornish ''{{lang|kw|metin}}'', Irish ''maidin''), ''vespera'' "evening", ''nona'' "noon" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|nawn}}'', Irish ''nóin''), and ''ôra'' "hour" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|awr}}'', Breton ''{{lang|cy|eur}}'', Irish ''uair'').&lt;ref&gt;Loth, Joseph. Les mots latins dans les langues brittoniques, E. Bouillon, 1892, p. 44 (et al.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of the Irish language]], Royal Irish Academy, 1983. [http://www.dil.ie/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of native Celtic terms survived the adoption of the Roman/Christian calendar, however:

==In Neopaganism==

In some [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religions, a "Celtic calendar" loosely based on that of [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|Medieval Ireland]] is observed for purposes of [[ritual]]. Adherents of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Reconstructionist]] traditions may celebrate the four [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festivals of [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasadh]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, Kensington Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. pp.134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman"&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom''. Alpha Press {{ISBN|0-02-864417-4}}. pp.12, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Some eclectic Neopagans, such as [[Wicca]]ns, combine the Gaelic fire festivals with solstices and equinox celebrations derived from non-Celtic cultures to produce the modern, Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Hutton1"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1991) ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and
Legacy''. Oxford, Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-18946-7}} p.337&lt;/ref&gt; Some eclectic Neopagans are also influenced by [[Robert Graves]]' "Celtic Tree Calendar", which has no foundation in historical calendars or actual ancient [[Early Irish astrology|Celtic Astrology]], instead being derived from Graves' vision of the Song of Amergin.&lt;ref name="Hutton2"&gt;Hutton (1991) pp.145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clement Scott.png|250px|thumb|right|Clement Scott, from a copy of the ''Theatre'' magazine, aged about 40]]

'''Clement William Scott''' (6 October 1841 – 25 June 1904) was an influential English theatre critic for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and other journals, and a playwright, lyricist, translator and travel writer, in the final decades of the 19th century.  His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.

Scott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and others.  After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.

==Life and career==
Born the son of [[William Scott (Vicar of St Olave's, Jewry)|William Scott]], the perpetual curate of [[Hoxton]] in north London, Scott converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] before his 21st birthday. Educated at [[Marlborough College]], he became a civil servant, working in the [[War Office]] beginning in 1860.&lt;ref name=Burner&gt;Burner, Alma J. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3493 "A Chapter of the London Stage: The Clement Scott Papers"], Vol. XXVII, Winter 1973–1974, No. 2, University of Rochester Library Bulletin, University of Rochester, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Emeljanow, Victor. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101035982/ "Scott, Clement William (1841–1904)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Encouraged to write by the humorist [[Tom Hood]] the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', ''Weekly Dispatch'', and to Hood's own paper, ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', where Scott and [[W. S. Gilbert]] were colleagues.  Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed ''Victoria Review''.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

He became the dramatic writer for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre.  In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. He also contributed regularly to ''The Theatre'', a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including "[[Oh Promise Me]]"), which were often published in the magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' by his friend, the editor, [[F. C. Burnand]].  Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

As well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including ''The Vicarage'', ''The Cape Mail'', ''Anne Mié'', ''Odette'', and ''The Great Divorce Case''.  He wrote several English adaptations of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, some of which were written in collaboration with [[B. C. Stephenson]], such as ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878, as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operetta ''Le Petit Duc'' (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]]) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, "Bolton Rowe", another Mayfair street.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]], the producers of [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]]'s plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the [[British Isles]] and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the "Swiss Cradle Song", later adapted as "[[Now Is the Hour (song)|Now Is the Hour]]"&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/206.htm "A 206th Garland of British Composers], June 2001, MusicWeb International, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Haere Ra", the [[Māori people|Māori]] farewell song, which white New Zealanders "mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779550,00.html "Music: Now Is the Hour"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 19 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for the hymn "Search Me, O God", with lyrics by [[J. Edwin Orr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hymntime.com/tch/htm/s/e/searchme.htm &amp;ldquo;Search Me, O God&amp;rdquo;] at the ''Cyber Hymnal''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Australian family has long claimed that the "Clement Scott" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Terry.

===''Poppyland'' and later years===
In 1883, the ''Daily Telegraph'' printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north [[Norfolk]] coast. He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name ''[[Poppyland]]''.  His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area.  Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_louiejermy.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Louie Jeremy"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_gardenofsleep.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Garden of Sleep"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clement Scott.JPG|thumb|right|Clement Scott memorial at [[Cromer]], Norfolk]]
Scott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of [[George du Maurier]], and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco.  Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the [[Garrick Club]] (to which [[Henry Irving]], Gilbert and [[Arthur Sullivan]], among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in ''Great Thoughts'', Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to [[Biarritz]] to write ''The Drama of Yesterday and Today''.  He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the ''[[New York Herald]]'', later returning to London.  In 1900, he founded ''The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal'', for writers who worked by the job, which he edited.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Scott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in [[Woburn Square]] at the age of 62.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1904/06/26/archives/death-of-clement-scott-once-powerful-theatrical-critic-expires-in.html "Death of Clement Scott"], ''The New York Times'', 26 June 1904, p. 7 (subscription required); and "A Dramatic End", ''London Evening News'', 25 June 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style, controversies and influence==
[[File:Mr Clement Scott Plays on One String Now.png|thumb|upright|left|Scott playing the ''Daily Telegraph'' violin (1897)]]
Scott's position on the ''Daily Telegraph'' and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, ''The Theatre'', achieved wide circulation.  He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], the chief English supporter of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], tended to involve him often in controversies.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

Scott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews.  It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines.  Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet.&lt;ref name=Gillan1&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-critic.html "The Fall of Clement Scott"], StageBeauty.net, 2007, accessed 13 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays.

[[Image:Constable Clement Scott.png|thumb|upright|Scott in the ''Entr'acte'' in 1898, when he accused Ibsen and Shaw of being harmful to society]]
Early in his career, he wrote approvingly of the "cup and saucer" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings.  Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging.  As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses.  His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

Scott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly ''Great Thoughts'' in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their "compliance". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the ''Daily Telegraph'' was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

His papers are located in the library of [[Rochester University]], New York State.  Film maker [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] (''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''Mrs. Brown'', ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'') made his first feature film for the BBC, ''Poppyland'' (1985), around the story of Scott's visit to Poppyland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">The '''Compagnie des arts de Paris''' was a military unit of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. It was formed on 6 September 1792 in the Louvre [[Revolutionary sections of Paris|section]] and was made up of students of Letters and Sciences, particularly from the école de Droit and écoles des Beaux-Arts. It paraded before the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] on 8 September 1792 and was incorporated on 23 September 1792 into the Bataillon 9 bis, then at [[Châlons-en-Champagne]] and known as the Bataillon de l'arsenal or Arsenal battalion. It was disbanded at the end of February 1793.

Its volunteers included its captain Jacques Lemercier (sculptor), sous-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Francesqui (sculptor known as Fransechi-Delorme),  sous-officier [[Louis-François Lejeune]] (painter), private [[Jacques Augustin Catherine Pajou]] (painter) and the future economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].

'''Conceptual Design''' is an early phase of the design process, in which the broad outlines of function and form of something are articulated. It includes the design of interactions, experiences, processes and strategies. It involves an understanding of people's needs - and how to meet them with products, services, &amp; processes. Common artifacts of conceptual design are concept sketches and models.

'''Dominique Antoine Jean-Baptiste Magaud''' (4 August 1817, [[Marseille]] - 23 December 1899, Marseille) was a French painter, [[muralist]] and art school director.

== Biography ==
He came from a middle-class family and began his career as a customs weigher for the [[Old Port of Marseilles]]. In 1839, he decided to start new career and enrolled at the local art academy. After graduating, he completed his studies with [[Léon Cogniet]] at the [[École des Beaux-arts]] in Paris and remained there for a few years.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Antoine-Dominique_Magaud Brief biography] from the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] by Gaston Sortais @ WikiSource.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magaud-Law.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The Law, Between Force and Justice]]
When he returned to Marseille, he became a decorative painter, specializing in cafés. In 1853, his paintings of [[Amphitrite]] and [[Bacchus]], on the ceiling at the "Café des Milles-Colonnes" (named after a famous establishment in Paris) secured his reputation. In 1858, he painted an [[allegorical]] scene of Marseille receiving the world's products at the "Café des Deux Mondes" and, in 1860, [[Cybele]] in a chariot pulled by lions, at the Grand Hôtel. All of this work has since disappeared.

During his work on these commercial enterprises, the [[Jesuits]] commissioned him to decorate the large meeting room at their Religious Association; a building originally occupied by the congregation of [[Saint Vincent de Paul]], dating from 1643. It had recently been enlarged and remodeled under the direction of Marseille's Chief Architect, [[Pascal Coste]]. Magaud worked on this project from 1856 to 1864 and created fifteen murals that portrayed the contributions  Catholicism had made to civilization. Among these were a scene of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landing at [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]] and one of [[Alessandro Volta]] contemplating God while in his laboratory.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; They were arranged around a large canvas, mounted on the ceiling, depicting the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] in heaven, surrounded by angels, which is now gone.
[[File:Apotheosis of the great men of Provence-IMG 5978.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Study (art)|Study]] for the Apotheosis of the Great Men of Provence. The full mural was destroyed in 1944]]
Following this, he received a major commission from the Prefect, [[Charlemagne de Maupas]], to decorate the new headquarters building for the Prefecture of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], which was still under construction. From 1865 to 1873, he created eight ceilings with allegorical subjects and thirty-two miscellaneous murals in the offices.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;[http://visite.marseille.fr/mairie/autoportrait_de_dominique_antoine_magaud.php Biographical notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172528/http://visite.marseille.fr/mairie/autoportrait_de_dominique_antoine_magaud.php |date=2015-09-23 }} @ Visite Marseille.&lt;/ref&gt; While engaged in this massive project, the Chamber of Commerce enlisted him to take over the work of painting the ceiling in the [[Exchange (organized market)|Bourse]]. This painting, "L'Apothéose des grands hommes de Provence", was destroyed by a bombing in 1944.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; 

In 1866, he was named a member of the [[Académie de Marseille]] and, three years later, was appointed Director of his old alma mater, the "École des Beaux-Arts de Marseille".&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; After completing work at the Bourse, he devoted himself almost entirely to the school. During his twenty-seven year tenure, the number of professors increased from three to eighteen. Two painters and five sculptors who had studied there won the [[Prix de Rome]]. In 1886, he became a Knight of the [[Légion d'Honneur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=COTE&amp;VALUE_1=LH%2F1684%2F17 Dossier] @ the Base Léonore&lt;/ref&gt; Just two years before his retirement, in 1894, he decorated the school's ballroom.

== Critical reception ==
* Daniel Dercksen from The Writing Studio awarded Fanie Fourie's Lobola a rating of 5/5 in his review. Daniel sums the film up in the following brief conclusion [taken directly from his review written on the web]: "It is one of this films you can share with others who might not see the world you do, and at the end of the screening it is guaranteed that you will have made new friends. Fanie Fourie's Lobola is a film that everyone can enjoy with its English subtitles and message that transcends our borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page4513.html |title=Page Title |publisher=Writingstudio.co.za |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425030432/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page4513.html |archivedate=25 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nontsikelelo Mpulo from The Drum had the following brief conclusion in her review: "The film does not shy away from dealing with the racial prejudices that still thrive in South African society.  Fanie is a stereotypical boere seun who knows very little about Zulu culture and so he blunders into situations that have the potential to create serious offence but the script is so well written that you’ll find yourself laughing out loud at some of his ludicrous antics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=phakamani |url=http://drum.co.za/entertainment/movie-review-fanie-fouries-lobola/ |title=Movie review: Fanie Fourie’s lobola |publisher=DRUM |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The website SPLING awarded the film a 7/10 in their review that came to the conclusion: "Fanie Fourie's Lobola is a crowd-pleaser - a romantic comedy that's fresh, entertaining, heartwarming, street smart and sweet. It's bold to tackle an interracial romance, it's bolder to turn it into a comedy. Henk Pretorius and his team have really turned Nape 'A Motana's story into a fun-loving and well-balanced feature film that proudly showcases our music, our diversity and our people. The bottom line: Charming"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spling.co.za/movie-reviews/card/fanie-fouries-lobola |title=Movie Critic &amp;#124; Movie Reviews &amp;#124; Film News &amp;#124; Celeb Interviews - Fanie Fourie's Lobola &amp;#124; Romance |publisher=SPLING |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reney Warrington from Litnet came to the following conclusion in her review: "FFL pokes fun at our cultural differences, and at how little we know about the different cultures in our country, but it does so with respect, without an accusatory tone. 10 out of 10 just for that! It goes beyond poking fun. It asks questions around racism, patriarchy and sexism and even goes so far as to suggest we should give the younger generation some room to start their own traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litnet.co.za/Article/fanie-fouries-lobola-is-an-awesome-south-african-flick |title=Fanie Fourie’s Lobola is an awesome South African flick - Reney Warrington |publisher=LitNet |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glory''''' is a 1989 American [[war film]] directed by [[Edward Zwick]], starring [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Cary Elwes]] and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The screenplay by [[Kevin Jarre]] was based on the books ''Lay This Laurel'' by Lincoln Kirstein and ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' by [[Peter Burchard]], and the personal letters of Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]].  The end credits are superimposed on photos of the monument to the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] on [[Boston Common]].

The film is about one of the first military units of the [[Union Army]], during the [[American Civil War]], to consist entirely of African-American men (except for its officers), as told from the point of view of Colonel Shaw, its white commanding officer. The regiment is known especially for its heroic actions at [[Fort Wagner]].

''Glory'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]] and won three, including one for Denzel Washington for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Private Silas Tripp. It won many other awards from, among others, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, the [[Political Film Society]], and the [[NAACP Image Awards]].

The film was co-produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Freddie Fields|Freddie Fields Productions]], and distributed by Tri-Star Pictures in the United States. It premiered in limited release in the United States on December 14, 1989, and in wide release on February 16, 1990, making $26.8 million on an $18 million budget. The soundtrack, composed by [[James Horner]] and performed in part by [[Boys Choir of Harlem]], was released on January 23, 1990. The home video was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. On June 2, 2009, a widescreen [[Blu-ray]] version, featuring the director's commentary and deleted scenes, was released.

==Plot==
During the American Civil War, [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Robert Gould Shaw|Robert Shaw]], injured at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], is sent home to Boston on [[medical leave]]. Shaw accepts a promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] commanding the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. He asks his friend, Cabot Forbes, to serve as his second in command, with the rank of major. Their first volunteer is another friend, Thomas Searles, a bookish, free [[African American|African-American]]. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Silas Tripp, and a [[muteness|mute]] teenage drummer boy.

The men learn that, in response to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be [[summarily executed|executed]] as well as their white officers. They are offered, but turn down, a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training with Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, which Shaw realizes is to prepare them for the challenges they will face.

Tripp goes [[AWOL]] and is caught; Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops. He then learns that Tripp left to find shoes to replace his worn ones because his men are being denied supplies. He confronts the base's racist [[quartermaster]] on their behalf. Shaw also supports them in a pay dispute, as the [[U.S. Government|Federal government]] pays black soldiers $10, not the $13 per month white soldiers earn. When the men begin tearing up their pay stubs in protest of the unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own pay stub in support of their actions. In recognition of his leadership, Shaw promotes Rawlins to the rank of Sergeant-Major.

Once the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General [[Charles Garrison Harker|Charles Harker]]. On the way to South Carolina they are ordered by Colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] to sack and burn [[Darien, Georgia]]. Shaw initially refuses to [[Superior orders|obey an unlawful order]], but agrees under threat of having his troops taken away. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight, as their duties to date have involved mostly manual labor, for which they are mocked. Shaw finally gets the 54th into combat after he confronts Harker and threatens to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In their first battle at [[Battle of Grimball's Landing|James Island, South Carolina]], the 54th successfully defeats a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Tripp. Shaw offers Tripp the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, not believing the war will result in a better life for slaves.

General George Strong informs Shaw of [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|a major campaign]] to secure a foothold at [[Charleston Harbor]]. This involves assaulting [[Morris Island]] and capturing [[Fort Wagner]], whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches to inspire others. On their way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.

The 54th leads the charge on the fort, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the walls of the fort. Attempting to encourage his men, Shaw is killed. Tripp lifts the flag, rallying the soldiers to continue, but he too is soon shot dead. Forbes takes charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's defenses. On the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two Color Sergeants are fired upon by Confederate artillery. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with bodies of Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass grave, with Shaw and Tripp's bodies next to each other.

Closing text reveals Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army. However, the courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the Union accepting thousands of black men for combat, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.

==Production==
[[File:St_GaudensShaw_Mem.jpg|thumb|Memorial at Boston Common by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]]]
Kevin Jarre's inspiration for writing the film came from viewing [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial|the monument to Colonel Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] in [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;  The [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th]] was the first formal unit of the [[U.S. Army]] to be made up entirely of African-American enlisted men; all of the officers were white men.  His screenplay was based on two books, Lincoln Kirstein's ''Lay This Laurel'' (1973) and [[Peter Burchard]]'s ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' (1965), and the personal letters of [[Robert Gould Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent (December 14, 1989). [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE4D8113FF937A25751C1A96F948260 Glory (1989)]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior filming took place primarily in Massachusetts and Georgia. Opening passages, meant to portray the Battle of Antietam, show volunteer military [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]] filmed at a major engagement at the [[Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District|Gettysburg]] battlefield. Zwick did not want to turn ''Glory'' "into a black story with a more commercially convenient white hero".&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194041&amp;rss=mrqe |title=Glory (1989) |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Morgan Freeman noted: "We didn't want this film to fall under that shadow. This is a picture about the 54th Regiment, not Colonel Shaw, but at the same time the two are inseparable."&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; Zwick hired the writer [[Shelby Foote]] as a technical adviser; he later became widely known for his contributions to [[Ken Burns]]' PBS nine-episode documentary, ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

The film contains numerous inaccuracies. The movie implies that most of the soldiers in the regiment were former slaves, when in fact a majority had been born free in the North. The regiment was not formed until early 1863, so they were not in camp for Christmas of 1862, and on the day the recruits arrived at Readville, they were given uniforms and new boots so soldiers were not reduced to marching barefoot in cold mud, as the film depicts. While the film shows Shaw volunteering his unit immediately after hearing General Strong describe Fort Wagner's defenses, the regimental commanders had conferred among themselves before going back to Strong and telling him that the 54th was to make the charge. Another inaccuracy is in showing the 54th attacking the fort from north to south with the ocean on their left.  The actual attack occurred from the opposite direction, with the ocean on the right parallel to the regiment. Despite the film's closing statement that Wagner was never taken by U.S. forces, it fell to Union hands in September 1863 after further shelling from the U.S. Navy.

''Glory'' was the first major motion picture to tell the story of black U.S. soldiers fighting for their freedom from slavery during the Civil War.  The 1965 [[James Stewart]] film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' also depicted black soldiers fighting for the Union, but the script suggested the Union army at that time was integrated.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic [[Vincent Canby]]'s review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "[Broderick] gives his most mature and controlled performance to date....[Washington is] an actor clearly on his way to a major screen career...The movie unfolds in a succession of often brilliantly realized vignettes tracing the 54th's organization, training and first experiences below the [[Mason-Dixon line]]. The characters' idiosyncrasies emerge."&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "a strong and valuable film no matter whose eyes it is seen through".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; He believed the production design credited to Norman Garwood and the cinematography of Freddie Francis paid "enormous attention to period detail".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |Watching ''"Glory,"'' I had one reccuring [''sic''] problem. I didn't understand why it had to be told so often from the point of view of the 54th's white commanding officer. Why did we see the black troops through his eyes — instead of seeing him through theirs? To put it another way, why does the top billing in this movie go to a white actor?

The film was not without its detractors. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was not impressed at all with the overall acting, calling Broderick "catastrophically miscast as Shaw".&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter (December 1989). Glory (1989). ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the picture by saying, "the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth".&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard (December 5, 1989).

Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', pointed out some flaws that included mentioning Broderick as "an amiable non-presence, creating unintentionally the notion that the 54th earned their stripes despite wimpy leadership".&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;Desson, Howe (January 12, 1990).

[[James Berardinelli]] writing for ''[[ReelViews]]'', called the film "without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War," and noted that it "has important things to say, yet it does so without becoming pedantic".&lt;ref name="reelview"&gt;Berardinelli, James (December 1989).

[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film a ''thumbs up'' review, saying, "like ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', this is another admirable film that turns out to be surprisingly entertaining". He thought the film took on "some true social significance" and felt the actors portrayed the characters as "more than simply black men". He explained: "They're so different, that they become not merely standard Hollywood blacks, but true individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Siskel, Gene (December 1989).

'''''He's Just Not That Into You''''' is a [[self-improvement]] book written by [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]] that was published in 2004 and later adapted into a film by the [[He's Just Not That Into You (film)|same name]] in 2009. It was a [[New York Times bestseller]] and was featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

== Background ==
The book was inspired by an episode of ''[[Sex and the City]],'' "Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little", in which [[Miranda Hobbes]] asks [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s boyfriend, [[Jack Berger]], to analyze the post-date behavior of a potential love interest. Because the man declined Miranda's invitation to come up to her apartment after the date, stating that he has an early meeting, Berger concludes, "He's just not that into you", adding, "When a guy's really into you, he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting." The book authors, [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]], were writers on the show.

==Synopsis==
The book is a "self-help" guide aimed for single women. The premise of the book, as stated in the title, tells women readers that if a man in whom you are interested is not making the effort to pursue you, he is simply "just not that into you."

== Film ==
{{main|He's Just Not That Into You (film)}}

A film based on the book was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on February 6, 2009. Produced by [[Flower Films]] (Drew Barrymore's production company), filming was completed at the end of 2007. The film was released in theaters February 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=2119539&amp;mp=syn |title=He's Just Not That Into You (2009) - Synopsis&amp;nbsp;— MSN Movies |publisher=Entertainment.msn.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Kwapis]] directed the film, which featured an all-star cast including [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Justin Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/fullcredits#cast|title=IMDB for He's Just Not That Into You}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $180 million worldwide.

== In popular culture ==

The book appears in ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode "Pulp Friction", when [[Lorelai Gilmore]] prepares the Dragon Fly Inn's library for her interview and states that all of the good books are gone, leaving her with five copies of ''He's Just Not That Into You'', which she hands an employee to dispose of. The book was also referenced in the movie ''[[Zombieland]]'', in season two of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'' and in TV series "[[Vexed]]".

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==
{{See also|Pasigraphy}}

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society of Caricature Artists''' (previously known as the '''National Caricaturist Network''') is an international non-profit trade association founded in 1989. Its purpose is to promote the art of [[caricature]], educate the public and the media about the art of caricature and to provide its members with helpful information about caricature as an art form as well as a profession.  The ISCA  currently {{when|date=June 2018}} has close to 500 members from around the world. Members receive the quarterly magazine, Exaggerated Features, which has articles about caricaturing, featured artists tips and stories as well as other useful information about caricature illustration. The ISCA annual convention is held each year in a different location. The conventions features a guest speaker, lectures, seminars, competitions, awards and the camaraderie of your peers in the art of caricature drawing.

The quarterly newsletter, Exaggerated Features, is sent to the members and an annual convention is held for socialization as well as education and competition.

==History==
The NCN was formed by Wallace "Buddy" Rose. Buddy created a forum for caricaturists by providing a quarterly newsletter and annual convention. The original goal was to create an organization that would seek out charitable and mutual benefits for united artists. It operated briefly as a booking agency until filing its application in compliance with article 5154a making it a trade union in 1994. In 1995 the new constitution was ratified in San Antonio, TX, the NCN was granted non-profit status, and the first election was held. In 2005, the NCN was changed into a non-profit, unincorporated association.

The association boasts some of the most recognizable names in the industry as members and friends of the NCN. [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], [[Sergio Aragones]], [[Mort Drucker]] and [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)]] of Mad Magazine, [[Jan Op De Beeck]], Maria Bolton, Sam Norkin, Rudy Cristiano, Bruce Blitz, C.F. Payne, Pancho Willmarth, Mike Peters, Steve Silver and [[Sebastian Krüger]] have all been keynote speakers and members. Many NCN members are accomplished as artists not only in caricaturing, but in other artistic fields as well.

The NCN officially changed its name to the International Society of Caricature Artists in 2009 to better reflect its international growth and presence. As of 2010 it has over 600 members worldwide. In recent years the International Society of Caricature Artists annual convention has featured guests of honor such as Sam Viviano, Dan Adel, Tom Richmond, Hermann Mejia, Mark Fredrickson and Bill Plympton. In 2011, ISCA will celebrate its 20th anniversary.

'''''Kid Notorious''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] that aired from October 22 to December 17, 2003 on [[Comedy Central]]. It starred [[Hollywood]] film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] as himself. Episode plots were often bizarre and [[absurdism|absurdist]] in nature, featuring Evans as a [[James Bond]] type character. [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] also appeared on the show as himself. The show was directed by [[Pete Michels]].

==Characters==
* [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert "Kid Notorious" Evans (himself)]], a playboy Hollywood producer who finds himself mixed up in bizarre and absurd situations but never loses his cool.
* Tollie Mae ([[Niecy Nash]]), Evans's loud and obese maid. Spends most of her time binge eating chocolate and lusting after [[Denzel Washington]]. Her catchphrase is "Not in my job description." Tollie Mae was named for Tollie Mae Wilson, who was Evans's housekeeper at the time of his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]].
* [[Alan Selka|Alan "English" Selka (himself)]], Evans's long suffering butler. A running gag involves Puss Puss farting into his face. Voiced by Evans's real life butler, Alan Selka, who is reportedly very much like his character in real life.
* Puss Puss, Evans's beloved cat, who follows him wherever he goes; she plays chess and smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Puss has a hate-hate relationship with English which has included pistol-whipping, neck crushing, releasing flatulence into face and placing piranha in the sauna.
* [[Slash (musician)|Saul "Slash" Hudson (himself)]], the former lead guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]]. As in real life, Slash is Evans's close friend and next-door neighbor.
* [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ([[Billy West]]), the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] at the time. He is depicted as a sidekick and poker buddy of Evans and Slash.

The '''Klondike Big Inch Land''' promotion was a  [[marketing]] promotion run by the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 1955 and created by Bruce Baker, a Chicago advertising executive.

== Inception ==
Quaker Oats bought 19.11 acres of land in the [[Yukon Territory]] of [[Canada]] for the price of $1000 USD and printed up 21 million deeds for one square inch of land.  On advice of counsel, Quaker Oats set up and transferred the land to the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company to make the company the registered owner and manager of the deeds.

Starting on January 1955, 93 newspapers across the United States ran advertisements that read "Get a real deed to one square inch of land in the Yukon gold rush country" and, "You'll actually own one square inch of Yukon land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Folks still make claims in Sgt. Preston's Yukon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860920&amp;id=tlkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1066,5068721|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=1986-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion was tied to the ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' radio show which Quaker Oats was sponsoring at the time.

== Obtaining Deeds ==
The promotion instructed people to mail a form along with a box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company.  In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch of land in the Klondike was sent back.  In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the deed for a box top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the "sale" of foreign land.&lt;ref name="Akron Beacon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Mark J.|title=Local history: Quaker Oats prize creates Yukon land rush in 1955|url=http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/history/local-history-quaker-oats-prize-creates-yukon-land-rush-in-1955-1.257639|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal Online|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the deeds in each box of cereal produced.

Since none of the deeds were actually registered, the documents were never legally binding and owners of these deeds were never actual owners of any land.  The deed excluded mineral rights on the property.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats" /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

== Afterwards ==
Due to $37.20 in back taxes, the land was repossessed by the Canadian government in 1965, and the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company dissolved in 1966.  The land is now part of the [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] Golf Course.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats"&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Vincent|title=1955 Quaker Oats Yukon Land Giveaway: Deeds on "eBay"|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217032350/http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

To this day, Yukon officials receive letters and phone calls about the deeds. The land office of the Yukon currently contains an 18-inch thick file folder of correspondence regarding the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Klondike Big Inch|url=http://www.yukoninfo.com/klondikebiginch.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the [[sword]] (Korean ''geom'' 검; 劍) in the [[Korean Peninsula]] begins with imports via [[Bronze Age]] in the mid 1st millennium BCE.
Native production of Bronze and Iron swords appears to pick up beginning in the mid 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name=Royal&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmHjMgEACAAJ|title=Korean Weapons &amp; Armor|journal=Transactions of the Korea Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=23 Part 2|first=John L. |last=Boots|year=1934|pages=1–37}} (Full text of Microsoft Word format is available [http://www.raskb.com/transactions/VOL23Part2/VOL023Part2-1.docx here])&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea had its separate sword industry and a native tradition of [[Korean swordsmanship]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]
(15th to 19th centuries). 
This tradition was eclipsed by the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] (1910-1945).
Since the later 20th century, there have been efforts towards reviving the lost arts of Korean sword-making and swordsmanship.
 
Elements of the '''Korean sword''' include: ''geomjip'' or scabbard, most often of lacquer; ''hyuljo'' or fuller (most genuine Korean swords didn't have a fuller); ''hwando magi'' or collar; ''ho in'' or collar; ''kodeungi'' or hand guard; a ring-design pommel; tassels; a round and wide designed sword guard, or a straight lotus design.&lt;ref name="무기와 방어구 편"&gt;한국환상사전.

== History ==

===Early swords===
{{further|Hwandudaedo}}
[[File:three kingdom swords.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era swords generally have a ring [[hilt|pommel]].  More elaborate swords hold images of dragons or phoenixes in the ring.]]
[[File:SillaSwordHilt.jpg|thumb|[[Silla]] era sword pommel]]
[[File:Ornamented Sword from Gyerim-ro, Gyeongju.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ornamented Sword made during the Silla period]]

There is evidence of early imports of [[Chinese Bronze Age]] swords to the Korean peninsula.
Evidence of sword production dates to the transitional Late Bronze to Early Iron Age (c. 1st century BC), with an 
earthenware mold for a Bronze Sword found in [[South Gyeongsang Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?langCodeCon=LC2&amp;menuID=002004001&amp;relicID=7315&amp;relicDetailID=29287 |title=Korean National Museum Accession Number   Bongwan 14050 |access-date=2014-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111035632/http://www.museum.go.kr/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?langCodeCon=LC2&amp;menuID=002004001&amp;relicID=7315&amp;relicDetailID=29287 |archive-date=2016-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Korean sword type is the so-called [[Hwandudaedo]] or "ring-pommel sword", prevalent during the 1st to 6th centuries. Until the 3rd century, these sword were very rare and presumably reserved for royalty. They became more attainable in the later 4th and during the 5th century, and are found in many higher class tombs of this period. Their production declined in the 6th century.

By the last third of the Three Kingdoms period (i.e. 450 AD and beyond), steel making techniques had come from China (possibly during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period in China) and were also employed in Korean swordmaking by all three Korean kingdoms ([[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2013, a Chinese Character inscription was discovered on a 5th-century sword  from the  [[Geumgwanchong]] tomb in [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].
The  scabbard of the sword has the inscription  尒斯智王 ''Yisaji-wang'' ("King Isaji").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/03/317_138624.html Sword sparks debate], The Korean Times, 4 July 2013. [http://www.museum.go.kr/site/program/board/galleryboard/view?boardtypeid=36&amp;menuid=001007010004&amp;boardid=18821 Discovery of the Silla Geumgwanchong Tomb "King Isaji" Sword Inscription] (museum.go.kr) 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long swords during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korean Three Kingdoms period]] were used primarily by cavalry and commanders (who were also usually mounted), not infantry. At this time land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers on horseback using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with twin blades. Swords were not a primary weapon for all combat but were instead used mostly for shock attacks, defensive strokes, and for close-in fighting. Blades were heavy as they were made mostly of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances or for very close-in work. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely.

Records indicate that the art of sword manufacturing, still in a rudimentary state, may have been transmitted to the Japanese Archipelago from the Korean Peninsula some time in the Three Kingdoms period, along with iron smelting and manufacture and later that of steel work; these methods and techniques, as well as their updates, continued to be transmitted during the [[North South States Period]] to the Japanese Archipelago until connections with the Asian mainland were largely closed off by Japan in the early part of the [[Heian period]] (794 AD to 1195 AD; the early part is considered to have ended in 967 AD).

During the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, a limited number of Korean swords were exported for trade missions in Asia. It is likely that Korean swordmaking was influenced by the various influences present in Mongol and Chinese weapon manufacture after Goryeo's submission as a Mongol vassal after [[Mongol invasions of Korea|6 Mongol invasions]] ending in 1259.

===Joseon period ===
[[File:Hyewon-Ssanggeum.daemu-detail-01.jpg|thumb|Painting of a [[kisaeng]] performing a sword dance ([[Hyewon]], 1805)]]
The [[Joseon period]] (15th to 19th centuries) is the "classical" era of Korean culture, including the creation of a [[Hangul|national script]] and the suppression of [[Korean Buddhism]] in favour of [[Neo-Confucianism]].
Korean swords were in production both for military and ceremonial use. Several types of ceremonial swords were made; among these sword types are the jingeom (dragon sword) and ingeom (tiger sword), which by tradition could be forged only at certain times. The highest grade of these, sa-ingeom (four tigers sword) and possibly the sa-jingeom (four dragons sword - none are extant) were reserved for the monarch and could only be made during a window of 2 hours every 12 years. The lower-grade swords - i-jingeom, sam-jingeom, i-ingeom, sam-ingeom (two dragons, three dragons, two tigers, three tigers) - could be made more frequently.

The swords that Joseon soldiers used were crafted with the greatest care, using only high quality steel considered for the use of military swords. Some of the swords that were used uniformly by these soldiers include the [[jedok geom]]  and [[bonguk geom]]. The three types of blades listed here are single edged and usually between 3–4 feet long, although the jedok geom could reach a length of 6 feet.

It was not uncommon for non-military sword carriers to import swords, frequently from Japan's renowned swordsmiths, in the event that Korean sources could not be secured (as they were frequently dedicated to the production of weapons for military use).

The ''saingeom'' is a type of Joseon-era [[sword]] from Western Korea fairly common in the Ai-Ching province. It has a 90 centimeter (35&amp;nbsp;inch) blade, produced primarily by molding rather than hammering.

===Modern history===
Korean swords are very scarce today, since most surviving examples were confiscated and destroyed during the colonial period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} A systematic attempt was made to collect and destroy all Korean swords, coats of armour, and all Korean martial arts equipment.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The entire history of Korean swords and armour was almost lost forever, along with much of Korea's culture and traditions, because of Japanese colonial policies.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Wontack 1994 Paekchae of Korea and the origin of Yamato Japan, Seoul Kadura International&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="Coval 1984"&gt;Coval, Dr John Carter and Alan, 1984, "Korean impact on Japanese culture: Japan's hidden History" Hollym International Corp., Elizabeth, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}

After the liberation of Korea in 1945, ceremonial swords were once again manufactured both in southern and northern Korea, and by the 1960s, sword-making was a vibrant and increasingly secure industry; however, due to the depredations and systematic destruction by the Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], many traditions and techniques lost and were either completely unrecoverable or had yet to be recovered.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Types ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Elements of the Korean sword include: ''geomjip'' or scabbard, most often of lacquer; ''hyuljo'' or fuller (most genuine Korean swords didn't have a fuller); ''hwando magi'' or collar; ''ho in'' or collar; ''kodeungi'' or hand guard; a ring-design pommel; tassels; a round and wide designed sword guard, or a straight lotus design.&lt;ref name="무기와 방어구 편"/&gt;

''Geom'' (검; 劍) is the Korean word for "sword"; it is typically used of double edged swords, but is also applied to single edged swords. ''Yedo'' (예도; 銳刀) is the specific term for a single-edged sword.
The [[Muyesinbo]] describes as [[bonguk geom]] or "national sword" a double-edged sword closely resembling the [[Eastern Han]] period ''[[jian]]''. This contrasted with the ''[[jedok geom]]'' or "admiral sword", the term for the type introduced in the 16th century by [[Li Rusong]], usually about 5–6 feet tall and single edged. The sword was also straight and wielded with one or two hands.

The [[Hwandudaedo]] (환두대도; 環頭大刀) or "ring-pommel sword) is a type of single edged sword used during the three kingdoms area. It is known for having a ring pommel and being single or double edged. Most swords during this time was semi-uniform in nature and many martial arts practitioners tend to recognize this weapon as a "Genuine Korean Sword". The Hwandudaedo may have some connection to the Japanese straight swords (tsurugi) and the Chinese Jian.
 
In deference to the [[Neo-Confucianism in Korea|Neo-Confucian]] state philosophy during the [[Joseon period]], Korean swords tended to be somewhat shorter than their Japanese or Chinese templates, with a blunted tip and infrequently having a groove the length of the blade. In this way the sword was made to be represented as being as singularly "unaggressive" as possible.

*''Geom'' is the generic term for "sword", but more specifically also refers to a  shorter straight-blade, double-edged sword with a somewhat blunted tip distinguishes this weapon from its Chinese counterpart, the [[jian]]. As a badge of status rather than a weapon, the Geom was often heavily decorated both on its sheath and grip as well as with engravings and inscriptions on its blade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated141"/&gt;
*The ''To'', commonly referred to as a ''Hwando'' or "military sword", was a single-handed, single-edged sword, in use as the stated sidearm of the Korean soldier well into the 19th century. Sometimes referred to as a "short sword", relative to the out sized two-handed Sangsoodo, its length of 24 to 34 inches  was comparable to that of the two-handed Japanese Katana which may have been the inspiration for the Ssangsoodo. Reports found in the "Book of Corrections", a Korean record of the [[Imjin]] Warum (1592–1598) state that Japanese swords taken in combat were readily pressed into service by simply trimming the length of the hilt. Forged of carbon steel the ''To'' has a single edged, curved blade, a sword guard and a grip, typically of wood. Earlier practice saw the ''To'' suspended from a cord (Jul) and with a simple metal hanger which allowed the soldier to speedily discard his sheath. In later practice, the sword was suspended from a girdle or belt but retained a simple metal quick-release clip.&lt;ref name="autogenerated141"&gt;Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 &amp; PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 2 pg 141&lt;/ref&gt;
*The  ''Ssangsudo'' (쌍수도; 雙手刀)  is a double-handed single-edged sword in use only during a limited time, n the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Chinese literature and history both ascribe its adoption as a weapon on the Asian mainland to General Qi Ji-guang (1628–1687) who is said to have taken pirate prisoners -[[Wokou]]- during his campaigns in Southern China, wrote about the sword in his manual - Lian Bing Shi Ji - and recommended its use as part of the defense along China's northern border. Since General Qi's training manual Jin Xiao Shin Shu was used in the revamping the Korean Military it followed that this weapon came highly recommended. Nor did the Koreans overlook that oversized swords had been used by Japanese soldiers during the recent conflict as well as during their own experiences with the Wakou. Intended by General Qi to be carried into combat on wagons or by individuals who drew each other's weapon, the Ssangsoodo measured an overall length of 6 feet, two feet of which were to be the grip and another 2 feet forward of the handle to be sheathed in brass or copper. Undoubtedly the length and weight of the sword, and the high level of training necessary to wield it, made the sword impractical as a common part of the Korean arsenal. It is also useful to note that the Ming Dynasty, which saw this weapon added to its own military, fell to the Manchu invaders some 50 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 &amp; PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 1, pg 129&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '' Hyup Do'' or  "spear sword") is found in Book Three, Chapter seven. Though commonly taken for a polearm after the fashion of the Japanese Naginata, the text of the Muye Dobo Tong Ji relates that "the handle is about four feet....weighs about four pounds.....the illustration in this book is corrected according to the Mubiji and the Japanese Jang Do. They are the same." It is reasonable to conclude that the Hyup Do was much closer to the Japanese Nagamaki.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 &amp; PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 3, Chap 7, pg 283&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korean Wol-do.jpg|thumb|Korean Wol-Do (L) displayed with its Chinese equivalent (R).]] 
*The *[[Woldo]] (월도; 月刀)   was a bladed polearm, like its Chinese counterpart the Yaoyindao commonly decorated with a tassel or feather affixed to a prominence on the spine of the bladewhich assisted the person wielding the weapon with identifying the blades' center of mass. "the length of the handle is six feet, four inches; the length of the blade is two feet eight inches. The weight is about three pounds, fifteen ounces".&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 &amp; PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 3, Chap 5, pg260&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ssangdo or Ssanggeom (쌍도; 雙刀; 쌍검: 雙劍) This literally means "Twin Swords." It can vary from twin long swords or twin short swords. These techniques can also be used on Horseback as 'Masang ssanggeom'. The Korean cavalry was famous for using Twin Sword techniques on horseback, while balancing on the horse with grace. Ssangyunggeom  are two twin swords that is held with one sheath. The sheath is twice as wide because it needs room for the second sword. The sword's length varies from three to four feet. Usually these swords were double edged and made entirely of Iron (including the sheath).
*[[Hyeopdo]] (협도; 俠刀) This is also a large crescent blade that is similar to the 'Pudao' but wider and thicker. A tassle attached to the end of the blade.
*Janggeom (장검; 長劍): Literally means "long Sword". 
*Hwando (환도): This is a single edged short sword that was strictly used with one hand. This was a common side arm for many soldiers during the Joseon era.
*Unggeom (웅검): This is a single edged long sword that was used with one or two hands. This was another common side arm for many soldiers during the Joseon era.
*Samgakdo (삼각도; 三角刀) The samgakdo, is also a recently used terminology for swords used for mat cutting. The [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of the sword is triangular in shape; hence the name Samgakdo (which means 3 sided sword).
*For martial arts students learning sword forms or ''Geombeop/Geomsul'' practice wood swords or ''mokgeom'' are most often used; then those made out of carbonized bamboo or ''Juk-do''; lastly compression sponge, single or double-edged, with or without blood grooves. Combinations of sword and knife fighting would use plastic blades.
*Chilseonggeom (칠성검; 七星劍) The name of this sword translates as "seven star sword" and it could be either single edged or double  edged but is primarily known for its use by Buddhist practitioners. Almost all of these swords had constellation engravings on the blades (usually the Big Dipper, although depiction of any 7 star cluster isn't uncommon).
*Sainchamsageom: This sword's name literally means 'Great Four Tiger Sword'. This is a ceremonial sword that is used for demon slaying and Shamanistic rituals.&lt;ref name=chosun&gt;Ancient Art of Korea.

They were all made according to the Year, Month, Week, Day, or Hour of the Tiger.&lt;ref name=chosun/&gt; C.f. Samingeom: 'Three Tiger Sword', I-ingeom  'Two Tiger Sword'.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}
*Samjeongdo (삼정도; 三精刀) the sword given to newly promoted Korean military generals each year by the Ministry of National Defense.

The [[Seven-Branched Sword]] is a peculiar specimen forged in Baekjae in the order of the king. There is a theory that this is a sword that was to be a gift presented to the emperor of Japan. There was no handle found for the blade nor was there a swordsheath found for it while it was being excavated.

==Korean swordsmanship==
{{main|Korean swordsmanship}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
During the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period, swords also had ranks depending on who wielded them and what their purpose was. The highest ranking of these swords was known as the  Byeol-ungeom (별운검: 別雲劍), literally meaning "cloud-splitting sword." Only two such swords existed and were wielded by the King's two bodyguards, who always stood on either side of him and held the nobility title of Un'geom (운검: 雲劍). [http://blog.naver.com/medeen44?Redirect=Log&amp;logNo=20029830865]

Master swordsmen
*General [[Kim Yushin]], was said to have been given an engraved sword and sacred books by the gods, and helped to [[Unified Silla|unify Korea]] under [[Silla]]. His most famous son, [[Kim Wonsul]], was a noted swordsman who fought against the [[Tang Dynasty]] armies in the late [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period.
*[[Baek Dong-soo|Baek Dong Soo]] was a swordsman and martial artist who became a folk hero when his group protected [[King Jeongjo]] from assassination attempts. His most notable work, ''[[Muyedobotongji]]'' (illustrated manual of Korean martial arts).

==Contemporary swords==

Only by the mid-1990s did Korean swordmaking come back to expert levels comparable to the Joseon era.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
''Haedong jingeom'' (해동진검; 海東劍) This literally means 'East Asian Practical Sword' is the neologistic term for current-day swords for "revivals" of Korean swordsmanship.

Sword ownership in Korea is currently restricted (private weapons ownership was culturally frowned upon and largely restricted during other times in Korean history, particularly during the Joseon era and the Japanese occupation period - albeit for different reasons in either period), and there are very few traditional sword collectors in Korea today.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} General/flag-grade officers are given dress swords upon assuming command in the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) army. Despite restrictions on sword ownership and a lingering social preference against armed martial arts (dating at least to the Joseon era), practical sword fighting is enjoying a small revival amongst elite military regiments, and fencing is once again attracting interest in Korean universities.

==Authentic reproductions==

In 2006, swords bestowed on newly promoted brigadier generals were changed from the single-edged curved ‘’samjeongdo’’, which was considered to be a traditional Korean sword, to the double-edged straight ‘’samjeong-geom‘’ claiming that the ‘’samjeongdo’’ is similar to the “Western sword” and not reflecting the traditional Korean sword. ‘’Samjeongdo’’ had been given to brigadier generals since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=[브리핑] 삼정도, 삼정검으로 바뀐다 |trans-title=Samjeongdo changed to samjeong-geom |date=May 3, 2006 |publisher=Joins.com |url=http://gangnam.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?total_id=2282105&amp;sc=&amp;mc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=대통령 하사하는 칼, 삼정도서 삼정검으로 |trans-title=A sword bestowed by the president, Samjeongdo to samjeong-geom |date=May 2, 2006 |publisher=Chosun.com |url=http://www.chosun.com/politics/news/200605/200605020147.html |access-date=2017-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107004544/http://www.chosun.com/politics/news/200605/200605020147.html |archive-date=2017-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mindy Alper''' (born 1959) is an American artist who lives in [[Greater Los Angeles]]. Her drawings, paintings, and sculptures focus on the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of people, either in portraiture or as figures who embody aspects of her inner experience. She has been praised for her ability to articulate complex and profound emotion in her work. Among her [[art media]] are paint (oil and acrylic), ink, [[marker pen]], [[papier-mâché]], clay, and wood. She was a [[performance artist]] in the 1980s, and she plays guitar and violin.

Alper is the subject of the documentary film ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'' (2016), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Alper was born into a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-18/entertainment/ca-650_1_mindy-alper/|work=Los Angeles Times |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |authorlink=Kristine McKenna |date=October 18, 1992 |title=Inside the Outsider: Artist Mindy Alper reveals the dark paths of her mind through the compulsiveness of her imaginative drawings |access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/229826/stop-youve-heard-one/ |title=Film Reveals Woman’s Struggles for Her Art |last=Pfefferman |first=Naomi |date=January 17, 2018 |website=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavenisatrafficjamonthe405.com/bio/ |title=Mindy's Bio |website=HeavenIsATrafficJamOnThe405.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Alper had a [[phobia]] of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=3:11}} By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=8:34}}

Alper's parents hired [[visual artist]] Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-mindy-alper-frank-stiefel-oscars-academy-awards-documentary-interview-1202212537/ |title=''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam'' Director on Doc Subject Mindy Alper: 'She’s the most human of us humans' |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=November 20, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud [[nonsense verse]] by [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; She worked with a variety of [[Art media|media]], and introduced Alper to [[papier-mâché]] (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later).{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=9:51}} They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

Alper later attended an [[alternative school]] in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]]. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist [[Harry Burnett]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/01/obituaries/harry-burnett-master-of-puppetry-dies-at-92.html |title=Harry Burnett, Master of Puppetry, Dies at 92 |author=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt; |date=June 1, 1993 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I made really intricate [[marionette]]s that took me months to finish," Alper recalls. "I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them."&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

In 1976, Alper enrolled at [[Immaculate Heart College]], a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1978 she transferred to [[Los Angeles City College]], where she continued her education in art until 1983.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt; In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=21:44}} Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for [[electroconvulsive therapy]], which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:53}}

Through all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mindy-alper/biography |title=Mindy Alper Biography |website=[[Artnet]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorothycannon.com/cannon-bio.htm |title=Dorothy Cannon |last=Hosler |first=Jay |date=May 19, 2014 |orig-year=2007 |website=DorothyCannon.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:15}} Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of [[Occidental College]].&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxy.edu/faculty/susanna-maing |title=Faculty: Susanna Maing |website=Oxy.edu |publisher=[[Occidental College]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also approached Bolivian-American painter Tom Wudl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/tom-wudl |title=Tom Wudl |website=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. "Tom promised me that we are [[creativity]] itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again," Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:48}} Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years.

Among Alper's [[art media]] are [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study [[wood carving]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.documentary.org/online-feature/portrait-artist-heaven-traffic-jam-405 |title=A Portrait of an Artist: ''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Stiefel |interviewer=Akiva Gottlieb |date=February 26, 2018 |website=Documentary.org |publisher=International Documentary Association |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

==Career==
===Teaching===
Alper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/attachment/en/56732acf6aa72cc67a11a515/TextTwoColumnsWithFile/56a2c7307bc1386353e1d7b1 |format=[[DOCX]] |title=Mindy Alper |year=2018 |publisher=[[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s she was a [[teaching assistant]] at Area H Alternative School, one of the first [[alternative school]]s in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Alternative in L.A. Gets Final OK of Board |date=September 1, 1972 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.classmates.com/places/school/Area-H-Alternative-High-School/19933 |via=[[Classmates.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to [[terminally ill]] teenagers at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

It was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, [[Catherine Coulson]] (the "[[Log Lady]]" of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' fame), became one of her students, and also a good friend. "I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected," Coulson explains.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with [[Kristine McKenna]]. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

Susan Arnold, a [[film producer]] and [[casting director]], also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing ''[[Benny &amp; Joon]]'' (1993), she arranged for Alper to help [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a [[mime artist]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/1993/04/23/benny-joon/ |title=''Benny &amp; Joon'' |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |date=April 23, 1993 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

===Exhibitions===
From 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a [[performance art]] and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal ''Fiberarts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Fiberarts |date=July 1984 |last=Saito |first=Shirley |title=Mindy Alper: Sculpting in Papier-Mâché |pages=18–19 |volume=11 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]] in 1988, she returned for a [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo show]] in 1994, called "Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; [[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/5-things-to-know-about-the-amazing-outsider-art-doc-that-just-won-an-oscar-1236194 |title=5 Things to Know About the Inspiring Outsider Art Documentary That Just Won an Oscar |last=Rea |first=Naomi |date=March 5, 2018 |website=Artnet News |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 and 2007 shows demonstrated Alper's drawings in ink and marker pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/exhibitions/mindy-alper/selected-works?view=thumbnails |title=Mindy Alper, September 9 – October 7, 2006 |website=RosamundFelsen.com |publisher=Rosamund Felsen Gallery |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/exhibitions/mindy-alper2/selected-works?view=thumbnails |title=October 13 – November 10, 2007 |website=RosamundFelsen.com |publisher=Rosamund Felsen Gallery |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she exhibited alongside [[abstractionist]] painter Marcia Roberts.

==Content==
Alper's work is [[Representation (arts)|representational]]. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises [[Line art|line drawing]]s and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of [[the unconscious]]. Her figures are human (or [[humanoid]]), and sometimes [[anthropomorphic]]. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had "an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view"; she described Alper's memory as "photographic". Journalist and [[art curator]] [[Kristine McKenna]] esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as "remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity".&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; Writing in 2018, film critic [[Richard Brody]] was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be "brilliant [and] moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/two-standouts-among-the-2018-oscar-nominated-documentary-shorts |title=Two Standouts Among the 2018 Oscar-Nominated Documentary Shorts |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=March 3, 2018 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: "I was very prolific with my drawing," Alper says, "and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate."{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:23}}

==Documentary==
{{main|Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405}}

While studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, [[Frank Stiefel]], was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://nofilmschool.com/2018/03-Commercial%20Exec-Frank-Stiefel-Heaven-Traffic-Jam-405 |title=How a Commercial Exec Became an Oscar-Nominated Director… at 70 |interviewer=Paula Bernstein |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |date=March 1, 2018 |website=No Film School |publisher=NONETWORK |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realscreen.com/2018/03/04/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-on-the-405-takes-oscar-for-best-documentary-short/ |title=''Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' takes Oscar for best documentary short |author=&lt;!-- staff --&gt; |date=March 4, 2018 |website=Realscreen |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2018/02/19/valley-artist-featured-in-oscar-nominated-documentary-ponders-a-trip-to-the-academy-awards/ |title=Valley artist featured in Oscar-nominated documentary ponders a trip to the Academy Awards |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=February 19, 2018 |website=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"/&gt; The film, ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'', premiered at the [[Austin Film Festival]] in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the "Documentary Short" category.

[[File:Kinkakuji 2004-09-21.jpg|thumb|260px|Art of ''Miyabi'' on the [[Muromachi period]]. ([[Kinkaku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]])]]
'''''Miyabi''''' (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]] or [[Wabi-sabi]]. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes to a "sweet loved one".

The ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian period|Heian]] era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.

Adherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the [[Man'yōshū]], the oldest extant collection of [[Japanese poetry]]. The [[Man'yōshū]] contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this.  Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.

Miyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], such as [[Wabi-sabi]], [[Yugen|Yuugen]] and [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]].

The characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel "[[The Tale of Genji]]" by [[Lady Murasaki]] provide  examples of  miyabi.&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese Aesthetics and Culture'' Nancy G. Hume, {{ISBN|978-0791424001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66270">{{Politics}}
The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go To Vietnam" on 1969 album ''Simply the Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/John-Lee-Hooker-Simply-The-Truth/master/417087 |title=John Lee Hooker - Simply The Truth |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]]. Paxton albums such as ''Outward Bound''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/outward-bound-mw0000785860 |title=Outward Bound - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Morning Again''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/morning-again-mw0000786225 |title=Morning Again - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as [[Holly Near]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-in-there-mw0000104473 |title=Hang in There - Holly Near &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Korona]], [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]], [[Utah Phillips]] and more recently [[David Rovics]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the Ewan MacColl tradition of political folk has been continued since the 1960s by singer-songwriters such as [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roy Bailey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-bailey-mn0000343290/biography |title=Roy Bailey &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Rosselson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/21/leon-rosselson-and-the-art-of-radical-songwriting/ |title=Leon Rosselson and the Art of Radical Songwriting |website=Counterpunch.org |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Iain Aitch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/05/folk |title=Iain Aitch meets songwriter Leon Rosselson &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dick Gaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=June Sawyers |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-07-18/news/9507180218_1_love-songs-scottish-folk-music |title=Dick Gaughan Keeps Politics In The Forefront |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1995-07-18 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, a number of artists have blended folk protest with influences from [[punk rock|punk]] and elsewhere to produce topical and political songs for a modern [[independent music|independent rock music]] audience, including [[Billy Bragg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.togetherthepeople.co.uk/line-up/billy-bragg/ |title=Turin Brakes |publisher=Together the People |date=2015-09-06 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attila the Stockbroker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/239160 |title=Lives of the Poets: Attila the Stockbroker by Justin Hopper |publisher=Poetry Foundation |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robb Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkworld.eu/30/e/robb.html |title=FolkWorld Article: Robb Johnson |website=Folkworld.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alistair Hulett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Denselow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/09/alistair-hulett-obituary |title=Alistair Hulett obituary &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Men They Couldn't Hang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Denselow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/23/the-men-they-couldnt-hang-review |title=The Men They Couldn't Hang review – rowdy 30th anniversary shindig &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsmith.com/temp/tvsmith_oz_interview.pdf |format=PDF |title=Keeping You Informed article |website=Tvsmith.com |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chumbawamba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/chumbawamba-they-got-knocked-down-793921.html |title=Chumbawamba: They got knocked down... |website=[[The Independent]] |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently [[Chris T-T]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespace.org/news/view/chris-tt-interview |title=News |publisher=The Space |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grace Petrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/grace-petrie-singing-for-change/ |title=Grace Petrie: Singing for change |publisher=Red Pepper |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G. Lansdale and the Folksongs of Americans in the Vietnam War|journal=American Folklore|year=1989|volume=102|pages=390–411|jstor=541780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock music==
Many rock artists, as varied as [[Roger Waters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/06/an-interview-with-pink-floyds-roger-waters/ |title=An Interview with Roger Waters |website=Counterpunch.org |date=2013-12-06 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan |first=Ivan |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/crosby-stills-nash-young-ohio-kent-state-shooting/ |title=The Story of "Ohio" &amp;#124; Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame |website=Rockhall.com |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Springsteen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/bring-on-your-wrecking-ball/ |title=Bring on your wrecking ball: the politics of Bruce Springsteen |publisher=Red Pepper |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Steven]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-steve-van-zandt/ |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Steve Van Zandt |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=2013-11-22 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rage Against the Machine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/233089/ratm.htm#1 |title=The Politics Behind Rage Against The Machine's Biggest Songs |publisher=Tone Deaf |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manic Street Preachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/blog_comments/rebel_music_5_manic_street_preachers |title=Farewell from NLP |publisher=New Left Project |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megadeth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-sellsbut-whos-buying-mw0000650486 |title=Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? - Megadeth &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enter Shikari]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Gittins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/17/enter-shikari-review |title=Enter Shikari – review &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Architects (British band)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Ewens |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/trolling-changing-the-world-and-uk-rock-with-architect |title=Architects – interview &amp;#124; |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[System of a Down]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/08/29/system-of-a-down-serj-tankian-mitt-romney_n_1840731.html |title=System of a Down's Serj Tankian Talks Obama, Romney and Why He'll Never Run For Office |website=Huffingtonpost.ca |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sonic Boom Six]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131021143749/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/10/21/sonic-boom-six-on-why-there-are-still-lots-of-bands-about-that-do-have-elements-of-social-commentary-out-there/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; have had openly political messages in their music. The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was banned from broadcast by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sex-pistols-mn0000418740/biography |title=Sex Pistols &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|1977]] due to its presumed anti-[[Royalism]], partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a "fascist regime". The following year, the release of debut Crass album [[The Feeding Of the 5000]] was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Grimes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-history-of-music-censorship-9051887.html |title=A history of music censorship |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their [[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]] album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their [[Frankenchrist]] album artwork.&lt;ref name="DKs"/&gt;

[[The Clash]] are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or [[Political nihilism|nihilistic]] attack of many early punk bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonino D’Ambrosio |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2003/06/01/let-fury-have-the-hour-the-passionate-politics-of-joe-strummer |title='Let Fury Have the Hour': The Passionate Politics of Joe Strummer by Antonino D’Ambrosio |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clash-mn0000075747/biography |title=The Clash &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/[[new wave music|new wave]] bands such as [[The Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]] and [[Newtown Neurotics]], and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as [[White Riot|racial tension]], [[Career Opportunities (song)|unemployment]], [[Garageland (song)|class resentment]], [[London's Burning (The Clash song)|urban alienation]] and police violence, as well as [[I'm So Bored with the USA|imperialism]].

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

===Rock the Vote===
[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php |title=About Rock the Vote |website=Rockthevote.com |date=1993-02-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to "build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120930064408/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F12-19-2007%2F0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007%2C+09%3A00+AM ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade hip hop band [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] became "perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group"&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2010/06/15/hip-hop-and-politics-have-a-long-history-behind-the-mic/|title=Hip-hop and politics have a long history behind the mic - theGrio|date=15 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a series of records whose message and success "directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as [[X Clan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/x-clan-mn0000585601/biography|title=X Clan - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poor Righteous Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poor-righteous-teachers-mn0000852698/biography|title=Poor Righteous Teachers - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brand Nubian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brand-nubian-mn0000933772/biography|title=Brand Nubian - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG|2 Black 2 Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-black-2-strong-mn0000899479/biography|title=2 Black 2 Strong - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
Racist music or [[white power music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orientalism''''' is a 1978 book by [[Edward W. Said]], in which the author discusses [[Orientalism]], defined as [[Western world|the West]]'s patronizing representations of "[[Orient|The East]]"—the societies and peoples who inhabit the places of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. According to Said, orientalism (the Western scholarship about the [[Eastern World]]) is inextricably tied to the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] societies who produced it, which makes much Orientalist work inherently political and servile to [[power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition. (1999) p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Said, in the Middle East, the social, economic, and cultural practices of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] Arab élites indicate they are imperial [[Satrapy|satraps]] who have [[internalization|internalized]] the romanticized "[[Arabic culture|Arab Culture]]" created by French, British and, later, American Orientalists; the examples include critical analyses of the [[colonialism|colonial]] literature of [[Joseph Conrad]], which conflates a people, a time, and a place into a narrative of incident and adventure in an exotic land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', Third Edition (1994), pp. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical application of [[post-structuralism]] in the scholarship of ''Orientalism'' influenced the development of [[literary theory]], cultural [[criticism]], and the field of [[Middle Eastern studies]], especially regarding how academics practice their intellectual enquiry when examining, describing, and explaining the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="newhumanist"&gt;Stephen Howe, [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1908 "Dangerous mind?"], ''New Humanist'', Vol. 123, November/December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of Said's scholarship established ''Orientalism'' as a foundation text in the field of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial culture studies]], which examines the denotations and connotations of Orientalism, and the history of a country's post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', Third Edition (1994), pp. 642–43, 581–83&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Edward Said debated Orientalism with historians and scholars of [[area studies]], notably, the historian [[Bernard Lewis]], who described the thesis of ''Orientalism'' as "anti-Western".&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Grabar, Edward Said, Bernard Lewis, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/6517 "Orientalism: An Exchange"], ''New York Review of Books'', Vol. 29, No. 13. 12 August 1982. Accessed 4 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For subsequent editions of ''Orientalism'', Said wrote an "Afterword" (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Orientalism: "Afterword" pp. 329–352.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Preface" (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Orientalism: "Preface," pp. xi-xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; addressing criticisms of the content, substance, and style of the work as [[cultural criticism]].

==Overview==
[[Orientalism]] is the exaggeration of difference, the presumption of Western superiority, and the application of clichéd analytical models for perceiving the Oriental world.[[Orientalism (book)#cite note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] As such, Orientalism is the source of the inaccurate cultural representations that form the foundations of Western thought and perception of the Eastern world, specifically in relation to the Middle East region.

The word ‘Orientalism’ refers to at least three separate but interrelated meanings: 1) an academic tradition or field; 2) a worldview, representation, and “style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between "the Orient" and (most of the time) "the Occident"”; and 3) as a powerful political instrument of domination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The principal characteristic of Orientalism is a "subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arab-Islamic peoples and their culture", which derives from Western images of what is Oriental (cultural representations) that reduce the Orient to the fictional [[Essentialism|essences]] of "Oriental peoples" and "the places of the Orient"; such cultural representations dominate the communications ([[discourse]]) of Western peoples with and about non-Western peoples.[[Orientalism (book)#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

These cultural representations usually depict the ‘Orient’ as primitive, irrational, violent, despotic, fanatic, and essentially inferior to the westerner or native informant, and hence, ‘enlightenment’ can only occur when “traditional” and “reactionary” values are replaced by “contemporary” and “progressive” ideas that are either western or western-influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marandi|first=S.M.|date=2009|title=Constructing an Axis of Evil: Iranian Memoirs in the "Land of the Free"|url=|journal=The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences|volume=|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural background===
In practice, the imperial and colonial enterprises of the West are facilitated by [[collaborationism|collaborating]] régimes of Europeanized Arab élites who have internalized the fictional, romanticized representations of [[Arabic culture]]—the Orientalism invented by French and English Orientalists, and continued in the twentieth century by American Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds", '' Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Orientalist stereotypes of the cultures of the Eastern world have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the [[Colonialism|colonial]] ambitions and the [[Imperialism|imperial]] endeavours of the U.S. and the European powers. In that vein, about contemporary Orientalist stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims, Said said:

{{Quotation|So far as the United States seems to be concerned, it is only a slight overstatement to say that Moslems and Arabs are essentially seen as either [[OPEC|oil suppliers]] or [[Islamic terrorism|potential terrorists]]. Very little of the detail, the human density, the passion of Arab–Moslem life has entered the awareness of even those people whose [[Orientalism|profession]] it is to report the Arab world. What we have, instead, is a series of crude, essentialized [[caricatures]] of the Islamic world, presented in such a way as to make that world vulnerable to military aggression.|"Islam Through Western Eyes" (1980) ''The Nation'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/islam-through-western-eyes|title=Islam Through Western Eyes|last=Said|first=Edward|date=26 April 1980|work=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Thesis of Representation===
''Orientalism'' (1978) proposes that much of the Western study of Islamic civilization was an exercise in political [[intellectualism]]; a psychological exercise in the self-affirmation of "[[Essentialism|European identity]]"; not an objective exercise of intellectual enquiry and the academic study of Eastern cultures. Therefore, Orientalism was a method of practical and cultural discrimination that was applied to non-European societies and peoples in order to establish European imperial [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]. In justification of empire, the Orientalist claims to know more—essential and definitive knowledge—about the Orient than do the Orientals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; That Western writings about the Orient, the perceptions of the East presented in Orientalism, cannot be taken at face value, because they are cultural representations based upon fictional, Western images of the Orient. That the history of European colonial rule and political domination of Eastern civilizations, distorts the intellectual [[Neutrality (philosophy)|objectivity]] of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Western Orientalist; thus did the term "Orientalism" become a pejorative word regarding non–Western peoples and cultures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/16/middleeast.islam|title=Orientalism today is just another form of insult|last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|date=16 June 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|I doubt if it is controversial, for example, to say that an Englishman in India, or Egypt, in the later nineteenth century, took an interest in those countries, which was never far from their status, in his mind, as British colonies. To say this may seem quite different from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow tinged and impressed with, violated by, the gross political fact—and yet {{em|that is what I am saying}} in this study of Orientalism.|''Orientalism'' (1978) p. 11.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}The notion of cultural representations as a means for domination and control would remain a central feature of Said’s critical approach proposed in ''Orientalism'' (1978). Towards the end of his life for instance, Said argued that while representations are essential for the function of human life and societies – as essential as language itself – what must cease are representations that are authoritatively repressive, because they do not provide any real possibilities for those being represented to intervene in this process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power, Politics, and Culture: Interviews with Edward W. Said|last=Said|first=Edward|publisher=Vintage|year=2001|isbn=|editor-last=Viswanathan|editor-first=Gauri|location=New York|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative to an exclusionary representational system for Said would be one that is “participatory and collaborative, non-coercive, rather than imposed”, yet he recognised the extreme difficulty involved in bringing about such an alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Difficult because advances in the “electronic transfer of images” is increasing media concentration in the hands of powerful, transnational conglomerates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This concentration is of such great magnitude that ‘dependent societies’ situated outside of the “central metropolitan zones” are greatly reliant upon these systems of representation for information about themselves - otherwise known as self-knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Said, this process of gaining self-knowledge by peripheral societies is insidious, because the system upon which they rely is presented as natural and real, such that it becomes practically unassailable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Occidental and Oriental origins===
[[File:Kaulbach, Wilhelm von - Die Seeschlacht bei Salamis - 1868.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The Græco–Persian Wars: ''The Sea Battle at Salamis'' (1868, Wilhelm von Kaulbach), depicts the East–West clash of civilisations.]]

Said said that the Western world sought to dominate the Eastern world for more than 2,000 years, since [[Classical antiquity]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), the time of the play ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BC), by [[Aeschylus]], which celebrates a [[Battle of Salamis|Greek victory]] (Battle of Salamis, 480 BC) against the Persians in the course of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] (499–449 BC)—imperial conflict between the Greek West and the Persian East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', M.C. Howatson, Editor. 1990, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's long, military domination of Asia ([[Imperialism|empire]] and [[hegemony]]) made unreliable most Western texts about the Eastern world, because of the implicit [[cultural bias]] that permeates most Orientalism, which was not recognized by most Western scholars.

In the course of empire, after the physical-and-political conquest, there followed the intellectual conquest of a people, whereby Western scholars appropriated for themselves (as European intellectual property) the [[Semantics|interpretation]] and [[translation]] of Oriental languages, and the critical study of the cultures and histories of the Oriental world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory'', Third Edition, J.A. Cuddon, Editor. 1991, pp. 660–65.&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, by using Orientalism as the intellectual norm for cultural judgement, Europeans wrote the history of Asia, and invented the "exotic East" and the "inscrutable Orient", which are cultural representations of peoples and things considered inferior to the peoples and things of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Other===
''Orientalism'' concluded that "Western knowledge of the Eastern world", i.e. [[Orientalism]] fictionally depicts the Orient as an irrational, psychologically weak, and feminized, non-European [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], which is negatively contrasted with the rational, psychologically strong, and masculine West. Such a binary relation, in a hierarchy of weakness and strength, derives from the European psychological need to create a [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] of cultural inequality, between West and East, which inequality is attributable to "immutable cultural [[Essentialism|essences]]" inherent to Oriental peoples and things.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of an Orient has played a central role in constructing European culture, and “helped to define Europe (or the West) as its contrasting image, idea, personality, experience”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The binary relationship of strong-West-and-weak-East reinforces the cultural stereotypes invented with [[Yellow peril|literary]], cultural, and historical texts that are more fictitious than factual; yet, which give the reader of Orientalist texts (history, travelogue, anthropology, etc.) a limited understanding of life in the Middle East, because Orientalism conflates the different societies of the Eastern world, into the homogeneous world of "the Orient".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/edward_said_orientalism.pdf ''Edward Said and The Production of Knowledge''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031314/http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/edward_said_orientalism.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}, by [[Arjun Sethi (businessman)|Sethi, Arjun]] (University of Maryland) accessed 20 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geopolitics and cultural hierarchy===
The contemporary, historical impact of ''Orientalism'' (1978) was in explaining the ''How?'' and the ''Why?'' of imperial impotence; in the 1970s, to journalists, academics, and Orientalists, the [[Yom Kippur war]] (6–25 October 1973) and the [[1973 oil crisis|OPEC petroleum embargo]] (October 1973 – March 1974) were recent [[modern history]]. The Western world had been surprised, by the pro-active and decisive actions of non-Western peoples, whom the ideology of Orientalism had defined as [[Essentialism|essentially]] weak societies and impotent countries. The [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] reality of their actions, of military and economic warfare, voided the fictional nature of [[Representation (arts)|Orientalist representations]], attitudes, and opinions about the non-Western [[Other (philosophy)|Other self]].&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Afterword", ''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 329–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The academy===
Moving from the assertion that ‘pure knowledge’ is simply not possible (as all forms of knowledge are inevitably influenced by ideological standpoints), Said sought to explain the connection between ideology and literature. He argued that “Orientalism is not a mere political subject or field that is reflected passively by culture, scholarship, or institutions”, but rather “a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and philological texts”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; European literature for Said carried, actualised, and propelled Orientalist notions forward and constantly reinforced them. Put differently, literature produced by Europeans made possible the domination of the people of the ‘East’ because of the Orientalist discourse embedded within these texts. Literature here is understood as a kind of carrier and distributor of ideology.

Edward Said's method of [[poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] analysis derived from the analytic techniques of [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]]; and the perspectives to Orientalism presented by [[Abdul Latif Tibawi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tibawi | first1 = A.L. | year = 1964 | title = English-speaking Orientalists: A Critique of Their Approach to Islam and Arab Nationalism | url = | journal = Islamic Quarterly | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 25–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anouar Abdel-Malek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdel-Malek | first1 = Anour | year = 1963 | title = L'orientalisme en crise" ("Orientalism in Crisis") | url = | journal = Diogène | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 109–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxime Rodinson]],&lt;ref&gt;"Bilan des études mohammadiennes", ''Revue Historique'' (1963) p. 465.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard William Southern.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Richard William.

===Post-colonial Culture Studies===
As a work of cultural criticism, ''Orientalism'' (1978) is the foundation document in the field of [[Post-colonialism]], because the thesis proved historically factual, true, and accurate for the periods studied; and for the ''How?'' and the ''Why?'' of the [[Representation (arts)|cultural representation]]s of “Orientals”, “[[The Orient]]”, and “[[Eastern world|The Eastern world]]” as presented in the mass communications media of the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, book review of ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'', by Robert Irwin. [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/152571], ''New Statesman'', 13 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-colonial theory studies the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and the continued dominance of Western ways of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]] and the production of [[knowledge]] in the academic, intellectual, and cultural spheres of the de-colonised country. Said's survey concentrated upon the British and the French varieties of Orientalism that supported the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] as commercial enterprises constructed from colonialism, and gave perfunctory coverage, discussion, and analyses of German Orientalist scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200602130032 ''Eastern Block'' (book review of ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'', 2006, by Robert Irwin)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118042021/http://www.newstatesman.com/200602130032 |date=18 November 2009 }}, ''New Statesman'', 13 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such disproportional investigation provoked criticism from opponents and embarrassment for supporters of Said, who, in “Orientalism Reconsidered” (1985), said that no one opponent provided a rationale, by which limited coverage of German Orientalism limits either the scholarly value or the practical application of ''Orientalism'' as a cultural study.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Afterword to the 1995 edition of ''Orientalism'', Said presented follow-up refutations of the criticisms that the Orientalist and historian [[Bernard Lewis]] made against the book's first edition (1978).&lt;ref name="Edward Said 1985, p. 96"&gt;Edward Said, "Orientalism Reconsidered", ''Cultural Critique'' magazine, No. 1, Autumn 1985, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' 329–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary criticism===
In the fields of [[literary criticism]] and of [[cultural studies]], the notable Indian scholars of post-colonialism were [[Gayatri Spivak|Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] (''In Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics'', 1987) whose essay ''[[Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1988) also became a foundational text of Post-colonial culture studies;&lt;ref&gt;Chakravorty Spivak, Gayatri.

''Nation and Narration'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inden]] (''Imagining India'', 1990);&lt;ref&gt;Inden, Ronald. ''Imagining India'', New York: Oxford UP, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gyan Prakash]] ("Writing Post–Orientalist Histories of the Third World: Perspectives from Indian Historiography", 1990);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prakash | first = Gyan | author-link = Gyan Prakash | date = April 1990 | title = Writing Post-Orientalist Histories of the Third World: Perspectives from Indian Historiography | journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 383–408 | doi=10.1017/s0010417500016534 | jstor = 178920}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Dirks]] (''Castes of Mind'', 2001);&lt;ref&gt;Dirks, Nicholas. ''Castes of Mind'', Princeton: Princeton UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hamid Dabashi]] (''[[Iran: A People Interrupted]]'', 2007).

In ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'' (1990), [[Robert J. C. Young]] reported Post-colonial explanations of the "How?" and the "Why?" of the nature of the post-colonial world, the peoples, and their discontents;&lt;ref name="ryoung"&gt;Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emory University, Department of English, [http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Intro.html Introduction to Postcolonial Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; which verify the efficacy of the critical method applied in ''Orientalism'' (1978), especially in the field of [[Middle Eastern studies]].&lt;ref name="newhumanist"/&gt;

In the late 1970s, the survey range of ''Orientalism'' (1978) did not include the genre of [[Orientalist painting]] or any other visual arts, despite the book-cover featuring a detail-image of ''[[The Snake Charmer]]'' (1880), a popular, 19th-century Orientalist painting—to which the writer [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's method of critical analysis "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, Nicholas, and others, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'', pp. 6, 11 (quoted), pp. 23–25, 2008, Tate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-733-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[Epistemology|epistemological studies]], ''Orientalism'' is an extended application of methods of critical analysis developed by the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clifford | first1 = J | year = 1980 | title = Orientalism [book review] | url = | journal = History &amp; Theory | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 204–223 | doi=10.2307/2504800| jstor = 2504800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Talal Asad]] said that the book ''Orientalism'' is:

{{Quotation| not only a catalogue of Western prejudices about and misrepresentations of Arabs and Muslims" ... [but an investigation and analysis of the] authoritative structure of Orientalist discourse—the closed, self-evident, self-confirming character of that distinctive discourse, which is reproduced, again and again, through scholarly texts, travelogues, literary works of imagination, and the ''obiter dicta'' of public men-of-affairs.&lt;ref name="Asad, T 1980 p648"&gt;Asad, T. (1980) ''English Historical Review'', p. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKOqIJEQxx4HzzSye9C_JyWmf5aCcQKI/view  648]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The historian Gyan Prakash said that ''Orientalism'' describes how "the hallowed image of the Orientalist, as an austere figure, unconcerned with the world and immersed in the mystery of foreign scripts and languages, has acquired a dark hue as the murky business of [[Imperialism|ruling]] other [[Colonialism|peoples]], now forms the essential and enabling background of his or her scholarship" about the Orient; without colonial imperialism, there would be no Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prakash | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Orientalism Now | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 199–200 | doi=10.2307/2505621| jstor = 2505621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental Europe===
In [[Eastern Europe]], Milica Bakić-Hayden developed the concept of [[Nesting Orientalisms]] (1992), based upon and derived from the work of the historian Larry Wolff (''Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment'', 1994), and the ideas Edward Said presented in ''Orientalism'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashbrook |first=John E |title=Buying and Selling the Istrian Goat: Istrian Regionalism, Croatian Nationalism, and EU Enlargement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9VVZ1esGwC&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=New York |isbn=90-5201-391-8 |oclc=213599021 |page=22 |quote=Milica Bakić-Hayden built on Wolff's work, incorporating the ideas of Edward Said's "Orientalism"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulgarian historian [[Maria Todorova]] (''[[Imagining the Balkans]]'', 1997) presented her [[Ethnology|ethnologic]] concept of Nesting Balkanisms (''Ethnologia Balkanica'',1997), which is thematically extended and theoretically derived from Milica Bakić-Hayden's Nesting Orientalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=1995 |publisher=Prof. M. Drinov Academic Pub. House |location=Sofia |oclc=41714232 |page=37|quote=The idea of "Nesting Orientalisms", in Bakić-Hayden (1995), and the related concept of "Nesting balkanisms", in Todorova (1997) ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in "A Stereotype, Wrapped in a Cliché, Inside a Caricature: Russian Foreign Policy and Orientalism" (2010), James D. J. Brown said that Western stereotypes of Russia, Russianness, and things Russian are cultural representations derived from the literature of "[[Russian studies]]", which is a field of enquiry little afflicted with the misconceptions of Russia-as-the-Other, but does display the characteristics of Orientalism—the exaggeration of difference, the presumption of Western cultural superiority, and the application of cliché in analytical models. That overcoming such intellectual malaise requires that area scholars choose to break their "mind-forg'd manacles" and deeply reflect upon the basic cultural assumptions of their area-studies scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2010.01378.x | volume=30 | title=A Stereotype, Wrapped in a Cliché, inside a Caricature: Russian Foreign Policy and Orientalism | year=2010 | journal=Politics | pages=149–159 | last1 = Brown | first1 = James D.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''Orientalism'' proved intellectually, professionally, and personally controversial. The thesis, content, substance, and style were much criticised by Orientalist academics, such as [[Albert Hourani]] (''[[A History of the Arab Peoples]]'', 1991), [[Robert Graham Irwin]] (''[[For Lust of Knowing|For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and their Enemies]]'', 2006), [[Nikki Keddie]] (''An Islamic Response to Imperialism, 1968)'', and [[Bernard Lewis]] ("The Question of Orientalism", ''Islam and the West'', 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, "The Question of Orientalism", ''Islam and the West'', London, 1993: pp. 99, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin, ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'', London: Allen Lane, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kramer, [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3082 "Enough Said (review of Robert Irwin, ''Dangerous Knowledge'')"], March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of a book by [[Ibn Warraq]], American classicist [[Bruce Thornton]] dismissed ''Orientalism'' as an "incoherent amalgam of dubious postmodern theory, sentimental Third Worldism, glaring historical errors, and Western guilt".&lt;ref name="ThorntonGoldenThreads"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Bruce|title=Golden Threads|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/golden-threads-9445.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=City Journal|date=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book-review article "Enough Said" (2007), about ''Dangerous Knowledge'' (2007), by [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], in the preface paragraphs, [[Martin Kramer]] recapitulates the professional trials and tribulations of and repercussions to Orientalists caused by ''Orientalism'' (1978):
[[File:Edward William Lane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Good Orientalist: Edward William Lane, the translator and lexicographer who compiled the ''Arabic–English Lexicon'' (1863–93).]]
{{Quotation|the British historian Robert Irwin is the sort of scholar who, in times past, would have been proud to call himself an Orientalist ... someone who mastered difficult languages, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], and then spent years bent over manuscripts, in heroic efforts of [[Translation|decipherment]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]]. In ''Dangerous Knowledge'', Irwin relates that the 19th-century English Arabist [[Edward William Lane]], compiler of the great '' [[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' [1840], "used to complain that he had become so used to the cursive calligraphy of his Arabic manuscripts that he found Western print a great strain on his eyes."

Orientalism, in its heyday, was a branch of knowledge as demanding and rigorous as its near cousin, [[Egyptology]]. The first International Congress of Orientalists met in 1873; its name was not changed until a full century later. But there are no self-declared Orientalists today. The reason is that the late Edward Said turned the word into a pejorative. In his 1978 book ''Orientalism'', the Palestinian-born Said, a professor of [[comparative literature]] at Columbia University, claimed that an endemic Western prejudice against the East had congealed into a modern ideology of racist supremacy—a kind of [[anti-Semitism]] directed against Arabs and Muslims. Throughout Europe's history, announced Said, "every European, in that he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric."

In a [[Semantics|semantic]] sleight of hand, Said appropriated the term "Orientalism", as a label for the ideological prejudice he described, thereby, neatly implicating the scholars who called themselves Orientalists. At best, charged Said, the work of these scholars was biased, so as to confirm the inferiority of Islam. At worst, Orientalists had directly served European empires, showing [[proconsul]]s how best to conquer and control Muslims. To substantiate his indictment, Said cherry-picked evidence, ignored whatever contradicted his thesis, and filled the gaps with conspiracy theories.|"Enough Said", ''Commentary'' magazine (March 2007)}}

Nonetheless, the literary critic [[Paul De Man]] said that, as a literary critic, "Said took a step further than any other modern scholar of his time, something I dare not do. I remain in the safety of rhetorical analysis, where criticism is the second-best thing I do."&lt;ref&gt;Nosal, K R. ''American Criticism'', New York Standard, New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:OttomanEmpire1683.png|thumb|right|400px|The Oriental threat in the 17th century: the Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent, in 1683.]]
In the book review, "The Mightier Pen? Edward Said and the Double Standards of Inside-out Colonialism: a review of ''Culture and Imperialism'', by Edward Said" (1993), [[Ernest Gellner]] said that Said's contention of Western domination of the Eastern world for more than 2,000 years was unsupportable, because, until the late 17th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299–1923) was a realistic military, cultural, and religious threat to (Western) Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gellner, "The Mightier Pen? Edward Said and the Double Standards of Inside-out Colonialism" (rev. of ''Culture and Imperialism'' by Edward Said), ''Times Literary Supplement'', 19 February 1993: pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Disraeli as an Orientalist: The Polemical Errors of Edward Said" (2005), Mark Proudman noted incorrect 19th-century history in ''Orientalism'', that the geographic extent of the [[British Empire]] was not from Egypt to India in the 1880s, because the Ottoman Empire and the [[Persian Empire]] in that time intervened between those poles of empire.&lt;ref&gt;Mark F. Proudman, "[http://canadianreview.ca/MFP/Proudman%20-%20JHS%20-%20Disraeli%20and%20Said.pdf Disraeli as an Orientalist: The Polemical Errors of Edward Said] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630144025/http://canadianreview.ca/MFP/Proudman%20-%20JHS%20-%20Disraeli%20and%20Said.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }}," ''Journal of the Historical Society'', 5 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, at the zenith of the [[Imperialism|imperial era]], European colonial power in the Eastern world never was absolute, it was relative and much dependent upon [[Collaborationism|local collaborators]] — princes, rajahs, and warlords—who nonetheless often subverted the imperial and hegemonic aims of the colonialist power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] ''Empire and Information'', Delhi: Cambridge UP, 1999: pp. 25, 143, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'' (2006), Robert Irwin said that Said's concentrating the scope of ''Orientalism'' to the Middle East, especially Palestine and Egypt, was a mistake, because the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]] (1920–1948) and [[History of Egypt under the British|British Egypt]] (1882–1956) only were under direct European control for a short time, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; thus are poor examples for Said's theory of Western [[cultural imperialism]]. That ''Orientalism'' should have concentrated upon good examples of imperialism and [[cultural hegemony]], such as the [[British Raj|British Raj of India]] (1858–1947) and [[Russian empire|Russia's dominions in Asia]] (1721–1917), but he did not, because, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Edward Said was more interested in making political points about the politics of the Middle East, in general, and of Palestine, in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'' London: Allen Lane, 2006: pp. 159–60, 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, that by unduly concentrating on British and French Orientalism, Said ignored the domination of 19th century Oriental studies by German and Hungarian academics and intellectuals, whose countries did not possess an Eastern empire.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, ''For Lust of Knowing'': pp. 8, 155–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin's book was later criticized by Amir Taheri, writing in Asharq Al-Awsat, when he listed a number of factual and editing errors that Irwin makes in the book, also noting a number of prominent Orientalists left unmentioned.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aawsat.com/2006/05/article55266710/for-lust-of-knowing&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[Religious studies|scholar of religion]] Jason Ānanda Josephson has argued that data from [[Japan]] complicates Said's thesis about Orientalism as a field linked to imperial power. Not only did Europeans study Japan without any hope of colonizing it, but Japanese academics played a prominent role as informants and interlocutors in this academic discipline, providing information both on their own practices and history and on the history of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=245-50|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Josephson has documented that European conferences on [[East Asia]] predate European conferences on the Middle East described by Said, necessitating an alternative chronology of Western academic interest in the Orient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=192-4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional===
[[File:Arab-Israeli Map1.png|thumb|right|400px|The geographic extent of the Arab–Israeli Conflict. (1948 – to date)]]
In the article "Said's Splash" (2001), Martin Kramer said that, fifteen years after publication of ''Orientalism'' (1978), the UCLA historian [[Nikki Keddie]] (whom Said praised in ''Covering Islam'', 1981) who originally had praised ''Orientalism'' as an 'important, and, in many ways, positive' book, had changed her mind. In ''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'' (1994), Keddie criticised Said's work on Orientalism, for the unfortunate consequences upon her profession as an historian:
 
{{Quotation|I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East field to adopt the word "orientalism" as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the "wrong" position on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab–Israeli dispute]], or to people who are judged too "conservative". It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines. So, "orientalism", for many people, is a word that substitutes for [[Intellectualism|thought]] and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works. I think that is too bad. It may not have been what Edward Said meant at all, but the term has become a kind of slogan. |"Said's Splash", ''Ivory Towers on Sand'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/SaidSplash.htm "Said's Splash"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ko3VRaot?url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/SaidSplash.htm |date=2009-10-26 }} ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'', Policy Papers 58 (Washington, D.C.: Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Literature===
In the article, "Edward Said's Shadowy Legacy" (2008), Robert Irwin said that Said ineffectively distinguished among writers of different centuries and genres of Orientalist literature. That the disparate examples, such as the German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) who never travelled to the Orient; the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]] (1821–1880) who briefly toured Egypt; the French Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), whose anti-Semitism voided his work; and the British Arabist [[Edward William Lane]] (1801–1876), who compiled the ''Arabic–English Lexicon'' (1863–93)—did not constitute a comprehensive scope of investigation or critical comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3885948.ece "Edward Said's shadowy legacy"], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 7 May 2008. Accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, in ''Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism'' (2007), Ibn Warraq earlier had said that in ''Orientalism'' (1978) Said had constructed a binary-opposite representation, a fictional European stereotype that would counter-weigh the Oriental stereotype. Being European is the only common trait among such a temporally and stylistically disparate group of literary Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Philosophy===
[[File:Palestine frontier 1922.png|thumb|right|235px|The British Mandate of Palestine (1922).]]
In ''The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India's Past'' (1988) O.P. Kejariwal said that with the creation of a monolithic [[Occidentalism]] to oppose the Orientalism of Western discourse with the Eastern world, Said had failed to distinguish, between the paradigms of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and ignored the differences among Orientalists; and that he failed to acknowledge the positive contributions of Orientalists who sought kinship, between the worlds of the East and the West, rather than to create an artificial "difference" of cultural inferiority and superiority; such a man was [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] (1746–1794), the British philologist–lexicographer who proposed that Indo–European languages are interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;O.P. Kejariwal, ''The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India's Past'', Delhi: Oxford UP, 1988: pp. ix–xi, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay ''The Debate About 'Orientalism''', [[Harry Oldmeadow]] said "that Said’s treatment of Orientalism, particularly the assertion of the necessary nexus with imperialism, is over-stated and unbalanced." He objected to Said's view that Western Orientalists were projecting upon the "artificial screen called “the East” or “the Orient”, but that such projection was only a small part of the relationship. That Said failed to adequately distinguish between the genuine experiences of the Orient and the cultural projections of Westerners. He further criticized Said for using reductionist models of religion and spirituality, that are based on "Marxist/Foucauldian/psychoanalytic thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions|last=Oldmeadow|first=Harry|publisher=World Wisdom, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0941532577|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
In the sociological article, "Review: Who is Afraid of Edward Said?" (1999) Biswamoy Pati said that in making [[ethnicity]] and cultural background the tests of [[moral authority]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|intellectual objectivity]] in studying the Oriental world, Said drew attention to his personal identity as a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and as a [[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|subaltern]] of the British Empire, in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Biswamoy Pati, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3518106 "Review: Who Is Afraid of Edward Said?"]. ''Social Scientist'', Vol. 27. No. 9/10 (Sept.–Oct. 1999), pp. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the perspective of the Orientalist academic, Said's personal background might, arguably, exclude him from writing about the Oriental world, hindered by an upper-class birth, an Anglophone upbringing, a British-school education in Cairo, residency in the U.S., a university-professor job; and categorical statements, such as: "any and all representations ... are embedded, first, in the language, and then, in the culture, institutions, and political ambience of the representer ... [the cultural representations are] interwoven with a great many other things, besides 'the Truth', which is, itself, a representation."&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'': p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, in the article "Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire", D.A. Washbrook said that Said and his academic cohort indulge in excessive [[cultural relativism]], which intellectual excess traps them in a "[[Solipsism|web of solipsism]]", which limits conversation exclusively to "cultural representations" and to denying the existence of {{em|any}} [[objective truth]].&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Washbrook, "Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire", in ''Historiography'', vol. 5 of ''The Oxford History of the British Empire'' p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt; That Said and his followers fail to distinguish between the types and degrees of Orientalism represented by the news media and popular culture (e.g., the light Orientalism of the children's movie ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', 1984), and heavy academic Orientalism about the language and literature, history and culture of the peoples of the Eastern world.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward, "Afterword", ''Orientalism'' (1978) 1995 ed. p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaizaad Navroze Kotwal, [http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue12/templeofdoom.html "Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as Virtual Reality: The Orientalist and Colonial Legacies of Gunga Din,"] ''The Film Journal'' no. 12, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article "Orientalism Now" (1995), the historian Gyan Prakash said that Edward Said had explored fields of Orientalism already surveyed by his predecessors and contemporaries, such as [[Victor Kiernan|V. G. Kiernan]], [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard S. Cohn]], and [[Anwar Abdel Malek]], who also had studied, reported, and interpreted the social relationship that makes the practice of imperialism intellectually, psychologically, and ethically feasible; that is, the relationship between European imperial rule and European representations of the non-European Other self, the colonised people.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prakash | first1 = G. | year = 1995 | title = Orientalism Now | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 3| page = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That, as an academic investigator, Said already had been preceded in the critical analysis of the production of Orientalist knowledge and about Western methods of Orientalist scholarship, because, in the 18th century, "[[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]] [1753–1825], the Egyptian chronicler, and a witness to [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798]], for example, had no doubt that the expedition was as much an [[epistemological]] as military conquest". Nonetheless, [[George Landow (professor)|George Landow]], of Brown University, who criticized Said's scholarship and contested his conclusions, acknowledged that ''Orientalism'' is a major work of cultural criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/post/poldiscourse/said/orient14.html |title=Edward W.

===Posthumous===
In October 2003, one month after the death of Edward W. Said (1935–2003), the Lebanese newspaper ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'' recognized the [[intellectual]] import of the book, saying "Said's critics agree with his admirers that he has single-handedly effected a revolution in Middle Eastern studies in the U.S." and that "U.S. Middle Eastern Studies were taken over, by Edward Said's postcolonial studies [[paradigm]]", ''Orientalism''.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Star'', 20 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13400">A '''perverse incentive''' is an [[incentive]] that has an unintended and undesirable result which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers. Perverse incentives are a type of negative [[unintended consequence]] or [[cobra effect]].

==Examples==

{{example farm|section|date=October 2015}}}}
* In [[Hanoi]], under French colonial rule, a program paying people a bounty for each rat tail handed in was intended to exterminate rats. Instead, it led to the farming of rats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael G. Vann]], "Of Rats, Rice, and Race: The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, an Episode in French Colonial History," French Colonial History Society, May, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Duplessis Orphans]]: Between 1945 and 1960, the federal Canadian government paid 70 cents a day per orphan to orphanages, and psychiatric hospitals received $2.25 per day, per patient. Allegedly, up to 20,000 orphaned children were falsely certified as mentally ill so the government of the province of [[Quebec]] could get $2.25 per day, per patient.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 Protesters in straitjackets demand inquiry of Duplessis Orphans era]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 Allegations of child abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 Orphans sue Catholic orders over mistreatment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extermination of sparrows in China that ate grain per the [[Four Pests Campaign]] led to the explosion of the Locust population and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the [[Great Leap Forward]].
* Funding [[fire department]]s by the number of fire calls made is intended to reward the fire departments that do the most work. However, it may discourage them from fire-prevention activities, which reduce the number of fires.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government (2002). [http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf "Fire"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040801032503/http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf |date=2004-08-01 }}. In ''Consultation on the Local Government Finance Formula Grant Distribution''. Retrieved November 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*19th century [[palaeontology|palaeontologists]] travelling to [[China]] used to pay peasants for each fragment of [[dinosaur]] bone (dinosaur [[fossils]]) that they produced. They later discovered that the peasants dug up the bones and then smashed them into many pieces, greatly reducing their scientific value, to maximise their payments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Chinese peasants vs. palaeontologists example}}
* Paying medical professionals and reimbursing insured patients for treatment but not prevention encourages medical conditions to be ignored until treatment is required.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Robinson,
Reinvention of Health Insurance in the Consumer Era (2004). In ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]], April 21, 2004; 291: 1880–1886''. Retrieved 2008-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; Also, paying only for treatment effectively discourages prevention (which would reduce the demand for future treatments and would also improve quality of life for the patient). Payment for treatment also generates a perverse incentive for unnecessary treatments which could be harmful, for example in the form of side effects of drugs and surgery. These side effects themselves can then trigger a demand for further treatments.
* [[Bangkok]] police used [[tartan]] armbands as a badge of shame for minor infractions, but they were treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them. Since 2007, they have been using armbands with the cute [[Hello Kitty]] cartoon character to avoid the perverse incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Myndans |first=Seth |date=2007-08-25 |title=Cute Kitty Is Pink Badge of Shame in Bangkok |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/world/asia/08thai.html |accessdate=2007-11-06 |quote=It is the pink armband of shame for wayward police officers, as cute as it can be, with a Hello Kitty face and a pair of linked hearts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Endangered Species Act]] in the US imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property. While this policy is well-intentioned and has some positive effects for wildlife, it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction (draining swamps or cutting down trees that might host valuable species) by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=unintended%20consequences&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1 ''Unintended Consequences''], New York Times Magazine, 20 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, endangered species may even be [[shooting, shoveling, and shutting up|deliberately killed]] to avoid discovery. Similarly, if the fine or other penalty for committing environmental damage is perceived as less burdensome than the cost of preventing the damage in the first place, an individual or company may not place safeguards in place and simply pay the penalty if the damage occurs.
* Providing company executives with bonuses for reporting higher earnings encouraged executives at [[Fannie Mae]] and other large corporations to inflate earnings statements artificially and make decisions targeting short-term gains at the expense of long-term profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Bebchuk, L., &amp; Fried, J. M. (2005) [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1037596901/executive-compensation-at-fannie-mae-a-case-study "Executive Compensation at Fannie Mae: A Case Study of Perverse Incentives, Nonperformance Pay, and Camouflage"] ''Journal of Corporation Law'', '''30''' (4): 807–822.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], executed criminals were the only legal source of bodies for hospitals to use for surgeon training in the United Kingdom. Due to high demand from chronic shortage of legal cadavers, "[[Body-snatching|resurrection men]]" resorted to illegal means to obtain bodies, such as digging up corpses from graveyards or even murder. In 1828, [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke and William Hare]] murdered 16 people and sold the bodies. Thomas Williams and John Bishop, part of a group of body snatchers known as the [[London Burkers]], committed murder for the purpose of selling the victim's body in 1831.
* In building the [[first transcontinental railroad]] in the 1860s, the [[United States Congress]] agreed to pay the builders per mile of track laid. As a result, [[Thomas C. Durant]] of [[Union Pacific Railroad]] lengthened a section of the route forming a bow shape unnecessarily adding miles of track.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Zwonitzer, writer, PBS American Experience documentary "Transcontinental Railroad"  (2006) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/tcrr-transcript/ "Program Transcript . Transcontinental Railroad . WGBH American Experience" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[welfare trap]]" occurs when money earned through part-time or minimum-wage employment result in a reduction in [[state benefit]]s which is greater than that amount. This creates a barrier to low-income workers re-entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aims.ca/op-ed/gassing-up-the-welfare-trap-machine/ "Gassing up the welfare trap machine"], 6 January 1997, [[Atlantic Institute for Market Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying factors include a full tax exemption for public assistance while employment income is taxed, a pattern of welfare paying more per dependent child (while employers are prohibited from discriminating in this manner, and their workers often must purchase daycare), or loss of welfare eligibility for the working poor ending other means-tested benefits (public medical, dental or prescription drug plans, subsidised housing, legal aid) which are expensive to replace at full market rates. If the withdrawal of means-tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income or even a net loss, then this gives a powerful disincentive to take on such work.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* [[Real estate broker]]s have an inherent conflict of interest with sellers they represent because their usual commission structures motivate them to sell quickly more than it motivates them to sell at a higher price. However, a broker representing a buyer has a distinct disincentive to negotiate a lower price on behalf of their client, because they will simultaneously be negotiating their own commission lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why a Real Estate Agent May Skip the Extra Mile |author=Daniel Gross |date=20 Feb 2005 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529190902/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Real Estate Brokers Add Value When Listing Services Are Unbundled? |date=13 Jan 2012 |author1=B.

* Awarding carbon credits for destroying the greenhouse gas [[HFC-23]] incentivized increased manufacture of the refrigerant [[HCFC-22]] (chlorodifluoromethane) whose production included HFC-23 as a by-product.

* Under the US [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program, doctors are reimbursed at a higher rate if they prescribe more expensive medications to treat a condition. This creates an incentive for the physician to prescribe a more expensive drug when a less expensive one might do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/upshot/medicare-tries-an-experiment-to-fight-perverse-incentives.html|title=Medicare Tries an Experiment to Fight Perverse Incentives|last=Sanger-katz|first=Margot|date=2016-03-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[devolved]] government in [[Northern Ireland]] enabled business owners to make profits guaranteed for 20 years by simply using more and more heating energy to heat their premises in their [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Renewable Heat Incentive]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38414486|title=RHI scandal: RHI 'cash for ash' scandal to cost NI taxpayers £490m|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the scheme were to ''reduce'' energy usage and promote switching to [[Environmentally friendly|green]] sources.
* The [[Wells Fargo account fraud scandal]] resulted from incentives intended to increase the number of accounts sold, but overly ambitious quotas combined with the threat of career ruin if quotas were not met caused some employees to open large numbers of accounts without customer permission.
* The 2008 housing crisis resulted in 27 million subprime mortages outstanding which government sponsored enterprises were mandated by government to own 19.2 million. The intent was for poorer people to own homes. The result was a housing bust, which led to low house prices, which led to financial institution instabilities which caused a greater proportion of poor people to lose their homes.

'''Pir Mardakan Khanqah''' ({{lang-az|'''Pir Mərdəkan xanəgahı'''}}) is historic architectural monument located in the village of Goylar, 16 km south-west of Shamakhi district of the [[Azerbaijan Republic]]. The complex includes a tomb, a dynasty building and small auxiliary buildings. It was built in XIII-XIV centuries. According to some sources, this is the tomb of Seyid Mardakani, one of the famous scholars of his time.

==History==
Some of the remaining inscriptions on the grave stone and in the wall were read by M. Nematova.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title= PİR MƏRDƏKAN TÜRBƏSİ|url= http://shamakhi-encyclopedia.az/pir-mərdәkan-turbәsi/|publisher= shamakhi-encyclopedia.az|language= az|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these inscriptions it is shown that the monument was built in 1188 – 1203 (583 – 600 of [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]]. According to the style characteristics, history of the monument is dated back to the early XIII century.&lt;ref&gt;А. В. Салаьзаде – К датировке некоторых памятников Азербайджана, ИАНА, 1952, № 5 p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ancient cemetery, [[caravanserai]] complex around the khanqah. An inscription on the [[facade]] of the monument, written in the [[Arabic]] written in [[thuluth]] script with [[kufic]] element, says: ''"In the Name of Allah, the merciful and the gracious. This is the grave of the [[Sheikh]], the [[Imam]], the greatest scientist, the believer, Tair Taj Al-Huda Mardakani Ibn Ali. May Allah have mercy upon them..."'' &lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

It is possible to clarify history of the monument based on the second inscription on the tomb. A small part, two lines of the inscription fixed on the left wall, on the left side of entering from the door, remains: ''"The greatest [[padishah]], [[khagan]]... Farrukhzad ibn Fazilalmuwahhid Manuchihr..."'' &lt;ref&gt;M.Nemətova. "Azərbaycan pirləri". Baku: 1992, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The author explains that this is ruler is Shirvanshah [[Farrukhzad I]], the son of Shirvanshah [[Manuchihr III of Shirvan|Manuchihr III]]. He also lived in the XIII century.&lt;ref&gt;M.Nemətova. "Azərbaycan pirləri". Baku: 1992, p. 21 - 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientist notes that there is a place named Madak in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The "-ani" suffix indicates that the owner of the grave is from there. The word "Madakani" transformed into "Mardakan", over the history.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The tomb, which is a part of the complex has reached today’s era with almost its original view. These mausoleums, which have other examples in the [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|architecture of Azerbaijan]], typically consist of a combination of two-domed and tower-shaped tombs. As examples of this type of mausoleum in architecture of Azerbaijan, the tomb in Alinjachay Khanqah in Nakhchivan and other tombs can be. The plan of the Pir Mardakan mausoleum repeats the very coincidental version of the tombs  with [[dome]]s. By volume, these types of tombs consist of combination of two combinations. The bottom part is with dome and tower, and the upper part is covered with dome. The upper part looks independent from outside in terms of its composition, not as a continuation of the bottom part since usually in such tombs there is no gradual transition between cube-shaped and the upper tower parts.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Məmmədzadə - Azərbaycanda inşaat sənəti, Baku, Elm, 1978, p. 50 - 51&lt;/ref&gt;

As mausoleums with dome were temple-type buildings, people used to come and pay visit to buried and hold religious ceremonies in such places. Therefore, these type of mausoleums were also used as a mosque. Internal tomb part of the mausoleum square shaped according to structure of it and through [[squinch]]es in the corners it turns into an octagon. Eight-edged prism on the octagon is covered with pyramidal tent. When remotely looking at the tomb, it resembles an ordinary octagonal tomb because relief of the earth covers the lower-cubed portion. The size of outer walls of it is 4.6x5 m, and the internal walls are 2.6x2.6 m. The height of the square part is 3 m, the height of the pyramid is 4.7 m.

From the east side of the tomb khanqah building with three rooms is fixed. Large room is 4.4x7.3 m in size and is for worship. Only one of the rooms reached today’s era. The other two rooms are completely destroyed.

This monument belongs to a group of tombs of Azerbaijan with towers and domes according to many features of it. Monuments that share similatiries with Pir Mardakan Khanqah according to the structural and architectural features, monuments similar to Pir Mardakan Khanate are spread in other Turkic countries. For example, in [[Turkmenistan]] there are several architectural monuments repeating the architectural features of this tomb. Fakhraddin Razi and Sheikh Sharif mausoleums in Kunya-Urgench can be examples.&lt;ref&gt;Н. М. Бачинский – Архитектурные памятники Туркмении, вып 1, Ашкабад, 1939, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaldari Eschscholzia californica 01.jpg|thumb|Sara Lemmon authored the legislation to designate the [[golden poppy]] as California's state flower.]]

'''Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon''' (September 3, 1836 – January 15, 1923) was an American botanist. [[Mount Lemmon]] in Arizona is named for her for being the first [[white (race)|white]] woman to ascend it. She was responsible for the designation of the [[golden poppy]] (''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'') as the [[state flower]] of California in 1903.&lt;ref name="calbeat"&gt;[http://www.californiabeat.org/2009/05/27/california-beat-hero-sara-plummer-lemmon "California Beat Hero: Sara Plummer Lemmon"], May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plants are also named in her honor, including the new genus ''Plummera'' (now placed as a subgenus within ''[[Hymenoxys]]''&lt;ref name="bierner"&gt;Bierner, Mark W 1994 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/9302182 SUBMERSION OF DUGALDIA AND PLUMMERA IN HYMENOXYS (ASTERACEAE: HELIANTHEAE: GAILLARDIINAE)] ''Sida, Contributions To Botany'' Volume: 16:1-8&lt;/ref&gt;), described by Harvard University botanist [[Asa Gray]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dupree|first=A.

==Early years==
She was born in [[New Gloucester]], [[Maine]] on September 3, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer's gravestone indicates 1836 as her year of birth, although some accounts cite 1840. Matas, "Life Stories" (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  She was educated in Massachusetts at the [[Female College of Worcester]].&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21712917 "Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (1836–1923)"], ''Find-a-Grave''.&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer then moved to [[New York City]], teaching art there for some years,&lt;ref name="redmon"&gt;Michael Redmon, [http://www.independent.com/news/2008/apr/10/who-responsible-setting-santa-barbaras-first-libra/ "Who is responsible for setting up Santa Barbara’s first library?"], ''Santa Barbara Independent'', April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and studying at [[Cooper Union]].&lt;ref&gt;''Appletons' cyclopaedia of American biography'', Volume 7, edited by James Grant Wilson and John Fiske.&lt;/ref&gt; She also served as a nurse for a year or two during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;

==Move to California==
[[File:SkyIslandPkwy.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Mount Lemmon]], [[Arizona]], named after Sara Lemmon]]
Falling ill in 1868–69, she moved to California in 1869, after hearing from her friend how the trip helped his health.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://daily.jstor.org/sara-plummer-lemmon/|title=Sara Plummer Lemmon: Pioneering Botanist {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=JSTOR Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers of the day described Plummer as "one of the first 'intellectuals'" to move to Santa Barbara,&lt;ref&gt;Unspecified newspapers cited in Kimberly Matas, [http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_cf80a43c-066c-53fb-9f51-48143c8401ad.html "Life stories: Mt. Lemmon's namesake was female explorer"], ''Arizona Daily Star'', Oct. 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1871&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt; she established a lending library that became an important cultural center for Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; Shortly after arriving in Santa Barbara, she established the "Lending Library  and Stationery Depot", with the aid of a friend, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Henry Whitney Bellows|Henry Bellows]], who helped her acquire her first few hundred volumes.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; Operating out of a jewelry store on [[State Street, Santa Barbara|State Street]], Plummer charged $5 membership or 10 cents for borrowing books, and sold a variety of art and music supplies, and held cultural gatherings including lectures and art exhibits.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

While walking about [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], she acquired an interest in [[botany]], and turned her paintings towards [[botanical illustration]]s.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt; In 1876 Plummer met [[John Gill Lemmon|John Gill (J.G.) Lemmon]] (1831–1908) when he was giving a lecture in Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name="matas"&gt;Kimberly Matas, [http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_cf80a43c-066c-53fb-9f51-48143c8401ad.html "Life stories: Mt. Lemmon's namesake was female explorer"], ''Arizona Daily Star'', Oct. 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmon, a [[American Civil War|Civil War veteran]] and former [[Andersonville prison]]er, was, like Plummer, a self-trained botanist.&lt;ref name="matas" /&gt; The couple started corresponding via letters and Lemmon tutored her in botany. She also sent him a shrub she had found near Santa Barbara, and after a friend of his examined it, named it ''[[Baccharis plummerae]]'' in honor of her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1880 they married, Plummer assuming his name.&lt;ref name="calbeat" /&gt; At that point, she sold her library to the [[Odd Fellows]] to operate, and she and John Lemmon began traveling and cataloging botanical materials.&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

Lemmon and her husband John honeymooned in the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] near [[Tucson, Arizona]] at her recommendation.&lt;ref name="miner"&gt;Carrie M. Miner, [http://www.arizonascenicroads.com/tucson/sky_island_article_4.html "Sara Plummer Lemmon"], ''Arizona Scenic Roads'' (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the aid of E. O. Stratton, they eventually scaled the tallest peak, which they named [[Mount Lemmon]] in her honor&lt;ref name="miner" /&gt; – one of the few mountains named for a woman.&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;Leo W. Banks, [http://friendly-village.org/skyisland.htm "Sky Island Parkway"] (last visited Aug. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Stratton, ''Pioneering in Arizona: The Reminiscences of Emerson Oliver Stratton and Edith Stratton Kitt''.

After returning from their trip, they continued their botanical endeavors. The Lemmons co-developed the [[Lemmon Herbarium]] at their home at No. 5985 [[Telegraph Avenue]],&lt;ref name="guinn"&gt;James Miller Guinn, ''History of the State of California and Biographical Record of Oakland and Environs'' (1907), Historic Record Company, pp.834–835.

In 1893, she lectured on forest conservation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World’s Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1890s she also advocated for the adoption of the [[golden poppy]] as the state flower of [[California]], eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed in 1903.&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="redmon" /&gt;

==Death==
Her husband J.G. died in 1908, and Sara Plummer Lemmon died in California in 1923. The couple is buried at [[Mountain View Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Mountain View Cemetery]] in Oakland, in Plot 46, with a poppy on her gravestone.&lt;ref name="calbeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;

The '''Société des Artistes Français''' is the [[Professional association|association]] of French painters and sculptors established in 1881. Its annual exhibition is called the "Salon des artistes français" (not to be confused with the better-known [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], established in 1667).

When the Société was established, it associated all the French artists. Its president was a painter and its vice-president a sculptor. The main task of the Société is to organize the ''Salon'', since the French government ceased to do it.

== Secession ==

In December 1890 president Bouguereau suggested that the ''Salon'' should be an exhibition of young, yet unrecognized, artists. [[Ernest Meissonier]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]] and others rejected this proposal and left the organization. They quickly created their own exhibition ([[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in 1899) that was also named the ''Salon'', officially ''Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux–Arts'', in short ''Salon du Champs de Mars''.  The original ''Salon'' was sometimes called ''Salon de Champs-Élysées'', or simply ''Salon des artistes français'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10566">[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] composed his '''Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 44''' between 1935 and 1936. The Third Symphony is considered a transitional work in Rachmaninoff's output. In melodic outline and rhythm it is his most expressively Russian symphony, particularly in the dance rhythms of the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, ''Rachmaninoff'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; What was groundbreaking in this symphony was its greater economy of utterance compared to its two predecessors. This sparer style, first apparent in the ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', enhances the emotional power of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was premiered on November 6, 1936, with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Critical opinion was divided and public opinion negative toward the work. Rachmaninoff remained convinced of the piece's worth, however, and conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the first recording of the work in 1939. Following the reevaluation of Rachmaninoff's work in the 1970s, the symphony has been viewed in a more favorable light and has been frequently played and recorded.

==Form==
The symphony contains only three movements but its central one fulfills the dual role of slow movement and [[scherzo]] — a structural innovation with marked similarities to the third symphony of [[Antonín Dvořák]]. The work employs [[cyclic form]], with the subtle use of a [[leitmotif|motto theme]] combined, as usual with Rachmaninoff's works, with references to the plain-chant ''[[Dies irae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Walker, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Also like Rachmaninoff's motto themes — and thus differing from Tchaikovsky's — it is short and, by tending to assume various shapes, is easily workable for further symphonic development.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is approximately 40 minutes long.

# Lento – Allegro moderato – Allegro
# Adagio ma non troppo – Allegro vivace
# Allegro – Allegro vivace – Allegro (Tempo primo) – Allegretto – Allegro vivace.

==Composition==
Rachmaninoff composed his Third Symphony after writing his ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'' and ''[[Variations on a Theme of Corelli]]''. He arrived at his newly built [[Villa Senar]] on [[Lake Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]] in late April 1935 with the prospect of writing a symphony in mind. Satisfied with his new home and in good spirits, Rachmaninoff seemed definitely up to the task. On May 15 he informed his cousin Sofiya Satina that he had done "some work," and during the following weeks was seriously at work with the composition. However, a three-week cure at Baden-Baden in July, along with a two-week hiatus in August, put Rachmaninoff behind. Five days before leaving Senar at the end of his summer holiday, Rachmaninov wrote to Satin with some dissatisfaction, "I have finished two-thirds in clean form but the last third of the work in rough. If you take into account that the first two-thirds took seventy days of intense work, for the last third – thirty-five days – there is not enough time. Travels begin and I must get down to playing the piano. So it looks as though my work will be put aside until next year."&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 1935–36 concert season, recitals in Switzerland enabled Rachmaninoff to pay a brief visit to Senar. He evidently took the score of the symphony with him when he left, since he had it with him in Paris in February 1936 for Julius Conus to mark bowings in the string parts. Work on the last movement had to wait until the composer arrived at Senar on April 16 for the summer holiday. On June 30, the composer reported to Satina, "Yesterday morning I finished my work, of which you are the first to be informed. It is a symphony. Its first performance is promised to Stokowski—probably in November. With all my thoughts I thank God that I was able to do it!"&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Rachmaninoff arrived in America just in time for final rehearsals of the work's premiere.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for full [[orchestra]] with 3 [[flute]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s in A and B{{music|flat}}, [[bass clarinet]] in A and B{{music|flat}}, 2 [[bassoon]]s, contrabassoon, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s A and B{{music|flat}}, 1 contralto trumpet in F, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[snare drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[tam-tam]], [[xylophone]], 2 [[harp]]s, [[celesta]], and [[stringed instruments|strings]].

==Reactions==

===Critical===
The day after the Third Symphony premiered, Edwin Schloss wrote for ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'' that he found the work "a disappointment," with "echoes ... of the composer's lyric spaciousness of style" but largely sterile.&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Olin Downes]], normally a champion of the composer's works, was not so sure about this piece:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The outward characteristics of Rachmaninoff's style are evident in the work heard on this occasion. It cannot be said, however, that in these pages Mr. Rachmaninoff says things which are new, even though his idiom is more his own than ever before, and free of the indebtedness it once had to Tchaikovsky. Nor is it easy to avoid the impression, at a first hearing of the work, of a certain diffuseness. There is a tendency to over-elaboration of detail, and to unnecessary extensions, so that the last movement, in particular, appears too long. Would not a pair of shears benefit the proportions of this work?&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 324–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Samuel L. Laciar, reviewing the work for the ''Public Ledger'', gave a more positive assessment. He called the symphony "a most excellent work in musical conception, composition and orchestration," adding that Rachmaninoff "has given us another example in this work that it is not necessary to write dissonant music in order to get the originality which is the greatest—and usually the single—demand of the ultra-moderns."&lt;ref name="bl324"&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; W. J. Henderson of the ''Sun'' was perhaps most accurate in summing up both the work and the situation the critics faced in assessing it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the creation of a genial mind laboring in a field well known and loved by it, but not seeking now to raise the fruit of heroic proportions.... The first movement is orthodox in its initial statement of two contrasting chief subjects. They are contrasted in the customary way, in temper and tonality. But the working out section pays only polite respect to tradition. The development of themes immediately follows their statement and this is Rachmaninoff's method. The cantabile theme of the first movement is especially attractive in its lyric and plaintive character and the leading subject has virility and possibilities which are not neglected later. In fact, we suspect, after this insufficient first hearing, that there is more organic unity in this symphony through consanguinity of themes than is instantly discernable.&lt;ref name="bl324"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public===
The public was as confused as the critics. Listeners who enjoyed the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Concerto]]s, the [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and, more recently, the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'', came expecting a quite different work than the one they heard. As Barrie Martyn phrases it, "The public had doubtless been misled by the old-style romanticism of the eighteenth Paganini variation and were perplexed to find that Rachmaninoff had after all advanced beyond the 1900s; the critics, on the other hand, condemned him just because they felt that he had not."&lt;ref name="Martyn, 343"&gt;Martyn, 343&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composer===
Rachmaninoff believed the Third Symphony was one of his best works, and its lukewarm reception disappointed and puzzled him. He summed up the situation in a 1937 letter to Vladimir Wilshaw: "It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But——sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far."&lt;ref name="Martyn, 343"/&gt;

==Composition==
===Inspiration===
Regarding the inspiration of the work and whether the symphony had a [[Program music|programmatic]] intent, Rouse has remained deliberately ambiguous.  In the program notes to the score, he commented:{{quote|For those of my scores in which I have had a reasonably specific expressive intent, I have usually tried to be open about the nature of that intent. However, there have been a few occasions when I have felt the need to say very little in this regard. [...] ...while I did have a particular meaning in mind when composing my Symphony No. 4, I prefer to keep it to myself. Some listeners may find the piece baffling but will nonetheless have to guess.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly twenty minutes and is composed in two movements:&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=A Work Is Rushed to a Debut, by Design: Christopher Rouse and EarShot Premieres From Philharmonic |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/arts/music/christopher-rouse-and-earshot-premieres-from-philharmonic.html |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the symphony, calling it "a short and engagingly strange piece that plunged without warning from dance to dolor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=Blockbuster: The New York Philharmonic puts on its first Biennial |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=June 23, 2014 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/blockbuster |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WQXR-FM]] called it "a grand gesture in symphonic writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rouse, Eötvös, Adolphe Premiered at NY Phil Biennial |work=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=June 29, 2014 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/on-demand-audio-rouse-eotvos-adolphe-premiered-ny-phil-biennial/ |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the piece as "an intriguing 20-minute work structured in two connected movements of vastly contrasting character: the first bustling and seemingly cheerful, the second grim and despairing."  Tommasini further commented:{{quote|The first movement of Mr. Rouse’s Symphony No. 4 is marked 'Felice,' and the music is indeed felicitous. There are bustling rhythmic figurations and whole passages built from ascending, sputtering scale motifs. After a while the cheerful energy becomes tiresome. Enough, already! What is he up to? The music becomes bogged down with intricacy, jagged phrases and weighty harmonies. The first movement seems to decompress, or deflate.

The second movement, marked 'Doloroso,' becomes ominous, which could have sounded melodramatic and obvious. But Mr. Rouse explores the dark side with restraint and mystery. The piece does not end so much as give up, in a final, enigmatic gesture.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;}}

'''"The Magician’s Tea-Party'''" is a fairytale written by British suffragist and author [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Evelyn. “The Magician’s Tea-Party.” The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Other Side of the Sun. Ebook 40573. The Project Gutenberg, August 2012. Web. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40573/40573-h/40573-h.htm#  (accessed February 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The story starts with little [[monarch|King]] Wistful, the eight-year-old king of the Cheerful Isles, or as he renamed them, the Monotonous Isles. The King slips through the gates to go look for something interesting because he finds that his kingdom is the “dullest and ugliest and the most wearisome place in the world.”

The King, now outside, surveys his kingdom, commenting on how stupid his kingdom is, and feeling sorry for himself, then he hears a voice.  The voice is from a little girl singing.  The little girl is singing for the little King Wistful to come and play.

::Sing-song! Don't be long!
::Wistful, Wistful, come and play!
::Sing-song! It's very wrong
::To stay and stay and stay away!
::The world is much too nice a place
::To make you pull so long a face;
::It's full of people being kind,
::And full of flowers for you to find;
::There's heaps of folks for you to tease
::And all the naughtiness you please;
::To sulk is surely waste of time
::When all those trees are yours to climb!
::Ting-a-ring! Make haste, King!
::I've something really nice to say;
::Ting-a-ring! A proper King
::Would not make me sing all day!

When the girl comes into sight the King notices that she has the “brightest brown eyes” that he had ever seen. The little girl introduces herself as Eyebright and when asked where she learned her song, she replies that the [[Magic (paranormal)|magician]] taught her and that she needed to sing it every day until the King came.

The two talk for a time and the King tells Eyebright about how stupid his kingdom is while Eyebright tries to change his mind about it.  Eyebright does not manage to change the little King's mind but does get him to follow her to go to see the Magician. The two children travel to the middle island, through woods and into a boat to get to the Magician’s cave.

The two enter the cave and Eyebright tells the Magician that she brought the King and that he must disenchant the King so that he can see what a wonderful kingdom he has. After shaking hands with the King the Magician invites them to sit with him for tea. The Magician performs some magic for a table and chairs to appear.  The King and Eyebright set the table and the three proceed to have a delightful tea-party.

After tea the children tell the Magician just why they came in the first place.  The Magician tells them that the reason that the King cannot see his kingdom for the wonderful place that it is, was because the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a baby.  The Magician explains why the wymps would do such a thing and tells them where they have to go to try to get the wymps to reverse what they did, Wympland, and how they were to get there.  The Magician then sends the children to Wympland on a flash of lightning.

The King and Eyebright, now in Wympland, look around and find a wymp to talk to.  They to talk with the wymp and the King tells him that the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a child.  The wymp reveals to them that there is only one thing to do; they must exchange eyes, only thing to be done.  The Wymp tells them how to exchange eyes and without hesitation Eyebright switches their eyes.  The King is unhappy about this as he did not want Eyebright to have to see things through his eyes but at this point he has little choice.

The King and Eyebright suddenly appear back home, looking over the kingdom.  The King can now see just how wonderful and beautiful his kingdom is.  Eyebright thought she could only see five round islands in a row, but the King cannot possibly be mistaken so she agrees that it is a beautiful kingdom.  Eyebright then runs off and the King returns home to bed.

The final lines tell of how there is now a Queen as well as a King of the Monotonous Isles.  This Queen always agrees with the King when he tells of how beautiful the kingdom is.  While this may be remarkable it needs to be remembered that “the Queen sees everything with the King's eyes.”&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Evelyn. “The Magician’s Tea-Party.” The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Other Side of the Sun.

== Author ==

The fairy tale “The Magician’s Tea-Party” was written by Evelyn Sharp as part of a set of fairy tales in her book ''The Other Side of the Sun''.
Evelyn Jane Sharp (1869-1955) was a children’s writer in England.  Evelyn was the ninth of eleven children, and the youngest of four girls.  Her sisters taught her until she was twelve, then she attended a school in London for three years, before attending the College de France in Paris

Evelyn Sharp wrote over twenty books and hundreds of short stories for children.  Her children’s stories are known for treating children as intelligent and creative rather than patronizing and moralistic.  Evelyn also wrote for several newspapers, she was the Manchester Guardians’ first regular women's page writer, she wrote for the Daily Herald for eight years, and wrote for the Daily Chronicle in the 1930s. She became a women’s suffragist in 1906, lecturing and writing towards the goal of women’s suffrage.

Evelyn continued in this manner, writing and various excursions. She then, after claiming she would be expected to settle down into spinsterhood in her autobiography, married her husband, Henry, on January 18, 1933. At this time Evelyn was a sixty-year-old woman and Henry was seventy-five.  The two had eight years together when Henry died in 1941.  Evelyn lived out her remaining years in London, where she died in a nursing home June 17, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V.. “Sharp , Evelyn Jane (1869–1955).” Angela V.

'''Theater''' has been performed in '''Yemen''' since the early years of the twentieth century. It is, as elsewhere, a public and social genre: performances take place in cultural centers, at universities, at schools and language institutes, in public parks and squares, as well as at more intimate gatherings, such as wedding celebrations. By the count of one scholar of Yemeni theater, a minimum of five hundred plays of all kinds have been performed in Yemen over the course of the last century, around three hundred and seventy of which are by Yemeni authors; there are also around one hundred published Yemeni play scripts.&lt;ref&gt; Sayf, Yahya Muhammad. ''Al-Mukhtasar al-mufid fi al-Masrah al-arabi al-jadid:  al-Masrah fi al-Yaman (A Useful Introduction to New Arabic Theater:  Theater in Yemen.'' Arab Theater Institute, Sharjah 2009, p. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these plays have taken uniquely Yemeni themes as their subject matter:  particular moments or celebrated figures from Yemeni history, like Bilqis, the legendary [[Queen of Sheba]]; the 1962 revolution against the [[Imams of Yemen#Modern History|Hamid al-Din Imamate]] in the North; or the 1967 revolution against the British colonial forces in the South. But Yemeni performances have also drawn upon other traditions, including Egyptian drama, like the works of [[Yusuf Idris]], [[Alfred Farag]], and [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]], and on texts by European playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Luigi Pirandello]]. Performances vary in type from [[tragedy]] to [[Improvisational Theater|improvised comedy]], from [[Musical theatre|musical]] to [[experimental theater]], from [[Naturalism (theater)|naturalistic plays]] to [[theater of the absurd]].

== History ==

According to Yemeni theater historian Sa'id Aulaqi, the first play publicly performed by Yemeni actors was Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', in Arabic translation, staged in the city of Aden in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;'Aulaqi, Sa'id. ''Saba'un 'Aaman Min al-Masrah fii al-Yaman (Seventy Years of Theater in Yemen'').  Aden:  Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 1983, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare proved popular with Yemeni audiences:  subsequent decades saw performances of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]], [[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''[[Othello]]''. &lt;ref&gt; al-Asmar, Husayn.  ''al-Masraḥ fī al-Yaman:  taǧribah wa ṭumūḥ (Theatre in Yemen:  Experience and Ambition)'', Al-Manār al-‘Arabī Press, Giza 1991, p. 71; Aulaqi, Chs. 3 and 5; and Hennessey, Katherine. “Shylock in the Hadhramaut? Adaptations of Shakespeare on the Yemeni Stage”, ''Arablit'' 3:5 (Summer 2013). &lt;/ref&gt;
But Yemeni playwrights and actors also created their own texts.  Some of these plays sought to criticize the British occupying forces in Aden and the surrounding area, and to call for independence.  Others were less overtly political—romantic comedies, or dramatizations of foundational events in Islamic history.  The first full-length comedy performed in Yemeni dialect, Masrur Mabruk’s ''Tarfisha and Shorban'', took place in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Sayf, Yahya Muhammad.  ''‘Ālam al-adab wa ’l-fann al-masraḥī fī al-Yaman (Great Names in the Literature and Art of the Theater in Yemen)'', al-Hay’ah al-‘āmah lil-kuttāb, Ṣan‘ā’ 2006, p. 71. Also ’Aulaqi, p. 46. &lt;/ref&gt;
Performances in the early decades of the 20th century often took place in public squares or in schools, since no theaters ''per se'' existed.  Only men acted, as in the Elizabethan era, and some became famous for interpreting female characters.  This remained the case until 1956, when Nabiha Azim became the first Yemeni woman to appear on stage.&lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, p. 80. &lt;/ref&gt;  It is also important to note that, in the first half of the 20th century, almost all performances occurred in the south of Yemen, most notably in Aden.  In the North, under the Imamate, theatrical performances were much rarer. 

The 1960s were a decade of revolution both North and South, and many Yemeni performances from these years took revolution as their theme, reflecting upon the military and political upheavals and the challenges of building new states and societies.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010, pp. 45-49.  Also Aulaqi, Ch. 10. &lt;/ref&gt; The governments of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and the [[South Yemen|People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (North and South Yemen respectively) demonstrated their interest in theater by establishing National Theater Troupes and supporting theater festivals. &lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, Ch. 11. &lt;/ref&gt;
Yemeni theater faced new challenges in the 1980s as a result of economic crises and political upheaval (war in  1979 between North and South Yemen, a civil war in the South in 1986). The celebrations that greeted the unification of North and South as the Republic of Yemen in 1990 were short-lived. Civil war broke out in 1994, amidst a background of economic hardship resulting from the expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia in the wake of the first [[Gulf War]].  Performances continued, however, both independently and under the auspices of the government, which sponsored important theater festivals in the 1990s that showcased the work of theater troupes from each of Yemen’s provinces.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010.  C.f. pp. 61-75 for an analysis of the 1990 festival, pp. 77-91 for the festival in 1993, and pp. 92-106 for the one in 1995. &lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen a resurgence of theater in Yemen, with foreign embassies, INGOs, and local organizations and institutes sponsoring theatrical productions. Among Yemen’s most notable contemporary actors and directors are ‘Amr Jamal and the Khalij Aden acting troupe, Amin Hazaber, Nargis ‘Abbad, Nabil Hizam, Ibrahim al-‘Ashmuri, and Saleh al-Saleh.  The [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu ''Global Shakespeares'' webpage], hosted by MIT, recently added its first-ever page featuring a Yemeni production,  [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/lamp-will-keep-you-company-hazaber-amin-2013/ a scene from ''Aismur Ma'ish al-Siraj,'' directed by Hazaber (2012, 2013)].

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds.

===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy.

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

'''Truth claim''', in photography, is a term [[Tom Gunning]] uses to describe the prevalent belief that traditional photographs accurately depict reality. He states that the truth claim relies on both the [[indexicality]] and visual accuracy of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexicality==
[[Charles Peirce]]'s term 'indexicality' refers to the physical relationship between the object photographed and the resulting image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Levinson]] emphasises the ability of photography to capture or reflect "a literal energy configuration from the real world" through a chemical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light sensitive emulsion on the [[Negative (photography)|photographic negative]] is transformed by light passing [[Through-the-lens|through the lens]] and diaphragm of a camera.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson relates this characteristic of the photograph to its objectivity and reliability, echoing Andre Bazin's belief that photography is free from the "sin" of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=40, 41, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument has been made for motion pictures by Stephen Maguire. [[Lev Manovich]] labels cinema ''the art of the index'', its traditional identity lying in its ability to capture reality.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lev Manovich |title=What is digital cinema? |url=http://www.manovich.net/text/digital-cinema |year=1995 |accessdate=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis McQuail]] likewise argues that film is capable of manipulating the "...seeming reality of the photographic message without loss of credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McQuail|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual accuracy==
Gunning states that a photograph must also have "iconicity". To represent "truth" it must resemble the object it represents, which is not an inevitable characteristic of an index.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

==Consequences of the "truth claim"==

===For individuals===
Levinson suggests that icons have a powerful effect on individuals, particularly the "direct image" due to the "sheer ease and [[sensual]] satisfaction" of viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=37, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning attributes the human fascination with photographs with a sense of the relationship between photography and reality, though he claims that the "perceptual richness and nearly infinite detail" of the image itself is more significant than a knowledge of its indexicality. He cites Bazin's idea that photography has an "irrational power to bear away our [[faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Susan Sontag]] relates the belief in a photograph's ability to capture 'reality' to the development of certain human practices. Since a picture confers on events "a kind of immortality (and importance) it would never otherwise have enjoyed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; she explains, the act of taking photographs has become essential to the experience of [[Travel|world travel]]. The possibility of 'true' photographs leads to a compulsion to "[convert] experience into an image" to "make real what one is experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For society===

====Understanding of reality====
David Croteau and William Hoynes suggest that the prevalence of photographic images has blurred the distinction between image and reality, referring to ''pseudo-events'', in Daniel Boorstin's words – such as [[News conference|press conferences]], televised political debates, or 'photo opportunities' - that exist only to create images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Neil Postman]] argues that the photograph has redefined society's understanding of information and truth: "Truth is in the seeing, not in the thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postman suggests that the proliferation of photography led to the replacement of language with images as "our dominant means for constructing, understanding, and testing reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Postman|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sontag shares this view, suggesting that "the 'realistic' view of the world compatible with bureaucracy redefines knowledge as ''techniques of information''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social organisation====
In Sontag's view, a consequence of photography becoming a primary means for understanding reality is the emergence of "[[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] cataloguing". She claims that photography's perceived ability to give information results in the bureaucratic organization of modern states. Institutions of control, such as the police, are able to survey and control "increasingly mobile populations" through photographic documents, such as passports or identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=5, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desensitization====
Sontag also argues that through repeatedly capturing and viewing reality through photographs, their subjects can become less real. She claims that "aesthetic distance seems built into the very experience of looking at photographs," and also that the sheer volume of horrific images throughout the world has produced a "familiarity with atrocity, making the horrible seem more ordinary – making it appear familiar, remote … inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyperreality====
Sontag's view is akin to Jean Baudrillard's theory of 'hyperreality', where "reality itself founders" as a result of an endless "reduplication of the real" via media such as photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the possibility of infinite identical objects creates a "relationship of equivalence, of indifference,"...leading to the "extinction of the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital photography==

It has been argued that the digitisation of photography undermines its ''truth claim''.

===Potential for manipulation===
Levinson suggests that the digitisation of photography undermines "the very reliability of the photograph as mute, unbiased witness of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the fallibility of [[photo manipulation|technological manipulation]] and the potential for human refinement of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lev Manovich likewise questions the indexical identity of motion pictures, rather labelling cinema a [[Genre|subgenre]] of painting, since it is possible to digitally modify frames, generate photorealistic images entirely using 3-D [[computer animation]], and "...to cut, bend, stretch and stitch digitised film images into something which has perfect photographic credibility, although it was never actually filmed."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

===Loss of indexicality===
It has also been argued that digital photographs inevitably lack indexicality, based on an understanding of "crucial distinctions between the analogue and the digital" in the way they record 'reality'.&lt;ref name="Lister_252"&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Frosh describes photographs as "codes without a message" – "repurposable visual content made of malleable info-pixels."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The continuing "reality effect"===
Gunning alternatively argues that [[digital photography]], the process of encoding data about light in a matrix of numbers, is indexically determined by objects outside of the camera like chemical photography.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Likewise, Martin Lister claims that even with a [[digital camera]], "The images produced are rendered [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]], they borrow photography's currency, its deeply historical 'reality effect', simply in order to have meaning."&lt;ref name="Lister_252"/&gt;

==Criticism of the "truth claim"==
[[Susan Sontag]] challenges the "presumption of veracity" associated with photographs, arguing that they are "...as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are." She describes the role of the photographer in determining the exposure, light, texture and geometry of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning points to the physicality of the camera as a mediator between the photograph and reality. He notes that the use of a lens, film, a particular exposure, kind of shutter, and developing process "...become magically whisked away if one considers the photograph as a direct imprint of reality."&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Sontag also describes the inability of a photograph to capture enough information about its subject to be considered a representation of reality. She states, "The camera's rendering of reality must always hide more than it discloses…only what which narrates can make us understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Roland Barthes]] notes that the [[Research subject|human subject]] can be made less real through the process of being photographed. He notes, "Once I feel myself observed by the lens, everything changes: I constitute myself in the process of 'posing', I instantaneously make another body for myself, transform myself in advance into an image."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthes|1982|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Porter|Kennedy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
