      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">'''Acceptable daily intake''' or '''ADI''' is a measure of the amount of a specific substance (originally applied for a [[food additive]], later also for a residue of a veterinary drug or pesticide) in [[food]] or [[drinking water]] that can be ingested (orally) on a daily basis over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk.&lt;ref name=WHO1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = WHO | title = Principles for the safety assessment of food additives and contaminants in food | journal = Environmental Health Criteria 70. | year = 1987 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc70.htm | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== History ==
This concept was first introduced in 1961 by the [[Council of Europe]] and later, the [[Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives]] (JECFA), a committee maintained by two United Nations bodies: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref name="Lu" /&gt;

== Concept ==
An ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans. First, a [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]] (NOAEL),&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-9691-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennema, Owen R. |title=Food chemistry |edition= |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=1996 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0Xx8-8_5EcC&amp;pg=PA828&amp;dq=%22Acceptable+Daily+Intake%22+%22No+Observable%22|page= 828}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined. Usually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses. In the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NOAEL is usually taken.  Then, the NOAEL (or another point of departure such as a benchmark dose level (BMDL)) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10).&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt; safety factors with values other than 100 may be used if information on uncertainty about the value of the point of departure (NOAEL or BMDL) justify it. For instance, if the ADI is based on data from humans the safety factor is usually 10 instead of 100. The ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight.&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-24865-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mackey, Maureen A. |author2=Kotsonis, Frank N. |title=Nutritional toxicology |edition= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-24865-5 |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SBiWo6_RCJ8C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22Acceptable+Daily+Intake%22+%22No+Observable%22#PPA258,M1|accessdate=|page= 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question. Increased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children and as children generally suffer higher illness rates than adults, adverse effects caused by food additives can easily be disguised as any number of things children usually suffer with. It would be far more difficult to argue the case with a healthy adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02652039809374612 |title=Toxicokinetics in infants and children in relation to the ADI and TDI |year=1998 |last1=Renwick |first1=A. G. |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=15 |pages=17–35 |pmid=9602909}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADI does not take into account allergic reactions that are individual responses rather than dose-dependent phenomena.

The higher the ADI, the larger amounts of a compound are safe for regular ingestion. The concept of [[tolerable daily intake]] is often used for unwanted contaminants or other chemicals.

The ADI concept can be understood as a measure to indicate the toxicity from long-term exposure  to repeated ingestion of chemical compounds in foods (present and/or added), as opposed to acute toxicity.

The [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

'''Architectural Engineering''', also known as '''Building Engineering''' or '''Architecture Engineering''', is the application of [[engineering]] principles and [[technology]] to [[building design]] and [[construction]]. Definitions of an '''architectural engineer''' may refer to:
* An engineer in the [[structural engineering|structural]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A [[Professional engineer|licensed engineering professional]] in parts of the [[United States]].
*Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

==Engineering for designer==

===Structural engineering===

{{Main|Structural engineering}}
Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment (buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls). Those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as "building engineers". Structural engineers require expertise in [[strength of materials]], [[structural analysis]], and in predicting [[structural load]] such as from weight of the building, occupants and contents, and extreme events such as wind, rain, ice, and [[seismic design]] of structures which is referred to as [[earthquake engineering]]. Architectural Engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs; the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists.

===Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP)===
{{Main|Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing}}
[[File:MEP Room Virginia Tech.JPG|thumb|right|200px|MEP room in a building]]

[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as ([[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]) when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as "[[building services engineering]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.cibse.org/Building-Services/What-s-so-special-about-Building-Services-Engineer/Building-Services-Engineers-Bring-Buildings-to-Lif|website =  Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers|title = Building Services Engineers Bring Buildings to Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC), [[plumbing]] and [[rain gutter]] systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple [[active fire protection]] systems, but for more complicated projects, [[fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]] are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's [[power distribution]], [[telecommunication]], [[fire alarm]], signalization, [[lightning protection]] and [[control systems]], as well as [[Architectural lighting design|lighting systems]].

==The architectural engineer (PE) in the United States==
{{Main|Architectural engineer (PE)}}
In many jurisdictions of the United States, the architectural engineer is a [[Professional engineer|licensed]] engineering professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |title=Licensure |publisher=NCEES |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams; or for practice in one of structural, mechanical or electrical fields of building design, but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements. 

Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century.  With the establishment of a specific "architectural engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States. 

In most license-regulated jurisdictions, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects, and may be restricted from the practice of structural engineering on specific types of higher importance buildings such as hospitals.  Regulations and customary practice vary widely by region or city.

==The architect as architectural engineer{{anchor|Architect}}==
{{See also|Architect#Professional requirements}}
In some countries, the practice of architecture includes planning, designing and overseeing the building's construction, and architecture, as a [[profession]] providing [[architect#Architects in practice|architectural services]], is referred to as "architectural engineering". In Japan, a "first-class architect" plays the dual role of architect and building engineer, although the services of a licensed "structural design first-class architect" are required for buildings over a certain scale.&lt;ref name=JapanInfoCenter&gt;{{cite web|title=Architects / Building Engineers in Japan|url=http://www.jaeic.or.jp/k-pamphlet_e20130507.pdf|publisher=The Japan Architectural Education and Information Center|accessdate=2014-08-16|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], "architect" is literally translated as "architectural engineer". In some countries, an "architectural engineer" (such as the ''ingegnere edile'' in Italy) is entitled to practice [[architecture]] and is often referred to as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectplan.download/ Architecture Plan (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} These individuals are often also structural engineers. In other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iran, and most of the Arab countries, architecture graduates receive an engineering degree (''Dipl.-Ing. – Diplom-Ingenieur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx German Chamber of Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427191023/http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx |date=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, an "architect" has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1999-21567 "Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación" (Building Management Act)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process (Conselho Federal de Engenheiros, Arquitetos e Agrônomos (CONFEA) – Federal Council of Engineering, Architecture and Agronomy). Now the Brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process (CAU – Architecture and Urbanism Council). Besides traditional architecture design training, Brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural, electrical, hydraulic and mechanical engineering. After graduation, architects focus in architectural planning, yet they can be responsible to the whole building, when it concerns to small buildings (except in electric wiring, where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kVA, and it has to be done by an Electrical Engineer), applied to buildings, urban environment, built cultural heritage, landscape planning, interiorscape planning and regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 Resolução 1010/05 – Conselho Federal de Engenharia, Arquitetura e Urbanismo – CONFEA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515160635/http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 |date=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2007-2010/2010/Lei/L12378.htm LEI nº 12.378, de 2010 – Presidência da República]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the Polytechnic University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polytechnic (Greece)]]&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining an "Engineering Diploma". They graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE – Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.tee.gr/ Technical Chamber of Greece (Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος)&lt;!-- Bot generated title (+ human editing) --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role |title=Role &amp; Objectives |publisher=Technical Chamber of Greece |archivedate=2011-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814025131/http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Technical Chamber of Greece has more than 100,000 members encompassing all the engineering disciplines as well as architecture.
A prerequisite for being a member is to be licensed as a qualified engineer or architect and to be a graduate of an engineering and architecture schools of a Greek university, or of an equivalent school from abroad.
The Technical Chamber of Greece is the authorized body to provide work licenses to engineers of all disciplines as well as architects, graduated in Greece or abroad. The license is awarded after examinations. The examinations take place three to four times a year. The Engineering Diploma equals a master's degree in ECTS units (300) according to the Bologna Accords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Further|Engineer's degree}}
The architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program.
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|225px|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend). Bringing together knowledge of [[acoustic engineering]] and [[HVAC]] is one example of the multi-disciplined nature of architectural engineering]]

===Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study===
{{Main|Building engineering education}}

What differentiates architectural engineering from architecture (architect) as a separate and single, integrated field of study, compared to other engineering disciplines, is its multi-disciplinary engineering approach. Through training in and appreciation of architecture, the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design. Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)]], plumbing, [[fire protection]], [[electrical]], [[lighting]], [[architectural acoustics]], and structural systems. In some university programs, students are required to concentrate on one of the systems; in others, they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">{{about|the linguistic term||Bongo Bongo Land}}
'''Bongo-Bongo''' in [[linguistics]] is used as a name for an [[imaginary language]]. It is most commonly invoked in [[Etymology|etymological studies]] to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a name for a [[constructed language]] invented by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] as a teaching tool in linguistics.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;Murray, N. ''Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates'' [[Cambridge University Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|978-0521128469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological studies==
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term ''Bongo-Bongo approach'' or ''Bongo-Bongo effect''.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; For example, when comparing random [[Underlying representation|surface forms]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as ''hegi'' (Basque for "ridge") and ''hegy'' (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Anthropology==
The concept can also be found occasionally in [[anthropology]] where the ''Bongo-Bongo'' are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, [[Bongo Bongo Land]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kippenberg, HG (ed) ''Concepts of Person in Religion and Thought (Religion and Reason, No 37)'' [[Walter de Gruyter|de Gruyter]] (1990) {{ISBN|978-3110121599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The road to the CLS: 1972–1999===
[[Image:CSRF Grasshopper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[monochromator]] from the first CSRF beamline, now a museum piece at the CLS]]
[[Image:SAL LINAC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The SAL LINAC, seen at the CLS in 2011]]

Canadian interest in [[synchrotron radiation]] dates from 1972, when Bill McGowan of the [[University of Western Ontario]] (UWO) organised a workshop on its uses. At that time there were no users of synchrotron radiation in Canada. In 1973 McGowan submitted an unsuccessful proposal to the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC) for a feasibility study on a possible synchrotron lightsource in Canada. In 1975 a proposal to build a dedicated synchrotron lightsource in Canada was submitted to NRC. This was also unsuccessful. In 1977 [[G. Michael Bancroft|Mike Bancroft]], also of UWO, submitted a proposal to NRC to build a Canadian [[beamline]], as the [[Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (CSRF), at the existing [[Synchrotron Radiation Center]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], USA, and in 1978 newly created [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]] awarded capital funding. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998.

A further push towards a Canadian synchrotron light source started in 1990 with formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR), initiated by Bruce Bigham of [[AECL]]. AECL and [[TRIUMF]] showed interest in designing the ring, but the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]] (SAL) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] became prominent in the design. In 1991 CISR submitted a proposal to NSERC for a final design study.  This was turned down, but in later years, under President Peter Morand, NSERC became more supportive. In 1994 NSERC committee recommended a Canadian synchrotron light source and a further NSERC committee was formed to select between two bids to host such a facility, from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Western Ontario. In 1996 this committee recommended that the Canadian Light Source be built in Saskatchewan.

With NSERC unable to supply the required funds it was not clear where funding would come from. In 1997 the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) was created to fund large scientific projects, possibly to provide a mechanism to fund the CLS. In 1998 a University of Saskatchewan team led by [http://awards.usask.ca/faculty/recipients/skopik.php Dennis Skopik], the SAL director, submitted a proposal to CFI.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to fund 40% of the construction costs, with remaining money having to come from elsewhere. Assembling these required matching funds has been called "an unprecedented level of collaboration among governments, universities, and industry in Canada"&lt;ref name="SPHistory"&gt;[http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/Canadian_Light_Source.html "Synchrotron: Canadian Light Source 70 years in the making'"],''The Star-Phoenix'' 20 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Bancroft – leader of the rival UWO bid – anckowledged the "Herculean" efforts of the Saskatchewan team in obtaining funds from the University, the City of Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan Power]], NRC, the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, and [[Western Economic Diversification]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; At a late hour CFI told the proponents that it would not accept the SAL [[LINAC]] as part of the proposal, and the resulting shortfall was met in part by the spontaneous announcement by the Saskatoon city council and then Mayor [[Henry Dayday]] that they would double their contribution as long as other partners would. On 31 March 1999 the success of the CFI proposal was announced.

The following month Skopik took a position at [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] in the USA. He decided not to stay on as director of the Saskatoon facility because his expertise was in subatomic particles, and, he argued, the head of the CLS should be a researcher who specializes in using such a facility. His successor was Mike Bancroft&lt;ref name="SPHistory" /&gt;

===Construction: 1999–2004===

At the start of the project, all staff members with the former SAL were transferred into a new [[nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] corporation, Canadian
Light Source Inc., CLSI, which had primary responsibility for the technical design, construction and operation of the facility. As a separate corporation from the University, CLSI had the legal and organizational freedom suitable for this responsibility. UMA, an experienced engineering firm, now part of [[AECOM]], with extensive experience managing large technical and civil construction projects, was hired as [[project management|project managers]].&lt;ref name="CLSI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/weilh04.pdf|title=Industrial involvement in the construction of synchrotron lightsources| year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new building – attached to the existing SAL building, and measuring 84m by 83m in area with a maximum height of 23m – was completed in early 2001.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; The footprint of the CLS has been described as equivalent to that of a football field.&lt;ref name="Reinvent" /&gt;

Bancroft's appointment ended in October 2001 and he returned to UWO, with Mark de Jong appointed acting director. Bancroft remained as acting Scientific Director until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsource.ca/enews/newsletter_October2001.php CLS Newsletter October 2001 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the CLS Project was awarded the National Award for Exceptional Engineering Achievement by the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Engaward"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/synchrotronaward.php| title=U of S-Owned Synchrotron Project Wins National Engineering Award  | date=27 May 2002| accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAL LINAC was refurbished and placed back into service in 2002 while the booster and storage rings were still under construction.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; First turn was achieved in the booster ring in July 2002 with full booster commissioning completed by September 2002.&lt;ref name="booster"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF025.PDF |title=Commissioning report of the CLS booster synchrotron | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New director Bill Thomlinson, an expert in synchrotron medical imaging, arrived in November 2002. He was recruited from the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] where he had been the head of the medical research group.&lt;ref name="Thom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/02-aug-09/news17.shtml | title=Thomlinson to head CLS Nov. 1| date=9 August 2002 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 proposal to NSERC envisioned a 1.5 GeV storage ring, since at this time the interest of the user community was mainly in the soft X-ray range. The ring was a racetrack layout of four to six [[dipole magnet|bend]] regions surrounding straights with extra [[quadrupole magnets|quadrupoles]] to allow for variable functions in the straights. The design contemplated the use of [[superconductivity|superconducting]] bends in some locations to boost
the [[photon]] energies produced. The drawback of this design was the limited number of straight sections. In 1994 a more conventional machine with 8 straight sections was proposed, again with 1.5 GeV energy. At this time more users of hard X-rays were interested and it was felt that both the energy and number of straight sections were too low. By the time funding was secured in 1999 the design had changed to 2.9 GeV, with longer straight sections to enable two [[insertion devices]] per straight, delivering beam to two independent beamlines.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/p03/PAPERS/TOPA001.PDF| title=The Canadian Light Source | year=2003 | format=PDF | accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the storage ring was completed in August 2003 and commissioning began the following month. Although beam could be stored, in March 2004 a large obstruction was found across the center of the chamber. Commissioning proceeded quickly after this was removed, and by June 2004 currents of 100mA could be achieved .&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/Accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF007.PDF | title=Canadian Light Source status and commissioning results | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2004 the CLS officially opened, with an opening ceremony attended by federal and provincial dignitaries, including then-Federal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] [[Ralph Goodale]] and then-[[Premier of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Premier]] [[Lorne Calvert]], university presidents and leading scientists. October 2004 was declared "Synchrotron Month" by the city of Saskatoon and the Saskatchewan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-sep-24/news07.shtml|title= October declared Synchrotron Month |date=24 September 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Mansbridge]] broadcast the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s nightly [[newscast]] [[The National (CBC)|''The National'']] from the top of the storage ring the day before the official opening.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-nov-05/news01.shtml| title=Dignitaries gather to mark synchrotron's grand opening| date=5 November 2004| accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Lynne Yelich]] said "There were many challenges to overcome, but thanks to the vision, dedication and persistence of its supporters, the Canadian Light Source synchrotron is open for business in Saskatoon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://openparliament.ca/debates/2004/10/21/lynne-yelich-1/only/|title= Lynne Yelich on Canadian Light Source |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation and expansion: 2005–2012===
[[Image:CLS in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The CLS building in 2008, with the expansion for the BMIT beamline on the left]]
[[Image:Brockhouse construction.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The expansion for the Brockhouse beamlines under construction in July 2012]]
The initial funding included seven beamlines, referred to as Phase I, which covered the full spectral range: two [[infrared]] beamlines, three soft X-ray beamlines and two hard X-ray beamlines.&lt;ref name="Bancroft" /&gt; Further beamlines were built in two further phases, II (7 beamlines) and III (5 beamlines), announced in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Most of these were funded through applications to CFI by individual universities including UWO, the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Guelph University]]&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

In March 2005 leading infrared researcher Tom Ellis joined the CLS from [[Acadia University]] as Director of Research. He had previously spent 16 years at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |title=Leading Scientist Recruited as Research Director for Canadian Light Source at the U of S |date=1 March 2005 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409000406/http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |archivedate=9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first external user was hosted in 2005, and the first research papers with results from the CLS were published in March 2006 – one from the University of Saskatchewan on [[peptide]]s and the other from the University of Western Ontario on materials for [[OLED|organic light-emitting diodes]].&lt;ref name="Flow"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad| title=Research results begin to flow from synchrotron| date=18 April 2006| accessdate=27 July 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625091033/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad#| archive-date=25 June 2014| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was set up in 2006 to [[peer review]] proposals for beamtime, under the chairmanship of Adam Hitchcock of [[McMaster University]].

By the end of 2010 more than 1000 individual researchers had used the facility, and the number of publications had passed 500.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC" /&gt;
From 2009–2012 several key metrics doubled, including the number of users and the number of publications, with more than 190 papers published in 2011. More than 400 proposals were received for beam time in 2012, with approximately a 50% oversubscription rate averaged over the operational beamlines. By 2012 the user community spanned all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt; That year a high school group from [[La Loche]] Saskatchewan became the first to use the purpose built educational beamline IDEAS.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt; Also in 2012 the CLS signed an agreement with the [[Advanced Photon Source]] synchrotron in the USA to allow Canadian researchers access to their facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aps.anl.gov/News/APS_News/Content/APS_NEWS_20120618.php

An international team led by [[University of Calgary]] professor Ken Ng solved the detailed structure of [[RNA polymerase]] using X-ray crystallography at the CLS. This enzyme replicates itself as the [[Norwalk virus]] spreads through the body, and has been linked to other [[supervirus]]es such as [[hepatitis C]], [[West Nile virus]] and the [[common cold]]. Its duplication is responsible for the onset of such viruses.&lt;ref name="Norwalk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=865bf07a-f32f-4a35-b970-ed3f26068e72 |title=U of C researcher cracks Norwalk code |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625091024/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=865bf07a-f32f-4a35-b970-ed3f26068e72# |archive-date=25 June 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLS scientist Luca Quaroni and University of Saskatchewan professor Alan Casson used infrared microscopy to identify [[biomarker]]s inside individual cells from tissue associated with [[Barrett's esophagus]]. This disease can lead to an aggressive form of cancer known as [[esophageal adenocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news163563060.html|title=Researchers Shed Light on Esophageal Disease| date= 8 June 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from [[Lakehead University]] and the University of Saskatchewan used the CLS to investigate the deaths of [[Royal Navy]] sailors buried in [[Antigua]] in the late 1700s. They used X-ray fluorescence to look for trace elements such as lead and [[strontium]] in bones from a recently [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] naval cemetery&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovationanthology.com/news.php?id=782|title=Synchrotron reveals tales told by old bones| date= 30 April 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists from [[Stanford University]] worked with CLS scientists to design a cleaner, faster [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The new battery charges in less than two minutes, thanks to a newly developed [[carbon]] [[nanostructure]]. The team grew [[nanocrystal]]s of iron and nickel on carbon. Traditional batteries lack this structure, mixing iron and nickel with conductors more or less randomly. The result was a strong chemical bond between the materials, which the team identified and studied at the synchrotron.&lt;ref name="Battery"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-cleaner-faster-battery.html|title=A cleaner, faster battery| date= 9 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team led by the [[Politecnico di Milano]], including scientists from the [[University of Waterloo]] and the University of British Columbia, found the first experimental evidence that a [[charge density wave]] instability competes with superconductivity in [[high-temperature superconductors]]. They used four synchrotrons including the REIXS beamline at CLS.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20120712.php|title=Synchrotrons help bring superconductors out of the cold| date= 13 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the X-ray spectromicroscopy beamline, a research team led by scientists from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York, Buffalo]] produced images of [[graphene]] showing how folds and ripples act as [[speed bump]]s for electrons, affecting its [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]].

From inception, the CLS showed a "strong commitment to industrial users and private/public partnerships",{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} with then-director Bancroft reporting "more than 40 letters of support from industry indicating that [the CLS] is important for what they do".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=167}} This commitment has been criticised, notably by University of Saskatchewan professor Howard Woodhouse, since only two private companies provided capital funding, with the rest coming from public funds,{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} while up to 25% of beamline time at CLS is allocated to commercial use.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}}&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; The CLS has an industrial group, within the larger experimental facilities division, with industrial liaison scientists who make synchrotron techniques available to a "non-traditional" user base who are not synchrotron experts. By 2007 more than 60 projects had been carried out,&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; although in a speech in the same year, then-CLS director Bill Thomlinson said that "one of the biggest challenges for the synchrotron...is to get private users through the door", with less than 10% of time actually used by industry.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=170}} 
 
In 1999 then-Saskatoon mayor Dayday stated that "the CLS will add $122 million to Canada's GDP during construction and $12 million annually after that".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=163}} An [[economic impact analysis|economic impact study]] of the two [[financial year]]s 2009/10 and 10/11 showed the CLS had added $45 million per year to the Canadian GDP, or about $3 for every $1 of operating funding.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20111122.php |title=Canadian Light Source making positive economic, scientific impacts for Canada |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CLS has been cited as an example of the commercialization of university research endangering "other areas of scholarship and research that is perceived to be of little immediate utility for generating private monetary wealth".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=8}} The CLS itself has stated that "the primary means of accessing the CLS is through a system of peer review, which ensures that the proposed science is of the highest quality and permits access to the facility to any interested researcher, regardless of regional, national, academic, industrial or governmental affiliation."&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

==Official Visitors==

==Medical Isotope Project==

With the [[National Research Universal reactor|NRU]] reactor at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] due to close in 2016, there was a need to find alternative sources of the medical isotope [[technetium-99m]], a mainstay of [[nuclear medicine]]. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron [[LINAC]] to produce [[molybdenum-99]], the parent isotope of technetium-99.&lt;ref name="CBCisotopes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/01/24/sk-synchrotron-isotopes-1101.html |title=Sask. Synchrotron to make medical isotopes |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this project a 35MeV LINAC has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for [[photodisintegration|photonuclear]] experiments with the SAL LINAC. First [[irradiation]]s are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the [[Winnipeg]] [[Health Sciences Centre (Winnipeg)|Health Sciences Centre]].&lt;ref name="isotope2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2012/papers/thxa01.pdf|title=Producing medical isotopes using X-rays| year=2012 | format=PDF | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education program==
[[Image:Students on the beamline.jpg|thumb|left|250px|High school students from La Loche at the Canadian Light Source]]
The CLS has an education program – "Students on the Beamlines" – funded by NSERC Promoscience. This outreach program for science allows high school students to fully experience the work of a scientist, in addition to having the chance to use the CLS beamlines.

"The program allows students the development of active research, a very rare phenomena in schools and provides direct access to the use of a particle accelerator, something even rarer!" said teacher Steve Desfosses form College Saint-Bernard, [[Drummondville]], Quebec.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;[http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1 "Le synchrotron de Saskatoon mis à la portée de jeunes scientifiques du Collège Saint-Bernard"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130115150408/http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1# |date=15 January 2013 }},''L'Express'' 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Dene]] students from La Loche, Saskatchewan have taken part in this program twice, looking at effects of [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name="Dene"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/spotlight_northern_exposure.php| title=Northern Exposure: Students from Saskatchewan's North do synchrotron science | date=October 2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student Jontae DesRoches commented "Elders have noticed that the landscape, where trees used to grow, there's none growing anymore. They're pretty concerned because wildlife is disappearing. Like, here there used to be rabbits and now there's none".&lt;ref name="ammsa"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ammsa.com/publications/saskatchewan-sage/experiment-teaches-students-hands-chemistry-curriculum| title=Experiment teaches students hands-on chemistry curriculum | year=2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 three student groups were at the CLS simultaneously, with the La Loche students as the first to use the IDEAS beamline.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt;

"The aim for the students," according to CLS education and outreach coordinator Tracy Walker, "is to get an authentic scientific inquiry that's different from the examples in textbooks that have been done thousands of times."&lt;ref name="CFIschool"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovation.ca/node/5116 | title=Particle accelerating ... in high school | date=10 March 2010| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from six [[Canadian province|provinces]] as well as the [[Northwest Territories]] have been directly involved in experiments, some of which have yielded publishable-quality research.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt;

In 2012 the CLS was awarded the [[Canadian Nuclear Society]]'s Education and Communication Award "in recognition of its commitment to community outreach, increasing public awareness of synchrotron science, and developing innovative and outstanding secondary educational programs such as Students on the Beamlines".&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Technical description==

===Accelerators===
[[Image:CLS synchrotron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The booster and storage rings inside the experimental hall]]
[[Image:Chicaned Undulators.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chicaned undulators inside the storage ring]]

====Injection system====

The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line.&lt;ref name="Injection"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf| title=Injection system for the Canadian Light Source | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LINAC was operated for over 30 years as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab&lt;ref name="update 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf|title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates at 2856&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, with an RF frequency of 500&amp;nbsp;MHz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.&lt;ref name="Injection"/&gt;

====Storage Ring====

The storage ring cell structure has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, [[microwave cavity|RF cavities]] and 9 sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As well as the two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of [[sextupole magnet]]s. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m.&lt;ref name="PAC2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF | title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032624/http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF# | archive-date=2 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal [[beam emittance]] of 18.2&amp;nbsp;nm-rad.&lt;ref name="Newest" /&gt;  The CLS was also one of the first facilities to [[chicane]] two [[undulator]]s in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt;

All five of the phase I X-ray beamlines use insertion devices. Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS, including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting [[wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] built by the [[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt; Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting wiggler, for the BMIT beamline.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/operations/insertion_devices.php|title=Insertion devices| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase III will add four more devices, filling 8 of the 9 available straight sections. Longer term development includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.&lt;ref name="IDdev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC10/papers/wepd005.pdf|title=Insertion Device Development at the Canadian Light Source| year=2010 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ring operates at a fill current of 250mA with two injections per day.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC"/&gt; Facility status is shown on a "machine status" [http://mstatus.lightsource.ca/ webpage], and using the [https://twitter.com/clsfc CLSFC] account on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Gems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |title=Three useful Twitter case studies |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613182326/http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |archivedate=13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superconducting RF Cavity ====
The CLS was the first light source to use a [[wikipedia:Superconducting radio frequency|superconducting RF (SRF) cavity]] in the storage ring from the beginning of operations.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate" /&gt; The [[niobium]] cavity is based on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz design used at the [[Cornell Electron Storage Ring]] (CESR) which allows potentially beam-perturbing high order modes to propagate out of the cavity where they can be very effectively damped.&lt;ref name="PAC2001" /&gt;  The superconducting nature of the niobium cavity means only 0.02% of the RF power put into the cavity is wasted in heating the cavity as compared to roughly 40% for normal-conducting (copper) cavities.  However, a large portion of this power saving - about 160&amp;nbsp;kW out of the 250&amp;nbsp;kW saved - is needed to power the cryogenic plant required to supply liquid helium to the cavity.  The SRF cavity at CLS is fed with RF from a 310&amp;nbsp;kW Thales klystron.

The '''Centre Nacional d'Anàlisi Genòmica''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), '''Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), or simply '''CNAG''', is a genome analysis center in [[Barcelona]] that carries out large-scale projects in collaboration with researchers from Catalonia, Spain and the International research community. It has a park of 13 last-generation sequencing systems supported by an outstanding computing infrastructure of 2.6 petabytes of data storage and over 1200 cores of computing, which has enabled the center to build a sequencing capacity of over 800 Gbases/day, the equivalent of completely sequencing eight human genomes every 24 hours. This capacity positions the CNAG as one of the top European centers in terms of sequencing capacity.

It is a non-profit organization funded in 2009 by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the Catalan Government through the Economy and Knowledge Department and the Health Department. It is located in the [[Parc Científic de Barcelona]] (PCB) that is one of the largest research clusters in Life Science in Southern Europe.

The CNAG takes part in large-scale sequencing projects in areas as diverse as cancer genomics, rare disease gene identification, infectious disease genomics, genomics of model organisms, agrogenomics, epigenomics, modeling of the nucleus, comparative genomics and single cell analysis. New laboratory methods, new sequencing methods and data analytical procedures implemented and developed continuously. 

The CNAG is certified Illumina CS Pro – Certified Provider and Agilent Exome Sequencing Certified Provider.

Since July 2015 its management was transferred to the [[Centre for Genomic Regulation]], becoming an outstation of the latter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aldia.cat/gent/noticia-centre-nacional-danalisi-genomic-sintegra-crg-barcelona-20150701183948.html|title=El Centre Nacional d'Anàlisi Genòmic s'integra al CRG de Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2015-07-01|work=aldia.cat|access-date=2017-05-24|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/AppJava/notapremsavw/285730/ca/acords-govern.do|title=Altres acords del Govern - Sala de premsa.

The '''Collegio Carlo Alberto''' is a private research and teaching institution, located in the city of [[Turin]], northern Italy, in the [[province of Turin]]. The institution was created in 2004 as a joint initiative of the [[:it:Compagnia di San Paolo|Compagnia di San Paolo]] and the [[University of Turin]], at first located in [[Moncalieri]]. Its mission is to foster research and education in social sciences. President of the Collegio is Pietro Terna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/collegio/about-us/governance/ Governance] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio's research community consists of full-time junior and senior faculty hired on the international academic job market, faculty of the University of Turin, and visiting scholars. They conduct research within the social sciences with both empirical and theoretical emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/research/ Research] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research interactions are fostered by seminar series and scientific conferences. Since 2006 the Collegio has hosted hundreds of international speakers, including Nobel laureates, and leaders of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/events/overview/ Events] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio coordinates the ''Allievi'' Honors Program, organizes five one-year master's degree programs (Economics, Economics and Complexity, Finance, Insurance and Risk Management, Public Policy and Social Change), and hosts two doctoral programs of the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/education/ Education] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
English is the official operating language of the Collegio.

Historically, prior to the 1990s, the ''Collegio Carlo Alberto'' referred to a [[Piedmont]] boys boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realcollegio.carloalberto.org/ History of Real Collego Carlo Alberto] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The school has since closed, but the building retains its name.

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The decriminalization of sex work''' is the removal of criminal penalties for [[sex work]].&lt;ref name="All Women"&gt;{{cite web |title=All Women, All Rights: Sex Workers Included |url=http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/All_Women_Alll_Rights_Sex_Workers_Included_Report.pdf |publisher=Center for Health and Gender Equity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, sex work, the consensual provision of sexual services for money or goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Overs|first1=Cheryl|title=Sex Workers: Part of the Solution|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/115solution.pdf|website=World Health Organization |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is criminalized. It is claimed that removing criminal prosecution for sex workers creates a safer and healthier environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Aziza|title=Feminism, power, and sex work in the context of HIV/Aids: consequences for women's health |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol341/225-258.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender|date=1 January 2011|volume=34|issue=1|page=225 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows them to live with less social exclusion and stigma.

===Prohibitionism===
All aspects of prostitution are criminalised. Often the sex trade is seen as a violation of human dignity, moral or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – which stance to take?|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11596&amp;Lang=EN|website=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also known as "Criminalization".)&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt;

===Abolitionism===
Whilst prostitution itself is legal, 3rd party involvement is generally prohibited. Solicit ion is also often prohibited. Whilst this model recognises prostitutes may chose work in the trade, it is morally wrong. Laws are designed to stop prostitution affecting the public.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[England]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

===Neo-abolitionism===
Neo-abolitionists believe there is no free choice for people entering prostitution, it violates their human rights and that prostitution is the sale and consumption of human bodies. Whilst prostitutes themselves commit no crime, clients and any third party involvement is criminalised.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (Also called the "Swedish model" or "Nordic model".)&lt;ref name="catwa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lse" /&gt;

===Legalization===
Whilst prostitution is not prohibited, there is legislation to control and regulate it.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The extent and type of control varies from country to country and may be regulated by work permits, licensing or tolerance zones.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. The [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (also called "regulationist".)&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

===Decriminalization===
Decriminalization is the removal of criminal penalties for sex work, and sex workers receive equal protection and recognition as workers in other industries.&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt; e.g. [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==Negative effects of criminalization==

===Health===
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), sex workers are considered one of the key populations at risk for [[HIV]] infection,&lt;ref name="Sex work"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex work|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/sex_work/about/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sex workers who inject drugs are at even more risk due to unprotected sex, syringe sharing, alcohol or drug dependence, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61042-4/abstract |last1=Rusakova|first1=Maia|author2=Aliya Rakhmetova|author3=[[Steffanie A. Strathdee]]|title=Why are sex workers who use substances at risk for HIV|journal=The Lancet|date=17 January 2015|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=211–212 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61042-4|pmid=25059944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigma, poverty, and exclusion from legal social services have increased their vulnerability to HIV infection.&lt;ref name="Sex work"/&gt;  Health risks and transmission of HIV as well as other [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) are increased in incidences where condom usage and accessibility is limited or used to identify and criminalize sex workers.  Many sex workers are managed by 'gatekeepers' who may be brothel owners, clients, or law enforcement figures, who often dictate condom usage.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.who.int/gender/documents/sexworkers.pdf |last=World Health Organization|title=Violence against sex workers and HIV prevention|journal=Information Bulletin Series|series=3 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia, a survey showed that 30% of sex workers who refused to put on condoms were sexually coerced. Fear of law enforcement and incarceration also discourages possession of condoms since they provide evidence for officers to prosecute and arrest.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"/&gt; Evidence suggests that HIV risk can be sharply reduced when sex workers are able to negotiate safer sex.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt; Decriminalization of sex work decreases the risk of HIV infection by breaking down stigma  and increasing access to health services, reducing the risk of HIV/AIDS and STIs.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt;

===Discrimination and stigma===

Sex workers experience significant stigma and discrimination as a result of criminalization.&lt;ref name="To Live Freely in This World"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mgabko|first1=Chi Adanna|title=To Live Freely in This World|date=January 2016|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781479849062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they consider sex work a legitimate income-generating activity, sex workers are viewed as immoral, deserving of punishment, and thus excluded from healthcare, education, and housing.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="To Live Freely in This World"/&gt; Criminalization laws exclude sex workers from health systems that provide access to preventative care such as condoms and regular HIV or STI testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic update and health sector progress towards Universal Access|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/progress_report2011/en/|publisher=World Health Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights abuses===
Sex workers, as a population that suffers disproportionately from HIV/AIDS, are often denied many human rights such as the right to freedom from discrimination, equality before the law, the right to life, and the right to the highest attainable standard of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right to Health|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203205100/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2016 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International publishes policy and research on protection of sex workers' rights|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in more than 11 countries by [http://swannet.org Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network] (SWAN) concluded that more than 200 sex workers have experienced violence and discrimination.&lt;ref name=Violence&gt;{{cite book|last=Crago|first=Anna-Louise|title=Arrest the Violence|year=2009|publisher=Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts of violence toward sex workers often include abuse, rape, kidnappings, and sexual violence. Sex workers also face extortion and unlawful arrests and detention, which profoundly impact their mental, physical, and social wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scorgie|first1=Fiona|author2=Katie Vasey|author3=Eric Harper|author4=Marlise Richter|author5=Prince Nare|author6=Sian Maseko|author7=Matthew F Chersich|title=Human rights abuses and collective resilience among sex workers in four African countries: a qualitative study|journal=Globalization and Health|date=2013|volume=9|issue=33|pages=1–13 |deadurl=no |doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-9-33|pmid = 23889941|pmc=3750273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for sex workers to seek criminal justice when it is reported that many police officers are partaking in the sexual and violent abuse.  In Macedonia, police violence towards sex workers is particularly high: 82.4 percent of sex workers were assaulted by police in 2007.&lt;ref name="Violence"/&gt; Criminalization laws such as bans on buying, solicitation, and the general organization of sex work perpetuate an unsafe environment for sex workers, provide impunity for abusers, and prevent sex workers from reporting crime to the police.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

==Decriminalization and criminalization==
{{main article|Prostitution by region}}

===Canada===
Canada's prostitution law was challenged in 2012 by Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch, and Valerie Scott in the [[Bedford v. Canada]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexworklawreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/canada_vs_bedford_140322.pdf|title=Canada v. Bedford: The Importance of the SCC Decision|last=Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They claimed that the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' prohibits sex workers from their labor rights because it permits sexual acts in exchange for money but criminalizes sex workers and their clients from communicating the exchange in a public setting. The plaintiffs argue that this is a violation of their constitutional right to freedom of expression and liberty and threatens their safety.   The case has now reached the Supreme Court of Canada and is supported by sex workers who believe it will eradicate the "whore stigma" that is often associated with sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Crystal|title=Why Decriminalizing Sex Work is Good for All Women|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/11/01/why-decriminalizing-sex-work-is-good-for-all-women/|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedford case had the impact of shifting Canada’s legal framework towards decriminalization, as the court recognized that these prohibitive criminal laws increase harm toward sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sexworklawreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after_bedford_140322.pdf|title=AFTER BEDFORD: Developing a health and safety framework for sex workers and Canadian communities|last=Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url= |archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In 1999, Sweden passed a law that banned prostitution and criminalizes buyers.  Since the implementation of the law, supporters of this approach have claimed the number of prostitutes has decreased. Pye Jakobsson, a spokeswoman for the [http://www.rosealliance.se Rose Alliance] and a representation for sex workers, believes that this reduction in numbers may not particularly mean less prostitution, and that "You can't talk about protecting sex workers as well as saying the law is good, because it's driving prostitution and trafficking underground, which reduces social services' access to victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hazel|last=Thompson|title=Prostitution: why Swedes believe they got it right|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/prostitution-sweden-model-reform-men-pay-sex |accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish example is often cited as a form of partial criminalization, rather than decriminalization, since the purchasing of sex remains a crime.&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt; Both the Swedish Government and sex workers agree that this model has increased stigma against sex workers, however the Swedish Government views this as a positive outcome – arguing that sending a message about sex work is more important. Sex workers have reported a number of human rights violations as a direct result of these laws, including the deportation of sex workers (even EU citizens), increased evictions and vulnerability to homelessness and high rates of discrimination from authorities including police and social services. 

===Denmark===
In Denmark, prostitution was decriminalized in 1999, allowing for both selling and buying of sex to be legal as long as both participants are above the age of 18.  Brothels and pimping, however, still remain illegal in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policy|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772#denmark |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, sex workers were permitted to work as long as it was not their only source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dane fights for state-funded sex|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4309012.stm|accessdate=16 December 2013 |newspaper=BBC News|date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada, USA===
The legalization of brothels in Nevada has shown that sex workers are better protected and are in less danger of health risks.&lt;ref name=nevada&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brents|first=Barbara G.|author2=Hausbeck, Kathryn|title=Violence and Legalized Brothel Prostitution in Nevada|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=270–295|url=http://esplerp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Violence-and-Legalized-Brothel-Prostitution-in-Nevada.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2013 |doi=10.1177/0886260504270333 |pmid=15684138|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.7766}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of precautions are taking to ensure the safety of the sex workers, such as a voice-recorded documentation of the negotiation that establishes the amount and payment before any trade occurs.  Many brothels also have a panic button that will alert the manager which is located in an accessible location, often above at the head or side of the bed.  Furthermore, the brothels in Nevada have established an ally relationship with law enforcement in cases where back-up was needed for troublesome customers.&lt;ref name=nevada /&gt;

===New South Wales, Australia===
Laws covering sex work in Australia are state and territory based, with different regulations in different places. New South Wales decriminalised sex work in 1995, after the Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption showed that police were inappropriate regulators of the sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/laws/nsw/ NSW: Decriminalisation since 1995]". Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex workers Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A governmental review in 2016 resulted in continuing support of decriminalisation of sex work "as the best way of protecting sex workers and maintaining a more transparent sex work industry".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2016-05-10.1825 WORLD RENOWNED, BEST PRACTICE MODEL OF SEX WORK DECRIMINALISATION TO REMAIN IN NSW 10 May 2016]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnocynology''', is a [[neologism]] coined by [[anthropologist]] [[Bryan Cummins]] in his book ''First Nations, First Dogs: Canadian Aboriginal Ethnocynology'' (2002).  It refers to the study of [[dog]]s within their cultural contexts.  The term is not in general use.  

Cummins states that the domestic dog, despite being found in virtually all human [[society|societies]], has been ignored by anthropologists. This, he says, is because the dog is neither fully of "[[culture]]" (being essentially a domesticated [[wolf]]), nor of "nature", by virtue of that same [[domestication]] and having been molded into over 400 [[breed]]s. Nonetheless, Cummins leans towards the view that, being domestic animals, they are more "of culture" than "of nature", and culture is the domain of the anthropologist. Furthermore, different human societies have shaped the dog into precisely whatever roles people might have for the dog. Therefore, the domestic dog is worthy of anthropological attention; hence ethnocynology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The term '''Given Circumstances''' is a principle from [[Russia|Russian]] theatre practitioner [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s methodology for [[actor]] training, formulated in the first half of the 20th century at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. 

The term given circumstances is applied to the total set of environmental and situational conditions which influence the actions that a [[character (arts)|character]] in a [[drama]] undertakes. Although a ''character'' may make such choices unconsciously, the ''actor'' playing the character is aware of such conditions on a conscious level to help him or her deepen his or her understanding of the [[motivation]] behind the character's actions. Given circumstances include conditions of the character's world (e.g. specifics of time and place: in [[Hamlet]] for instance, being in [[Elsinore]] at a specific time in history is a given circumstance), elements from the history of the character's environment (''cf'' Hamlet: the death of the old King Hamlet preceding the play's plot is a given circumstance), and elements from the character's personal situation (''cf'' Hamlet: the character Hamlet is a crown prince). 

In his own writing on his theatre practice, Stanislavski describes given circumstances as ''"The plot, the facts, the incidents, the period, the time and place of the action, the way of life. [...] The Given Circumstances, just like "if", are suppositions, "products of the imagination."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15292">[[File:Golden Tea Room MOA Museum (4).jpg|thumb|Golden Tea Room, in the [[MOA Museum of Art]], Atami]]
The {{nihongo|'''Golden Tea Room'''|黄金の茶室|Ōgon no chashitsu}} was a portable [[gilding|gilded]] ''[[chashitsu]]'' (tea room) constructed during the 16th century [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] for the [[kampaku|Japanese regent]] Lord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremonies]].  The original room is lost, but a number of reconstructions have been made.

== History ==
[[File:Toyotomi Hideyoshi.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=In this artwork a Japanese man in with a black hat and traditional clothing sits on the floor with a closed fan in his right hand|Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the patron of the room]] 
As Hideyoshi defeated a large number of opposing ''[[samurai]]'' clans, he also gained more control over [[precious metal]] mines.&lt;ref name="q50bU2oPj98C"/&gt; There is scant information as when precisely the room was built, by which artisans, and for what total cost. In 1585, the court appointed him to the prestigious position of Imperial Regent (''kampaku''). The first mention of the room is dated to January of the year [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō]] 14 (1586), when he had the room brought to the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] to host [[Emperor Ōgimachi]].&lt;ref name="q50bU2oPj98C"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murase|first=Miyeko|title=Turning Point: Oribe and the Arts of Sixteenth-century Japan|url={{Google books|q50bU2oPj98C|page=7|plainurl=yes}}|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians typically assume that the room was completed around or shortly before that date, probably expressly for the first official visitor that Hideyoshi hosted as regent.

After this crowning inauguration, the regent would exhibit his most precious [[special tea tools]] (''[[meibutsu]]'') in the room and give tours of it to his guests.&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt; Its use was again recorded for the [[Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony]] on ''[[Shíyuè]]'' 1, Tenshō 15 (November 1, 1587) at the [[Kitano Tenmangū]] shrine in [[Kyoto]]. It was transported from [[Osaka Castle]] to [[Nagoya Castle (Hizen Province)]] in the fifth month of [[Bunroku]] 1 (1592).&lt;ref name="pS_RAgAAQBAJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="q50bU2oPj98C8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murase|first=Miyeko|title=Turning Point: Oribe and the Arts of Sixteenth-century Japan|url={{Google books|q50bU2oPj98C|page=8|plainurl=yes}}|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Nagoya Castle, Hideyoshi launched the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]].&lt;ref name="pS_RAgAAQBAJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadler|first=A.

The room was made from [[Japanese cypress]], [[bamboo]], reeds, and [[silk]], and could be disassembled and packed into crates for transport  then transported and set-up again at different locations wherever the lord desired it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=2013-09-14|title=秀吉愛用「黄金の茶室」復元品を組み立て |trans-title=Hideyoshi's "Golden Tea Room" restored items assembled |url=http://www1.saga-s.co.jp/news/saga.0.2550015.article.html |language=Japanese |work=Saga Shimbun |location=[[Saga, Saga|Saga]] |access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room was probably near the size of three ''[[tatami]]'' mats, or {{convert|2.865|m|ft|abbr=on}} &amp;times; {{convert|5.73|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt; Its layout and appearance adhered to a standard ''chashitsu'' tea room with flat walls and rectangular pillars devoid of any carvings,  with a flat or [[coffer]]ed ceiling, and ''[[tokonoma]]'' alcove. It would typically be assembled within a larger room in a castle or residence. The [[gold leaf]] covered every surface inside and outside of the room, including the ''[[shōji]]'' sliding doors.&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="osakacastle.net"/&gt; [[Silk]] [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]] was on the latticework of the sliding doors.&lt;ref name="pS_RAgAAQBAJ"/&gt; The ''[[tatami]]'' mats on the floor were also covered with a [[crimson]] [[felt]] or fabric.&lt;ref name="pS_RAgAAQBAJ"/&gt; The tea utensils were all either made out of gold or gilded, except for the [[whisk]] and the cloth.&lt;ref name="q50bU2oPj98C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="osakacastle.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moaart.or.jp"/&gt;

The Golden Tea Room was constructed to impress guests with the might and power of the regent. This was in contrast to the rustic aesthetics codified under his tea master [[Sen no Rikyū]], although it is speculated that Rikyū might have helped in the design.&lt;ref name="osakacastle.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlynativejapan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlynativejapan.com/2015/07/29/the-golden-tea-room-was-portable-to-practice-gorgeous-tea-ceremonies-anywhere/5540 |title=【Culture】The golden tea room was portable to practice gorgeous tea ceremonies anywhere |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-07-29 |website=onlynativejapan.com |publisher=Only Native Japan |access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room's opulence was highly unusual and may have also been against ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' norms.&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt; At the same time, the simplicity of the overall design with its clean lines could be seen as within the canon. The extent of teamaster Rikyū's involvement in the design of the room is not known, however he was in attendance on a number of occasions when tea was being served to guests in the room.&lt;ref name="O8MjO6U62xgC86"/&gt;

Hideyoshi's rise from a lower-class background to the most powerful person and unifier of the realm was something completely new in Japanese history. Despite the ongoing war under his rule, the country was nevertheless starting to emerge from the violent [[Sengoku period]]. As the old order broke down and a new one emerged, so did the tastes in art. Many warriors who came from provinces outside of the capital did not have deep contacts with the subdued and restrained courtly aesthetics, but searched for something that was more reflective of their character and life experiences. A shift in usage of colours, patterns, materials, and gold started already under the predecessor [[Oda Nobunaga]], and was a hallmark of the Azuchi–Momoyama period.&lt;ref name="q50bU2oPj98C8"/&gt; The shift is represented in the new architectural style of [[Azuchi Castle]] and the Jurakudai residence in the Momoyama district of Kyoto, which gave the period its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miyeko|first=Murase|title=Turning Point: Oribe and the Arts of Sixteenth-century Japan|url={{Google books|q50bU2oPj98C|page=4|plainurl=yes}}|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Tea Room was a part of this new taste, but unique in the history of the way of tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitelka|first=Morgan|title=Spectacular Accumulation: Material Culture, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Samurai Sociability|url={{Google books|B8BUCwAAQBAJ|page=|plainurl=yes}}|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The room features in a scene in the 1962 movie ''[[Love Under the Crucifix]]'', directed by Kinuyo Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitelka|first=Morgan|title=Japanese Tea Culture: Art, History and Practice|url={{Google books|7YdTAQAAQBAJ|page=153|plainurl=yes}}|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic event of the regent presenting tea to the emperor in the room, and the ultimately conflicting relationship between Hideyoshi and his teamaster is shown in the 1989 film ''[[Rikyu (film)|Rikyu]]'', by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitelka|first=Morgan|title=Japanese Tea Culture: Art, History and Practice|url={{Google books|7YdTAQAAQBAJ|page=159|plainurl=yes}}|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muiredach s Cross.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Muiredach's High Cross]], [[Monasterboice]], 9th or 10th century]]
[[File:Cloncha cross church.jpg|thumb|A simpler example, [[Culdaff]], [[County Donegal]], Ireland]]
A '''high cross''' or '''standing cross''' ({{lang-ga|cros ard / ardchros}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focal.ie/Search.aspx?term=cros ard&amp;lang=2 Focal]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-gd|crois àrd / àrd-chrois}}, {{lang-cy|croes uchel / croes eglwysig}}) is a free-standing Christian [[cross]] made of stone and often richly decorated. There was a unique [[Early Medieval]] tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the [[Pictish stones]] of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]], which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain. 

Their [[relief]] decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as [[knotwork]], [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and in Britain [[vine-scrolls]], all in the styles also found in [[insular art]] in other media such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and metalwork. They were probably normally painted, perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs, in particular scenes crowded with small figures, are often now rather indistinct and hard to read.

The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures.  The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]]; this seems clearly an innovation of [[Celtic Christianity]], perhaps at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 118&lt;/ref&gt; The term "high cross" is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations.

Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as "[[preaching cross]]es" at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations.  They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period.  In the 19th century [[Celtic Revival]] Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world.  Unlike the Irish originals, the decoration usually does not include figures.

==Ireland and Britain==
[[File:VA23Oct10 101-crop-horz.jpg|thumb|left|Three views of the [[Northumbria]]n [[Easby Cross]] of 800–820]] 
[[File:King-donierts-stone.jpg|thumb|left|[[King Doniert's Stone]] in East [[Cornwall]], Ninth century]]
High crosses are the primary surviving monumental works of [[Insular art]], and the largest number in Britain survive from areas that remained under [[Celtic Christianity]] until relatively late.  No examples, or traces, of the putative earlier forms in wood or with metal attachments have survived; the decorative repertoire of early crosses certainly borrows from that of metalwork, but the same is true of Insular illuminated manuscripts.  Saint [[Adomnán]], [[Abbot of Iona]] who died in 704, mentions similar free standing ringed wooden crosses, later replaced by stone versions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Archaeology of late Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 400–1200 AD, Lloyd Robert Laing, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the earliest surviving free-standing stone crosses are at [[Carndonagh]], [[Donegal]], which appear to be erected by missionaries from [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Françoise. ''Irish art in the early Christian period'', 1940&lt;/ref&gt; fleeing the Viking raiders, "giving Iona a critical role in the formation of ringed crosses".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E. Karkov, Michael Ryan, Robert T. Farrell, ''The insular tradition'', p.138, SUNY Press, 1997, also citing ''The Chronology and Relationship of some Irish and Scottish Crosses'', J.R.S.A.I 86 [1956], pp. 85–89 by R.B.K Stevenson&lt;/ref&gt; The round bosses seen on early crosses probably derive from Pictish stones. High crosses may exist from the 7th century in [[Northumbria]], which then included much of south-east Scotland, and Ireland, though Irish dates are being moved later. However the dates assigned to most of the early crosses surviving in good condition, whether at Ruthwell and Bewcastle, the Western [[Kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]] group&lt;ref&gt;(Nancy Edwards, 1982.) ''A reassessment of the early medieval stone crosses and related stone sculpture of Offaly, Kilkenyn and Tipperary.''   http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7418/1/7418_4483-vol1.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; in Ireland, [[Iona]] or the [[Kildalton Cross]] on [[Islay]], have all shown a tendency to converge on the period around or slightly before 800, despite the differences between the Northumbrian and Celtic types. The high cross later spread to the rest of the British Isles, including the Celtic areas of [[Wales]], Devon, Brittany and [[Cornwall]], where [[ogham]] inscriptions also indicate an Irish presence, and some examples can be found on Continental Europe, particularly where the style was taken by Insular missionaries. 

Most Irish High crosses have the distinctive shape of the ringed [[Celtic cross]], and they are generally larger and more massive, and feature more figural decoration than those elsewhere. They have probably more often survived as well; most recorded crosses in Britain were destroyed or damaged by [[iconoclasm]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and typically only sections of the shaft remain. The ring initially served to strengthen the head and the arms of the high cross, but it soon became a decorative feature as well.

The high crosses were status symbols, either for a [[monastery]] or for a sponsor or patron, and possibly [[preaching cross]]es, and may have had other functions. Some have inscriptions recording the donor who commissioned them, like [[Muiredach's High Cross]] and the [[Bewcastle Cross]].  The earliest 8th- or 9th-century Irish crosses had only ornament, including interlace and round bosses, but from the 9th and 10th century, figurative images appear, sometimes just a figure of Christ crucified in the centre, but in the largest 10th century examples large numbers of figures over much of the surface.  Some late Irish examples have fewer figures, approaching life-size, and carved in very high relief.  The Irish tradition largely died out after the 12th century, until the 19th-century [[Celtic Revival]], when the Celtic cross form saw a lasting revival for gravestones and memorials, usually just using ornamental decoration and inscriptions.  These are now found across the world, often in contexts without any specific link to the Insular Celts or Britain.

[[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es were typically more slender, and often nearly square in section, though when, as with the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]], they were geographically close to areas of the Celtic Church, they seem to have been larger, perhaps to meet local expectations, and the two 9th century [[Mercia]]n [[Sandbach Crosses]] are the largest up to that period from anywhere.  The heads tend to be smaller and usually not Celtic crosses, although the majority of cross-heads have not survived at all.  Carved figures in these large examples are much larger and carved in deeper relief than the Irish equivalents with similar dates – only some very late Irish crosses show equally large figures.  Anglo-Saxon decoration often combines panels of vine-leaf scrolls with others of interlace, although the placement and effect from a distance is similar to Celtic examples.  Smaller examples may have only had such decoration, and inscriptions, which are much more common on Anglo-Saxon than Irish crosses.

After the [[Viking]] invasions, the settled [[Norse language|Norse]] population of the [[Danelaw]] adopted the form, and a number of crosses combine Christian imagery with pagan [[Sagas|Norse myths]], which the Church seems to have tolerated, and adopted at least as metaphors for the period when conversion was bedding down.  The [[Gosforth Cross]], a very rare almost-complete cross in England, is an example.  By the 10th century such Anglo-Norse crosses were the bulk of the production in England, as the high cross seems to have been abandoned further south, although the simple and practical [[Dartmoor crosses]], no doubt an essential aid to navigating [[Dartmoor]], appear to have continued to be made for centuries after.  Given the tough [[granite]] used, decoration is mostly slight and they are hard to date confidently. [[Market cross]]es, many once dating to the Early Medieval period, have continued to be erected and replaced until modern times.

In [[Pict]]ish Scotland the cross-slab, a flat stone with a cross in relief or incised on an essentially rectangular stone, developed as a hybrid form of the [[Pictish stone]] and the high cross.  The cross is normally only on one side of the stone and the remaining areas of the stone may be covered with interlace or other decoration.  These are usually distinguished from true high crosses.

==Scandinavia==
The tradition of raising high crosses appeared at a time when Norse settlers appeared in the British Isles and met a Christian culture. A fragmentary cross has been discovered in Granhammar in Vintrosa parish in [[Närke]], [[Sweden]] and testify to the English mission in the central Swedish provinces. In Norway the British tradition was more widely accepted and some 60 stone crosses are known from the country, but only four of them can be safely dated to the Viking Age thanks to runic inscriptions on the crosses. Many of the crosses have probably been raised on pagan grave fields when the family was baptised. Later, they were moved to cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=11102 The entry ''Stenkors'' in ''Vikingatidens ABC'' by Göran Tegnér.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819054426/http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=11102 |date=19 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cross tradition also probably helped increase the popularity of raising [[runestone]]s (often with engraved crosses) in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K.

==Modern period==
From the 19th century, many large modern versions have been erected for various functions, and smaller Celtic crosses have become popular for individual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract ornament, usually [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]].

In 1887, the Rev. William Slater Calverley commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Gosforth cross and had it erected in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria.[3]

In the early 21st century, Irish sculptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. The 13-foot, 5 tonne sandstone cross was completed in 2007 and shipped from [[Donegal]] to [[Portland, Oregon]], where it will stand as a Famine memorial. In 2016, a high cross was erected outside [[Wakefield Cathedral]], West Yorkshire, England, carved from stone quarried in [[Holmfirth]] and carved by Celia Kilner. This was based on the remains of a Saxon high cross, dated 930 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/saxon-cross-raised-at-wakefield-cathedral-1-7816824|title=Saxon cross raised at Wakefield Cathedral|website=www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seiyaku.com/customs/crosses/wakefield.html|title=Wakefield Cathedral Cross|website=seiyaku.com|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incremental reading''' is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, helping with the creation of [[flashcard|flashcards]] out of electronic articles read in portions inside a prioritized reading list.

It is particularly targeted to people who are trying to [[lifelong learning|learn for life]] a large amount of information, particularly if that information comes from various sources.

"Incremental reading" means "reading in portions". Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. Articles in the reading list are prioritized by the user.

In the course of reading, key points of articles are broken up into [[flashcard|flashcards]], which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period of time with the help of a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.

This use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on psychological principles of [[long-term memory]] storage and retrieval, in particular the [[spacing effect]] (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the [[testing effect]] (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing).

Current implementations include [[spaced repetition]] software [[Anki (software)|Anki]] – through an add-on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and [[SuperMemo]]. There is also incremental reading support for the text editors [[Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalReading |title=Incremental Reading |publisher=EmacsWiki |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yi (editor)|Yi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://code.haskell.org/yi/src/Yi/Mode/IReader.hs&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The method itself is often credited to the Polish software developer [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]. He implemented the first version of incremental reading in 1999 in [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 99]], providing the essential tools of the method: a prioritized reading list, and the possibility to extract portions of articles and to create [[Cloze test|cloze deletions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 99 made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing reading lists and the first primitive reading tools: extracts and clozes. Reading lists are prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts make it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions. Clozes make it possible to convert short sentences into question-answer format by means of cloze deletions.|accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "incremental reading" itself appeared the next year with [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 2000 greatly increased the efficiency of reading by introducing the concept of incremental reading.|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later SuperMemo programmes subsequently enhanced the tools and techniques involved, such as webpage imports, material overload handling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited incremental reading support for the text editor [[Emacs]] appeared in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=IncrementalReading|title=Emacs Wiki: recent changes to "Incremental Reading"|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Anki (software)|Anki]] add-on for incremental reading was later published in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frankraiser.de/drupal/AnkiIR|title=Anki Incremental reading|author=Frank Raiser|date=2011-03-15|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Anki 2.0 and 2.1, another add-on is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incremental reading was the first of a series of related concepts invented by [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]: incremental image learning, incremental video, incremental audio, incremental mail processing, incremental problem solving, and incremental writing. "Incremental learning" is the term Wozniak uses to refer to those concepts as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Components_of_incremental_learning|title=Components of incremental learning|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

When reading an electronic article, the user extracts the most important parts (similar to underlining or highlighting a paper article) and gradually distills them into [[flashcards]]. Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making [[active recall]] possible). [[Cloze deletions]] are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create out of text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.

With time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts, and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.

Contrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with [[active recall]]. This means that extracts such as "George Washington was the first U.S. President" must ultimately be converted into questions such as "Who was the first U.S. President?" (Answer: George Washington), or "Who was George Washington?" (Answer: the first U.S. President), etc, or [[cloze deletion|cloze deletions]] such as "[BLANK] was the first U.S. President", "George Washington was [BLANK]", etc.

This flashcard creation process is semi-automated – the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions, while the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards, and does the scheduling: it calculates the ideal time for the reader to review each chunk, according to the rules of [[spaced repetition]]. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.

Individual articles are read in portions proportional to the [[attention span]], which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piotr Wozniak |url= https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm#Attention|title=Advantages of incremental reading: attention|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.

The '''International Conference on Physics of Light–Matter Coupling in Nanostructures''' (PLMCN) is a yearly [[academic conference]] on various topics of [[semiconductor]] science and [[nanophotonic]]s.

== Topic ==
The conferences are devoted to the fundamental and technological issues relevant to the realization of a new generation of [[optoelectronic]] devices based on advanced low-dimensional and [[photonics|photonic]] structures, such as low threshold [[polariton]] [[lasers]], new [[optical]] switches, [[single photon emitters]], [[photonic crystal|photonic band-gap structures]], etc. They review the most recent achievements in the fundamental understanding of strong light–matter coupling, and follow the progress in the development of [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] and processing technologies of [[wide bandgap semiconductors]] and [[organic semiconductor|organic nanostructures]] and [[Microphotonics|microcavities]] providing the basis for advanced optical studies. The conferences are open to new emerging fields such as [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[quantum information]].

The scope of these conferences covers both [[physics]] and application of a variety of phenomena related to light–matter coupling in [[solids]] such as:

* Light–matter coupling in microcavities and [[photonic crystal]]s
* Basic [[exciton]]–[[polariton]] physics
* [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[polariton superfluid]]
* [[Spin (physics)|Spin]]-related phenomena
* Physics and application of [[quantum dot]]s
* [[Plasmon]]s and [[near-field optics]] in light matter coupling
* Growth and characterization of advanced [[wide bandgap semiconductors]] ([[GaN]], [[ZnSe]], [[ZnO]], [[organic semiconductor|organic materials]])
* Novel optical devices (polariton lasers, single-photon emitters, [[quantum eraser experiment|entangled-photon pair]] generators, optical switches...)
* [[Quantum information science]]

== Editions ==

The International Conference on Physics of Light–Matter Coupling in Nanostructures started in 2000 in [[Saint-Nectaire, Puy-de-Dôme|Saint-Nectaire]], [[France]]. The 14th edition was held as PLMCN14 instead of PLMCN13. The next issue in 2015 was held as PLMCN2014 instead of PLMCN15. The next issue after that was, confusingly, labelled as both PLMCN2015 and PLMCN16. The next conference, PLMCN17, reverted to the traditional labelling but now in sync with the edition number.

'''Karen Armstrong''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OBE|FRSL}} (born 14 November 1944) is a British author and commentator of [[Irish Catholic]] descent known for her books on [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Armstrong on Sam Harris and Bill Maher: "It fills me with despair, because this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps" |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/karen_armstrong_sam_harris_anti_islam_talk_fills_me_with_despair/|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former Roman Catholic [[nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|religious sister]], she went from a conservative to a more liberal and [[Christian mysticism|mystical Christian]] faith. She attended [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], while in the convent and majored in English. She became disillusioned and left the convent in 1969.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; Her work focuses on commonalities of the major religions, such as the importance of [[compassion]] and the [[Golden Rule]].

Armstrong received the US$100,000 [[TED (conference)|TED Prize]] in February 2008. She used that occasion to call for the creation of a ''[[Charter for Compassion]]'', which was unveiled the following year.

== Early life ==
Armstrong was born at Wildmoor, [[Worcestershire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=Through A Narrow Gate: A Memoir of Spiritual Discovery|publisher=Macmillan|year=2005|edition=Revised|pages=7|isbn=0-312-34095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a family of Irish ancestry who, after her birth, moved to [[Bromsgrove]] and later to [[Birmingham]]. In 1962, at the age of 18, she became a member of the [[Society of the Holy Child Jesus|Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus]], a teaching [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]], in which she remained for seven years.  Armstrong claims she suffered physical and [[psychological abuse]] in the convent; according to an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, "Armstrong was required to [[Mortification of the flesh|mortify]] her flesh with whips and wear a spiked chain around her arm. When she spoke out of turn, she claims she was forced to sew at a [[treadle machine]] with no needle for a fortnight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Armstrong: The compassionate face of religion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/03/profile-karen-armstrong-religion|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once she had advanced from [[postulant]] and [[novice]] to professed nun, she enrolled in [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], to study English. Armstrong left her order in 1969 while still a student at Oxford. After graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|Congratulatory First]], she embarked on a [[Doctorate of Philosophy|DPhil]] on the [[poet]] [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]. According to Armstrong, she wrote her [[dissertation]] on a topic that had been approved by the university committee. Nevertheless, it was failed by her external examiner on the grounds that the topic had been unsuitable.&lt;ref name="Spiral Staircase"&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out Of Darkness''. New York: Random House, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong did not formally protest this verdict, nor did she embark upon a new topic but instead abandoned hope of an academic career. She reports that this period in her life was marked by ill-health stemming from her lifelong but, at that time, still undiagnosed [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGrath|first=Alister|year=2006|title=Spirituality and well-being: some recent discussions|journal=Brain|volume=129|issue=1|pages=278–282|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/1/278.full|doi=10.1093/brain/awh719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The runaway nun |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200404050042 |publisher=[[New Statesman]] |date=5 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time she was lodged with Jenifer and [[H. L. A. Hart|Herbert Hart]], looking after their disabled son, as told in her memoir ''The Spiral Staircase''.&lt;ref name="Spiral Staircase"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1976, Armstrong took a job teaching English at [[James Allen's Girls' School]] in [[Dulwich]] while working on a memoir of her [[convent]] experiences. This was published in 1982 as ''Through the Narrow Gate'' to excellent reviews. That year she embarked on a new career as an independent writer and [[broadcasting]] [[Television presenter|presenter]]. In 1984, the British [[Channel Four]] commissioned her to write and present a [[television documentary]] on the life of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], ''The First Christian'', a project that involved traveling to the [[Holy Land]] to retrace the steps of the saint. Armstrong described this visit as a "breakthrough experience" that defied her prior assumptions and provided the inspiration for virtually all her subsequent work. In ''[[A History of God]]: The 4,000-Year Quest of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]'' (1993), she traces the evolution of the three major [[monotheistic]] traditions from their beginnings in the [[Middle East]] up to the present day and also discusses [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. As guiding "luminaries" in her approach, Armstrong acknowledges (in ''The Spiral Staircase'' and elsewhere) the late Canadian [[theologian]] [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], a [[Protestant]] minister,&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Case for God'', p. 87, footnote 42&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jesuit father [[Bernard Lonergan]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Case for God'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, she published ''[[Jerusalem]]: One City, Three Faiths''.

Armstrong's ''The Great Transformation: The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions'' (2006) continues the themes covered in ''A History of God'' and examines the emergence and codification of the world's great religions during the so-called [[Axial age]] identified by [[Karl Jaspers]]. In the year of its publication Armstrong was invited to choose her eight favourite records for [[BBC Radio]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs20060212.shtml |title= Desert Island Discs, February 12, 2006: Karen Armstrong |accessdate= 9 April 2008 |work= BBC Radio 4 Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has made several appearances on television, including on [[Rageh Omaar]]'s programme ''[[The Life of Muhammad]]''. She was an advisor for the award-winning, [[PBS]]-broadcast documentary ''[[Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet]]'' (2002), produced by Unity Productions Foundation.

In 2007 the [[Islamic Religious Council of Singapore]] invited Armstrong to deliver the MUIS Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muis.gov.sg/newsletternet/v.aspx?n=85 Karen Armstrong delivers the 2007 MUIS lecture], muis.gov.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong is a fellow of the [[Jesus Seminar]], a group of scholars and laypeople which attempts to investigate the historical foundations of Christianity. She has written numerous articles for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and for other publications. She was a key advisor on [[Bill Moyers]]' popular [[PBS]] series on religion, has addressed members of the [[United States Congress]], and was one of three scholars to speak at the UN's first ever session on religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelavinagency.com/college/karenarmstrong.html Karen Armstrong Speaker Profile at The Lavin Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], thelavinagency.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517022702/http://www.thelavinagency.com/college/karenarmstrong.html |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a vice-president of the British Epilepsy Association, otherwise known as [[Epilepsy Action]].

Armstrong, who has taught courses at [[Leo Baeck College]], a [[rabbinical]] college and centre for Jewish education located in [[North London]], says she has been particularly inspired by the [[Jewish ethics|Jewish]] tradition's emphasis on practice as well as faith: "I say that religion isn't about believing things. It's about what you do. It's [[ethical]] [[alchemy]]. It's about behaving in a way that changes you, that gives you intimations of holiness and sacredness."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Weich, [http://www.powells.com/blog/?p=14106 "Karen Armstrong, Turn, Turn, Turn".]&lt;/ref&gt; She maintains that religious [[fundamentalism]] is not just a response to, but is a product of [[Modernism|contemporary culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20070705 |title= Voices on Antisemtisim interview with Karen Armstrong |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date= 5 July 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120215165824/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20070705 |archivedate= 15 February 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason concludes that, "We urgently need to make [[compassion]] a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend [[selfishness]], compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to [[human relationships]] and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensable to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://charterforcompassion.org/share/the-charter/ The Charter for Compassion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510213651/http://charterforcompassion.org/share/the-charter/ |date=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awarded the $100,000 [[TED (conference)|TED Prize]] in February 2008, Armstrong called for drawing up a ''[[Charter for Compassion]]'', in the spirit of the [[Golden Rule]], to identify shared moral priorities across religious traditions, in order to foster global understanding and a peaceful world.&lt;ref name="TEDprize"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tedprize.org/?page_id=8 |title= TEDPrize 2008 Winner :: Karen Armstrong |accessdate= 19 March 2008 |work= TEDPrize Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented in [[Washington, D.C.]] in November 2009. Signatories include [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] and [[Paul Simon]].&lt;ref name="Unveiling-AFP"&gt;

Armstrong was honoured by the New York Open Center in 2004 for her "profound understanding of religious traditions and their relation to the divine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencenter.org/galahonorees/ |date=2009 |accessdate=9 October 2009 |title=Open Center Gala Honorees |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103190743/http://www.opencenter.org/galahonorees/ |archivedate= 3 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She received an honorary degree as Doctor of Letters by [[Aston University]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/history/honorary-graduates/ |title=Honorary Graduates of the University |publisher=Aston University |accessdate=25 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hQFmLKoN?url=http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/history/honorary-graduates/ |archivedate=10 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008 she was awarded the [[Four Freedoms Award|Freedom of Worship Award]] by the [[Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute|Roosevelt Institute]], one of four medals presented each year to men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to the [[Four Freedoms]] proclaimed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1941 as essential to democracy: [[freedom of speech]] and of worship, freedom from want and from fear. The institute stated that Armstrong had become "a significant voice, seeking mutual understanding in times of turbulence, confrontation and violence among religious groups." It cited "her personal dedication to the ideal that peace can be found in religious understanding, for her teachings on compassion, and her appreciation for the positive sources of [[spirituality]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fourfreedoms.nl/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=16&amp;laureate=77 |title=The Franklin D.

Through a series of books and award-winning lectures she reaches out as a peace-making voice at a time when world events are becoming increasingly linked to religion."

On 12 May 2010, she was made honorary Doctor of Divinity by [[Queen's University]] (Kingston, Ontario).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/gazette/content/former-prime-minister-paul-martin-among-queens-honorary-degree-recipients/ |title=Former Prime Minister Paul Martin among Queen's honorary degree recipients}}, Queen's Gazette&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Armstrong was bestowed [[Princess of Asturias]] award in recognition of her investigations into world religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.apnews.com/306547297bb044f49b8b2a93de08301e |title= Religion Scholar Karen Armstrong Wins Top Spanish Award|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Armstrong has been called "a prominent and prolific religious historian" by ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406932.html|title=Review of Karen Armstrong's "Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life"|last=Bonos|first=Lisa|date=16 January 2011|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described as "arguably the most lucid, wide-ranging and consistently interesting religion writer today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2001/04/18/armstrong/index.html|title="Buddha" by Karen Armstrong|last=Miller|first=Laura|work=Salon|accessdate=21 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045944/http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2001/04/18/armstrong/index.html|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Eduardo Campo, author of the ''Encyclopedia of Islam (Encyclopedia of World Religions)'' (2009), included Armstrong among a group of scholars whom he considered as currently conveying a "more or less objective" (as opposed to [[polemics|polemical]]) view of Islam and its origins to a wide public in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Review of ''[Muhammad and the Origins of Islam]'' by F. E. Peters |journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=28|issue=4| pages=597–599 |date=November 1996 |doi=10.1017/s0020743800063911}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks]] she was in great demand as a [[lecturer]], pleading for [[inter-faith dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secular Outlook: In Defense of Moral and Political Secularism |first1=Paul |last1=Cliteur |authorlink=Paul Cliteur |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |isbn=1-4443-9044-9 |page=249 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeBa-9NUKmEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SeBa-9NUKmEC&amp;pg=PA249&amp; Extract of page 249]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] activist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] criticizes Armstrong's "benign" view of Islam, contending that "Islam, as it is currently understood and practiced by vast numbers of the world's Muslims, is antithetical to [[civil society]]."&lt;ref name="Harris2009"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |date=5 May 2008 |title=Losing Our Spines to Save Our Necks |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/losing-our-spines-to-save_b_100132.html? |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris is also strongly critical of Armstrong's "religious [[apologetics|apology]]" of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], accusing her and like-minded scholars of [[political correctness]].&lt;ref name="Harris2009"/&gt; Armstrong has also attracted the criticism of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and [[Christian apologetics|apologist]] [[William Lane Craig]]. In Craig's response to a debate between Armstrong and the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] published in the 12 September 2009 issue of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Armstrong |first1=Karen |last2=Dawkins |first2=Richard |date=12 September 2009 |title=Man vs. God |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig criticizes Armstrong's "[[anti-realism|anti-realist]]" views about statements concerning God, particularly her assertion that "'God' is merely a symbol that points beyond itself to an indescribable transcendence." Craig argues that Armstrong's view of God as [[ineffability|ineffable]] is "self-refuting" and "logically incoherent". Craig also disputes Armstrong's characterization of the religious views of [[early Christianity|early Christians]].&lt;ref name="RF-Podcast2009"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.reasonablefaith.org/dawkins-vs-armstrong|title=Dawkins vs. Armstrong |publisher=Reasonable Faith |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=20 September 2009 |time=16:50 |accessdate=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Armstrong commented on comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s [[criticism of Islam]] by telling ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' "this is the sort of talk that led to the [[concentration camps]] in Europe. This is the kind of thing people were saying about Jews in the 1930s and '40s in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/karen_armstrong_sam_harris_anti_islam_talk_fills_me_with_despair/|title=Karen Armstrong on Sam Harris and Bill Maher: "It fills me with despair, because this is the so...|date=23 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maher responded to Armstrong's comments by telling ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', "It’s beyond stupid. Jews weren’t oppressing anybody. There weren’t 5,000 militant Jewish groups. They didn’t do a study of treatment of women around the world and find that the Jews were at the bottom of it. There weren’t 10 Jewish countries in the world that were putting [[homosexuality|gay]] people to death just for being gay. It’s idiotic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/12/bill-maher-interview-islam-berkeley|title=Petition All You Want, Bill Maher Will Speak at Berkeley|first=Sally|last=Kohn|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/12/05/its_beyond_stupid_bill_maher_responds_to_berkeley_petition_and_karen_armstrong/|title="It’s beyond stupid": Bill Maher responds to backlash against Islam views|date=5 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that Armstrong reiterated her criticism of Maher by telling ''[[The New York Times]]'', "My problem with some current critics of Islam is that their criticism is neither accurate, fair, nor well-informed. I am sure they do not intend this, but in the 1930s and '40s in Europe, we learned how dangerous and ultimately destructive this kind of discourse could be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/the-blame-game-karen-armstrong-talks-about-fields-of-blood/|title=The Blame Game: Karen Armstrong Talks About 'Fields of Blood'|first=John|last=Williams|date=26 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LADSS''', or '''land allocation decision support system''', is an agricultural [[land-use planning]] tool developed at [[The Macaulay Institute]].  More recently the term LADSS is used to refer to the research of the team behind the original planning tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spatial Decision Support Systems: Principles and Practices|author=Ramanathan Sugumaran, John Degroote|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of research==
The focus of the research of the LADSS team has evolved over time from land use decision support towards policy support, climate change and the concepts of resilience and adaptive capacity.

==Recent studies==
The team has recently published a study which examines, from a Scottish perspective, a number of alternative scenarios for reform of CAP Pillar 1 Area Payments.  It focuses on two alternative classifications: the Macaulay Land Capability for Agriculture classification; and Less Favoured Area Designations; and includes analysis of the redistribution of payments from the current historical system.  The study is entitled: [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/LADSS/cap_flattening.html Modelling Scenarios for CAP Pillar 1 Area Payments using Macaulay Land Capability for Agriculture (&amp; Less Favoured Area Designations)] and was used to inform the [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/inquiry Pack Inquiry].

The EU [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/smile/ SMILE] (Synergies in Multi-scale Inter-Linkages of Eco-social Systems) project, focuses on the concept of [[social metabolism]] that draws attention to how energy, material, money and ideas are utilised by society.

The [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/aquarius/ Aquarius] project, which is aims is to find and implement sustainable, integrated land-water management through engaging with land managers.

The [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/copenhagen/ COP15] website which provides a series of briefing and scoping papers produced by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and contributed to by [[The Macaulay Institute]] to raise the profile of the ecosystems approach in the UNFCC 15th Conference of the Parties meeting in Copenhagen to tackling not just climate change mitigation and adaptation, but also poverty alleviation, disaster risk reduction, [[biodiversity loss]] and many other environmental issues.

==LADSS planning tool==
The LADSS planning tool is implemented using the programming language G2 from Gensym alongside a [[Smallworld]] GIS application using the [[Magik (programming language)|Magik programming language]] and an [[Oracle database]].  LADSS models crops using the [[CropSyst]] simulation model.  LADSS also contains a [[livestock]] model plus social, environmental and economic impact assessments.

LADSS has been used to address [[climate change]] issues affecting agriculture in [[Scotland]] and [[Italy]].  Part of this work has involved the use of General Circulation Models (also known as [[Global climate model]]s) to predict future climate scenarios.  Other work has included a study into how [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform will affect the uplands of [[Scotland]], an assessment of agricultural [[sustainability]] and rural development research within the AGRIGRID project.

Peer reviewed papers produced by LADSS are available for [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/LADSS/papers.html download] in PDF format.

== Genealogy and Nativity==

[[File:Gerard van Honthorst 001.jpg|thumb|240px|"Adoration of the Shepherds" by [[Gerard van Honthorst]], 1622]]
The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four canonical gospels: Matthew and Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|3:23–38|NIV}} {{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it downwards towards Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Where Christology began: essays on Philippians 2'' by [[Ralph P. Martin]], Brian J. Dodd 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25619-8}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Both gospels state that Jesus was begotten not by [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], but conceived miraculously in the womb of Mary by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=genpurpose &gt;''The purpose of the Biblical genealogies'' by Marshall D. Johnson 1989 {{ISBN|0-521-35644-X}} pp. 229–233&lt;/ref&gt; Both accounts trace Joseph back to [[David|King David]] and from there to [[Abraham]]. These lists are identical between Abraham and David (except for one), but they differ almost completely between David and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Fitzmyer, ''The Gospel According to Luke I–IX''. Anchor Bible. Garden City: Doubleday, 1981, pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Howard Marshall, "The Gospel of Luke" (''The New International Greek Testament Commentary''). Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew gives Jacob as Joseph’s father and Luke says Joseph was the son of Heli. Attempts at explaining the differences between the genealogies have varied in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'' by William Barclay 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22487-3}} pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; Much of modern scholarship interprets them as literary inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, ''The First Christmas'' (HarperCollins, 2009) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Luke and Matthew accounts of the birth of Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in [[Bethlehem]], in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the [[Census of Quirinius|census]] to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger.&lt;ref&gt;"biblical literature." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2011.  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature].&lt;/ref&gt; Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, [[Biblical Magi|The Magi]] follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the ''[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]''. [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus's family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Over the centuries, biblical scholars have attempted to reconcile these contradictions,&lt;ref name="autogenerated102"&gt;Mark D. Roberts ''Can We Trust the Gospels?: Investigating the Reliability of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John'' Good News Publishers, 2007 p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; while modern scholarship mostly views them as legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Casey, Maurice | year=2010 | pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthew' p. 47"&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by [[Daniel J.

===Locations of Ministry===
{{Main article|New Testament places associated with Jesus}}
[[Image:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|250px|[[Galilee]], [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and  [[Judea]] at the time of Jesus]]

In the New Testament accounts, the principle locations for the [[ministry of Jesus]] were Galilee and Judea, with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as Perea and Samaria.&lt;ref name=Redford117/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alister16"/&gt;

The [[Canonical gospel|gospel]] narrative of the ministry of Jesus is traditionally separated into sections that have a geographical nature.

:* ''Galilean ministry'': Jesus' ministry begins when after [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], he [[Return of Jesus to Galilee|returns to Galilee]], and [[Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum|preaches in the synagogue]] of Capernaum.&lt;ref name="Matthew' page 71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capernaum page 7"&gt;''Jesus in the Synagogue of Capernaum: The Pericope and its Programmatic Character for the Gospel of Mark'' by John Chijioke Iwe 1991 {{ISBN|9788876528460}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[first disciples of Jesus]] encounter him near the [[Sea of Galilee]] and his later Galilean ministry includes key episodes such as [[Sermon on the Mount]] (with the [[Beatitudes]]) which form the core of his moral teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation'' by Carl G. Vaught 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-918954-76-3}} pages xi-xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, 2005, {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}}, pages 63–68&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' ministry in the Galilee area draws to an end with the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox pages 97-110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redford165"/&gt;

:* ''Journey to Jerusalem'': After the death of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately [[Matthew 17]] and [[Mark 9]]) two key events take place that change the nature of the narrative by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his [[Confession of Peter|proclamation as Christ]] by Peter and [[transfiguration of Jesus|his transfiguration]].&lt;ref name="KingsburyMark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton132"/&gt; After these events, a good portion of the gospel narratives deal with Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem through [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and Judea.&lt;ref name="KingsburyMark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox pages 121-135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 189-207"/&gt; As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized.&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox page 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 211-229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt;

:* ''Final week in Jerusalem'': The final part of Jesus' ministry begins ([[Matthew 21]] and [[Mark 11]]) with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] after the [[raising of Lazarus]] episode which takes place in [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]. The gospels provide more details about the final portion than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the [[Holy Week|last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem]] which ends in his crucifixion.&lt;ref name="Turner613"/&gt; The New Testament accounts of the [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] and his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] are also in Judea.

=== Baptism and temptation===

[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Francesco Albani]]'s 17th-century ''Baptism of Christ'' is a typical depiction with the sky opening and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] descending as a dove the baptism was done by John.&lt;ref name=Ross30 &gt;''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-313-29329-0}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Baptism of Jesus]] marks the beginning of his [[ministry of Jesus|public ministry]]. This event is recorded in the [[Canonical Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark and Luke. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29-33]], rather than a direct narrative, [[John the Baptist]] bears witness to the episode.&lt;ref name=Zanzig118 &gt;''Jesus of history, Christ of faith'' by Thomas Zanzig 2000 {{ISBN|0-88489-530-0}} page 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnEBrown25 &gt;''The Gospel and Epistles of John: A Concise Commentary'' by Raymond Edward Brown 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-1283-5}} pages 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], John the Baptist preached a "[[Baptism in Christianity|baptism with water]]", not of forgiveness but of penance or repentance for the remission of sins ({{bibleref2|Luke|3:3}}), and declared himself a forerunner to one who would baptize 'with the Holy Spirit and with fire' ({{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}). In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington, Daniel J., SJ. "Jesus Goes Public." ''America,'' Jan. 7–14, 2008, pp. 38ff&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus came to the [[Jordan River]] where he was baptized by John.&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Mt|3:13-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2Cor|5:21|NIV|2 Cor. 5:21}}; {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|4:15}}; {{Bibleref2|1Peter|3:18|NIV|1 Peter 3:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. ''Jesus of Nazareth.'' Doubleday Religion, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-385-52341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baptismal scene includes the [[Heaven]]s opening, a dove-like descent of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]], and a [[Bath Kol|voice from Heaven]] saying, "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:17}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|1:11}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|3:21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.&lt;ref name=Harring63 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-5803-2}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopez95 &gt;''Christianity: A Biblical, Historical, and Theological Guide'' by Glenn Jonas, Kathryn Muller Lopez 2010 ISBN pages 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chilton187 &gt;''Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A.

G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt;

The ''temptation of Jesus'' is detailed in the gospels of [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|4:1-11|NIV}}, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt; [[gospel of Mark|Mark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Mark|1:12-13|NIV}}, NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gospel of Luke|Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|4:1-13|NIV}}, NIV&lt;/ref&gt; In these narratives, after being [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]], [[Jesus]] [[fasting|fasted]] for forty days and nights in the [[Judaean Desert]]. During this time, [[Devil in Christianity|the devil]] appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation, the devil departed and [[angel]]s came and brought nourishment to Jesus.

===Calling the disciples and early Ministry===

The calling of the [[first disciples of Jesus|first disciples]] is a key episode in the gospels which begins the active ministry of Jesus, and builds the foundation for the group of people who follow him, and later form the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew'' by Leon Morris'' 1992 {{ISBN|0-85111-338-9}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke'' by Fred B. Craddock 1991 {{ISBN|0-8042-3123-0}} p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:18-22|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|1:16-20|NIV}} and  {{bibleverse||Luke|5:1-11|NIV}} on the [[Sea of Galilee]]. {{bibleverse||John|1:35-51|NIV}} reports the first encounter with two of the disciples a little earlier in the presence of [[John the Baptist]]. Particularly in the [[Gospel of Mark]] the beginning of the ministry of Jesus and the call of the first disciples are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;''The beginning of the Gospel: introducing the Gospel according to Mark'' by Eugene LaVerdiere 1999 {{ISBN|0-8146-2478-2}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|5:1&amp;ndash;11|NIV}}),&lt;ref name="Lukepassage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%205:1-11&amp;version=NIV |title=Luke 5:1-11, New International Version |publisher=Biblegateway |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event is part of the first [[miraculous catch of fish]] and results in [[Saint Peter|Peter]] as well as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], the sons of Zebedee, joining Jesus [[vocation]]ally as disciples.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clowes (cleric)|John Clowes]], ''The Miracles of Jesus Christ'' published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK, 1817, p. 214, available on Google books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'' by Timothy Johnson, Daniel J. Harrington, 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-5805-9}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'', by Joel B. Green 1997 {{ISBN|0-8028-2315-7}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering of the disciples in {{bibleverse||John|1:35-51|NIV}} follows the many patterns of discipleship that continue in the New Testament, in that who have received someone else's witness become witnesses to Jesus themselves. Andrew follows Jesus because of the testimony of John the Baptist, [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] brings Nathanael and the pattern continues in {{bibleverse||John|4:4-26|NIV}} where the [[Samaritan Woman at the Well]] testifies to the town people about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''John'' by Gail R. O'Day, Susan Hylen 2006 {{ISBN|0-664-25260-5}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

This early period also includes the first [[miracle of Jesus]] in the ''[[Marriage at Cana]]'', in the [[Gospel of John]] where Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding and when the wine runs out Jesus turns water into wine by performing a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;H. Van der Loos, 1965 ''The Miracles of Jesus'', E.J. Brill Press, Netherlands page 599&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Royster 1999 ''The miracles of Christ'' {{ISBN|0-88141-193-0}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry and miracles in Galilee===
Jesus' activities in Galillee include a number of miracles and teachings. The beginnings of this period include [[The Centurion's Servant]] (8:5-13) and [[Calming the storm]] (Matthew 8:23-27) both dealing with the theme of faith overcoming fear.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary'' by R.

Gleave, Manchester, UK p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, Jesus also gathers disciples, e.g. [[Calling of Matthew|calls Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by R. T.

In the [[Mission Discourse]], Jesus instructs the [[twelve apostles]] who are named in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#10:2|Matthew 10:2-3]] to carry no belongings as they travel from city to city and preach.&lt;ref name="New Testament' page 324"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redford143"/&gt; Separately in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1-24]] relates the [[Seventy Disciples]], where Jesus appoints a larger number of disciples and sent them out in pairs with the ''Missionary's Mandate'' to go into villages before Jesus' arrival there.&lt;ref name=Ringe &gt;''Luke'' by Sharon H.

After hearing of the Baptist's death, Jesus withdraws by boat privately to a solitary place near [[Bethsaida]], where he addresses the crowds who had followed him on foot from the towns, and feeds them all by "[[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and two fish]]" supplied by a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Maguire 1863 ''The miracles of Christ'' published by Weeks and Co. London p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the gospels present the ''[[Jesus' walk on water|Walking on water]]'' episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22-23]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45-52]] and
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16-21]] as an important step in developing the relationship between Jesus and his disciples, at this stage of his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Chapin Tenney 1997 ''John: Gospel of Belief'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4351-4}} p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The episode emphasizes the importance of faith by stating that when he attempted to walk on water, [[Apostle Peter|Peter]] began to sink when he lost faith and became afraid, and at the end of the episode, the disciples increase their faith in Jesus and in Matthew 14:33 they say: "Of a truth thou art the Son of God".&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Pentecost 2000 ''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' {{ISBN|0-310-30940-9}} p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Major teachings in this period include the [[Discourse on Defilement]] in Matthew 15:1–20 and Mark 7:1–23 where in response to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: "What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'".&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus the miracle worker: a historical &amp; theological study'' by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 {{ISBN|0-8308-1596-1}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this episode Jesus withdraws into the "parts of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]" near the [[Mediterranean Sea]] where the [[Canaanite woman's daughter]] episode takes place in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#15:21|Matthew 15:21–28]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#7:24|Mark 7:24-30]].&lt;ref name=Twelftree133 &gt;''Jesus the miracle worker: a historical &amp; theological study'' by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 {{ISBN|0-8308-1596-1}} pages 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is an example of how Jesus emphasizes the value of faith, telling the woman: "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted."&lt;ref name=Twelftree133 /&gt; The importance of faith is also emphasized in the [[Cleansing ten lepers]] episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#17:11|Luke 17:11-19]].&lt;ref&gt;Berard L. Marthaler 2007 ''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' {{ISBN|0-89622-537-2}} page 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 ''All the Miracles of the Bible'' {{ISBN|0-310-28101-6}} page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gospel of Mark, after passing through [[Sidon]] Jesus enters the region of the [[Decapolis]], a group of ten cities south east of Galilee, where the [[Healing the deaf mute of Decapolis|Healing the deaf mute]] miracle is reported in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#7:31|Mark 7:31-37]], where after the healing, the disciples say: "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak." The episode is the last in a series of narrated miracles which builds up to Peter's proclamation of Jesus as Christ in Mark 8:29.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Williamson 1983 ''Mark'' {{ISBN|0-8042-3121-4}} pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation as Christ===
{{Main article|Confession of Peter}}
[[Image:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pietro Perugino]]'s depiction of the "Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter" by Jesus, 1492]]
The ''[[Confession of Peter]]'' refers to an episode in the New Testament in which in Jesus asks a  question to his disciples: "Who do you say that I am?" [[Apostle Peter]] proclaims [[Jesus]] to be [[Christ]] - the expected [[Messiah]]. The proclamation is described in the three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:13|Matthew 16:13-20]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:27|Mark 8:27–30]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:18|Luke 9:18–20]].&lt;ref name=Karris &gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament'' by Robert J. Karris 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-2211-9}} pages 885-886&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingsbury &gt;''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25752-6}} page xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in which Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among "the multitudes", asking: "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt; The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: ''But who do you say that I am?'' Only Simon Peter answers him: ''You are the Christ, the Son of the living God''.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christology and the New Testament'' by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22431-8}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:17|Matthew 16:17]] Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates him as the rock of the Church, and states that he will give Peter "the keys of the kingdom of heaven".&lt;ref name=Boring69 &gt;''The people's New Testament commentary'' by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22754-6}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[Son of God]]'' which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]] had revealed it to Peter.&lt;ref name=Yueh &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref name=Yueh /&gt; The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to [[Christology]] and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive statement for it in the New Testament narrative.&lt;ref name=Rudolf7 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Rudolf Schnackenburg 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4438-3}} pages 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is likely to be an addition by Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus of Nazareth | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Casey, Maurice | year=2010 | pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfiguration===
{{Main article|Transfiguration of Jesus}}
[[File:Alexandr Ivanov 015.jpg|thumb|240px|Transfiguration by [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexandr Ivanov]], 1824]]
The ''Transfiguration of Jesus'' is an episode in the New Testament narrative in which [[Jesus]] is [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]] (or metamorphosed) and becomes radiant upon a mountain.&lt;ref name=Lee21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lockyer213 /&gt; The [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#17:1|Matthew 17:1–9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#9:2|Mark 9:2-8]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:28|Luke 9:28–36]]) describe it, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Peter#1:16|2 Peter 1:16–18]] refers to it.&lt;ref name=Lee21 /&gt; In these accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles go to a mountain (the [[Mount of Transfiguration]]). On the mountain, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appear next to him and he speaks with them. Jesus is then called "[[Son of God|Son]]" by a voice in the sky, assumed to be [[God the Father]], as in the [[Baptism of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Lee21 &gt;''Transfiguration'' by Dorothy A. Lee 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-8264-7595-4}} pages 21-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transfiguration is one of the [[miracles of Jesus]] in the Gospels.&lt;ref name=lockyer213 &gt;Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 ''All the Miracles of the Bible'' {{ISBN|0-310-28101-6}} page 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, John, 1817, ''The Miracles of Jesus Christ'' published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK page 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rutter, ''Evangelical harmony'' Keating and Brown, London 1803. page 450&lt;/ref&gt; This miracle is unique among others that appear in the [[Canonical gospels]], in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth ''Church dogmatics'' {{ISBN|0-567-05089-0}} page 478&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered the Transfiguration "the greatest miracle" in that it complemented baptism and showed the [[Perfection of Christ|perfection]] of life in [[Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas M. Healy, 2003 ''Thomas Aquinas: theologian of the Christian life'' {{ISBN|978-0-7546-1472-2}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt; The Transfiguration is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of [[Jesus]], the others being [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name="digby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faith page 28"/&gt; In the New Testament, Transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth.&lt;ref name=DorothyLee2 &gt;''Transfiguration'' by Dorothy A. Lee 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-8264-7595-4}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final journey to Jerusalem===

After the death of [[John the baptist]] and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having [[Jesus predicts his death|predicted his own death there]].&lt;ref name="Mark pages 24-25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The temptations of Jesus in Mark's Gospel'' by Susan R.

Cox page 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 211-229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt; The area where Jesus was baptised is inferred as the vicinity of the Perea area, given the activities of the Baptist in [[Bethabara]] and [[Ænon]] in John [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:28|1:28]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:23|3:23]].&lt;ref name=BigPic &gt;''Big Picture of the Bible - New Testament'' by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 {{ISBN|1-57921-928-4}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sloyan11 &gt;''John'' by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 {{ISBN|0-8042-3125-7}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally assume that the route Jesus followed from Galilee to Jerusalem passed through Perea.&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt;

This period of ministry includes the [[Five Discourses of Matthew|Discourse on the Church]] in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains the role of his apostles in leading it.&lt;ref name=Jensen &gt;''Preaching Matthew's Gospel by Richard A.

The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future community of followers, and the role of his apostles in leading it.&lt;ref name="King pages 215-216"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chouinard /&gt; Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: "what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven". The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and clout.&lt;ref name="King pages 215-216"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chouinard &gt;''Matthew'' by Larry Chouinard 1997 {{ISBN|0-89900-628-0}} page 321&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of this period, the Gospel of John includes the [[Raising of Lazarus]] episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#11:1|John 11:1-46]] in which Jesus brings [[Lazarus of Bethany]] back to life four days after his burial.&lt;ref name="Cox155"/&gt; In the Gospel of John, the raising of Lazarus is the climax of the "seven signs" which gradually confirm the identity of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and the expected Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 312-313&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a ''pivotal episode'' which starts the chain of events that leads to the crowds seeking Jesus on his [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] - leading to the decision of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]] to plan to kill Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J.

The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and Judea.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt; Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the [[Raising of Lazarus]] episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt;

The week begins with the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]. During the week of his "final ministry in Jerusalem", Jesus visits the Temple, and has a [[Cleansing of the Temple|conflict with the money changers]] about their use of the Temple for commercial purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which [[Authority of Jesus Questioned|his authority is questioned]]. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot]], decides to [[Bargain of Judas|betray Jesus]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]].&lt;ref name=Lockyer106 &gt;''All the Apostles of the Bible'' by Herbert Lockyer 1988 {{ISBN|0-310-28011-7}} page 106-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the week, Jesus has the [[Last Supper]] with his disciples, during which he institutes the [[Eucharist]], and prepares them for his departure in the [[Farewell Discourse]]. After the supper, Jesus is [[Kiss of Judas|betrayed with a kiss]] while he is in [[agony in the garden]], and is [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]]. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies him]] three times, as [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|Jesus had predicted]] during the Last Supper.&lt;ref name=Cox182 &gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans 2005 ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'' {{ISBN|0-7814-4228-1}} page 122&lt;/ref&gt; The final week that begins with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem|entry into Jerusalem]], concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday.

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:36|Matthew 26:36-46]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:32|Mark 14:32-42]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:39|Luke 22:39-46]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:1|John 18:1]], immediately after the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray, Matthew and Mark identifying this place of prayer as [[Garden of Gethsemane]].&lt;ref name=Maj169 &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck83 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament'' edited by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-88207-812-0}} pages 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is accompanied by Peter, [[St. John the Apostle|John]] and [[St. James the Greater|James the Greater]], whom he asks to "remain here and keep watch with me." He moves "a stone's throw away" from them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says "My [[God the Father|Father]], if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it."&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt; Only the Gospel of Luke mentions the details of the sweat of blood of Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will of the Father. Returning to the disciples after prayer, he finds them asleep and in Matthew 26:40 he asks Peter: "So, could you men not keep watch with me for an hour?"&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;

While in the Garden, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] appears, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas [[the kiss of Judas|gives Jesus a kiss]] to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; One of Jesus' disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the men in the crowd.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; Luke states that Jesus [[miracles of Jesus|miraculously healed]] the wound and John and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his disciples should not resist his arrest. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:52|Matthew 26:52]] Jesus makes the well known statement: ''[[Live by the sword, die by the sword|all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword]]''.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;

In the narrative of the four canonical gospels after the [[arrest of Jesus|betrayal and arrest]] of Jesus, he is taken to the [[Sanhedrin]], a Jewish judicial body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E.

After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment. Pilate then orders Jesus' crucifixion.&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GBromiley1050 &gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W.

After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus is taken to ''[[Pilate's court]]'' in the ''[[praetorium]]''. Only in the [[Gospel of Luke]], finding that Jesus, being from [[Galilee]], belonged to [[Herod Antipas]]' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus to Herod]]. Herod Antipas (the same man who had previously ordered the death of [[John the Baptist]]) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he had been hoping to observe one of the [[miracles of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Carter &gt;''Pontius Pilate: portraits of a Roman governor'' by Warren Carter 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5113-1}} pages 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity.&lt;ref name=Niswonger172 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} page 172&lt;/ref&gt; After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (1995), ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. vol. K-P. p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jesus' return from Herod's court, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus to be innocent of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 vol. K-P, p. 979.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pilate decided to publicly [[Blood curse|wash his hands]] as not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case rather than as a judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bond |first=Helen Katharine |authorlink= |title=Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |location= |page=159 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx9fufbr7jcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-63114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew (New Cambridge Bible Commentary)'' by Craig A.

[[File:SVouet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''The Crucifixion'' (1622) by [[Simon Vouet]]; Church of Jesus, [[Genoa]]]] 
Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels, and is attested to by other sources of that age (e.g. Josephus and Tacitus), and is regarded as an historical event.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. |author2=[[Jesus Seminar]]  |authorlink=Robert W.

Carroll 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22701-5}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trials, Jesus made his way to [[Calvary]] (the path is traditionally called [[via Dolorosa]]) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]], the Romans compelling him to do so.&lt;ref name=Evans2003 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

Matthew's and Mark's gospels state that he refused this.&lt;ref name=Evans2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger211 /&gt;

The soldiers then crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross was the inscription [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]], and the soldiers and those passing by mocked him about the title. Jesus was crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebuked Jesus, while the other defended him.&lt;ref name=Evans2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miriam271 &gt;''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions'' by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-87779-044-0}} page 271&lt;/ref&gt; Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, comprising the [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven last sayings]] on the cross.&lt;ref name=Bromiley426 &gt;Geoffrey W.

In the three synoptic gospels, various [[Crucifixion of Jesus#Phenomena during the crucifixion|supernatural events]] accompany the crucifixion, including [[Crucifixion darkness and eclipse|darkness of the sky]], an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger211 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

Following Jesus' death on Friday, [[Joseph of Arimathea]] asked the permission of Pilate to remove the body.

The gospels state that the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), The followers of Jesus encounter him risen from the dead, after his tomb was [[empty tomb|discovered to be empty]].&lt;ref name=Evans521 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

The resurrected Jesus then appears to his followers that day and a number of times thereafter, delivers sermons and has supper with some of them, before ascending to Heaven. The gospels of Luke and Mark include brief mentions of the Ascension, but the main references to it are elsewhere in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt;

The four gospels have variations in their account of the resurrection of Jesus and his appearances, but there are four points at which all gospels converge:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|16:1–8|TNIV}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:1–8|TNIV}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|24:1–12|TNIV}}, and {{bibleref2|John|20:1–13|TNIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the turning of the stone that had closed the tomb, the visit of the women on "the first day of the week;" that the risen Jesus chose first to appear to women (or a woman) and told them (her) to inform the other disciples;  the prominence of [[Mary Magdalene]] in the accounts.&lt;ref name="Stagg2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Setzer, Claudia. "Excellent Women: Female Witness to the Resurrection." ''Journal of Biblical Literature,'' Vol. 116, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 259–272&lt;/ref&gt; Variants have to do with the precise time the women visited the tomb, the number and identity of the women; the purpose of their visit; the appearance of the messenger(s)—angelic or human; their message to the women; and the response of the women.&lt;ref name="Stagg2" /&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:5|Matthew 28:5]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:5|Mark 16:5]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:4|Luke 24:4]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:12|John 20:12]] his resurrection is announced and explained to the followers who arrive there early in the morning by either one or two beings (either men or angels) dressed in bright robes who appear in or near the tomb.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt; The gospel accounts vary as to who arrived at the tomb first, but they are women and are instructed by the risen Jesus to inform the other disciples.

The accounts of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:9|Mark 16:9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:15|John 20:15]] indicate that Jesus appeared to the Magdalene first, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#16:9|Luke 16:9]] states that she was among the [[Myrrhbearers]] who informed the disciples about the resurrection.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:11|Matthew 28:11-15]], to explain the empty tomb, the Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded the tomb to spread the rumor that Jesus' disciples took his body.&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;

[[Image:Correggio Noli Me Tangere.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Noli me Tangere]]'' by [[Antonio da Correggio]], c. 1534]]
After the discovery of the empty tomb, the gospels indicate that Jesus made a series of appearances to the disciples.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;

In {{Bibleref2|John|20:15-17|NIV}} Jesus appears to [[Mary Magdalene]] soon after his resurrection. At first she does not recognize him and thinks that he is the gardener. When he says her name, she recognizes him yet he tells her [[Noli me Tangere]], do not touch me, "for I am not yet ascended to my Father."

Later that day, at evening, Jesus appears to the disciples and shows them the wounds in his hands and his side in {{Bibleref2|John|20:19-21}}. [[Thomas the Apostle]] is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known [[Doubting Thomas]] episode in [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/John#20:24|John 20:24-29]] Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his finger into the holes made by the wounds in Jesus' hands and side.  Thomas then professes his faith in Jesus. In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:16–20|ESV}}, in the [[Great Commission]] Jesus appears to his followers on a mountain in [[Galilee]] and calls on them to baptize all nations in the name of the "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit".

{{Bibleref2|Luke|24:13-32|NIV}} describes the [[Road to Emmaus appearance]] in which while a disciple named [[Cleopas]] was walking towards [[Emmaus]] with another disciple, they met Jesus, who later has supper with them. {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:12-13|NIV}} has a similar account that describes the appearance of Jesus to two disciples while they were walking in the country, at about the same time in the Gospel narrative.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Comparative New Testament'' by Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-528299-X}} page 589&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Miraculous catch of 153 fish]] Jesus appears to his disciples on the [[Sea of Galilee]], and thereafter Jesus encourages [[Apostle Peter]] to serve his followers.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt;

===Ascension===
{{Main article|Ascension of Jesus}}
{{see also|Ascension of Jesus in Christian art}}
[[File:Benvenuto Tisi da Garofalo - Ascension of Christ - WGA08474.jpg|thumb|180px|''Ascension of Christ'' by [[Il Garofalo|Garofalo]] 1520]]
The ''Ascension of Jesus'' ([[anglicized]] from the [[Vulgate]] Latin [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|Acts 1:9-11]] section title: ''Ascensio Iesu'') is the Christian teaching found in the [[New Testament]] that the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]] was [[Entering heaven alive|taken up to heaven]] in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of his [[apostles]], occurring 40 days after the resurrection. In the biblical narrative, an [[angel]] tells the watching [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] that [[Second Coming of Jesus|Jesus' second coming]] will take place in the same manner as his ascension.&lt;ref&gt;"Ascension, The." Macmillan Dictionary of the Bible. London: Collins, 2002. ''Credo Reference.'' Web. 27 September 2010. {{ISBN|0333648056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canonical gospel]]s include two brief descriptions of the Ascension of Jesus in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:50|Luke 24:50-53]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:19|Mark 16:19]], in which it takes place on Easter Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Fred B. Craddock, Luke (Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), page 293&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of Jesus' bodily Ascension into the clouds is given in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|1:9-11]]) where the narrative starts with the account of Jesus' appearances after his resurrection and describes the event as taking place forty days later.&lt;ref name=Fred293 &gt;''Luke'' by Fred B. Craddock 2009 {{ISBN|0664234356}} pages 293-294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Matera53 &gt;''New Testament Theology'' by Frank J. Matera 2007 {{ISBN|066423044X}} pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts 1:9-12 specifies the location of the Ascension as the "[[Mount of olives|mount called Olivet]]" near Jerusalem. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:3|Acts 1:3]] states that Jesus: :"showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God". After giving a number of instructions to the apostles

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21473">'''Material culture''' is the physical aspect of [[culture]] in the objects and [[architecture]] that surround people. It includes usage, consumption, creation, and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms, and rituals that the objects create or take part in. Some scholars also include other intangible [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] that include sound, smell and events,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Material Culture of Multilingualism|last=Aronin|first=Larissa|last2=Hornsby|first2=Michael|last3=Kiliańska-Przybyło|first3=Grażyna|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319911038|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some even consider language as part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture|last=Kieschnick|first=John|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=0691096759|location=Princeton|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in archaeological and anthropological studies, specifically focusing on the material evidence that can be attributed to culture in the past or present. It is usually synonymous with artifacts, which humans use to cope with the physical world, facilitate social intercourse, and benefit man's state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences, Volume 1, Issue 1|last=Buchli|first=Victor|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0415267196|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly analysis of material culture - the human-made or altered things - is called '''material culture studies.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture in America: Understanding Everyday Life|last=Sheumaker|first=Helen|last2=Wajda|first2=Shirley|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9781576076477|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary field]] that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[historic preservation]], [[folklore]], [[literary criticism]] and [[museum studies]], among others. Anything from buildings and architectural elements to books, jewelry, or toothbrushes can be considered material culture.

== Material value ==

Research in several areas looked into the reasons for perceiving an object with meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value.

A well-known related theory is Kahneman's endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people evaluate objects they own with higher value than the same object if they do not own it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Knetsch|first2=Jack L.|last3=Thaler|first3=Richard H.|date=1991-01-01|title=Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias|jstor=1942711|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=5|issue=1|pages=193–206|doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment effect was found to occur as soon as the item is acquired and to increase over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strahilevitz|first=Michal A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1998-12-01|title=The Effect of Ownership History on the Valuation of Objects|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/25/3/276/1795651/The-Effect-of-Ownership-History-on-the-Valuation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=276–289|doi=10.1086/209539|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time, or space, or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lohmann|first=Andrew|last2=Arriaga|first2=Ximena B.|last3=Goodfriend|first3=Wind|date=2003-09-01|title=Close relationships and placemaking: Do objects in a couple's home reflect couplehood?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6811.00058/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=437–450|doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00058|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, "gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schieffelin|first=Edward L.|date=1980-01-01|title=Reciprocity and the Construction of Reality|jstor=2801347|journal=Man|volume=15|issue=3|pages=502–517|doi=10.2307/2801347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KNvxPSAYzbQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=the+gift+the+form&amp;ots=FXvgTLvKWT&amp;sig=TUMOcc7zIOAjDfDs9YcjcuksGHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20gift%20the%20form&amp;f=false|title=The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies|last=Mauss|first=Marcel|date=2000-01-01|publisher=W.

A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
Material culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of [[anthropology]] and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Ian|title=Understanding Material Culture|year=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location=New York, New York|isbn=0761942262}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the "golden age" of [[museum]]-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture.

The origins of the field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates back to the 1990s. The ''[[Journal of Material Culture]]'' started putting out publications only in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodward|first=Sophie|title=Material Culture|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0085.xml|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a sense that can be thought of as younger for tying closely to ethnographic work and collecting habits. [[Collecting]] habits date back to hundreds of years ago.

==Contributors==
[[Leslie White]] was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of [[cultural evolution]], [[sociocultural evolution]], and especially [[neoevolutionism]] and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]] Ann Arbor. He was president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (1964). He wrote ''The Science of Culture'' in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism] American Materialism&lt;/ref&gt;

American anthropologist [[James Deetz]], known for his work in the field of [[historical archaeology]], wrote the book "In Small Things Forgotten" in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects.

Ian M. G. Quimby's ''Material Culture and the Study of American Life'', written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education.

Thomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]], wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book ''Artifacts and the American Past'', Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts.

==Archaeology==
[[Archaeology]] is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Arthur Asa|title=What Objects Mean: An Introduction of Material Culture|year=2009|publisher=Left Coast Press Inc.|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=9781598744118|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[archaeological culture]] is a recurring [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of the [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |last=Renfrew |first=Colin |last2=Bahn |first2=Paul |year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kris Hurst|first=K|title=Material Culture|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/material_cultur.htm|work=About.com : Archaeology|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture.

Beginning in the European [[Renaissance]] and the culture's fascination with classical antiquities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of [[archaeological theory]], such as [[trans-cultural diffusion]], [[processual archaeology]], and [[post-processual archaeology]]. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including [[prehistoric archaeology]], [[classical archaeology]], [[historical archaeology]], [[cognitive archaeology]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology==

[[Anthropology]] is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used.

The first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on [[kinship]] and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Lewis Henry|title=Ancient Society|year=1877|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 19th century, [[Franz Boas]] brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Limitations of the Comparative Method of Anthropology|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Methods of Ethnology|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in France, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the [[social facts]] that functions as a coercive force to maintain [[solidarity]] in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Emile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical [[fieldwork]]. According to Lévi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 20th century, [[Mary Douglas]] thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Purity and Danger|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]], a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and said that all aspects of society have material causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cultural Materialism|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

In archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BUPlAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=material+culture+in+the+social+world&amp;ots=OfvHscrlHt&amp;sig=2pdpOqR1MmCBqyRwLgx5WrbNd0s#v=onepage&amp;q=material%20culture%20in%20the%20social%20world&amp;f=false|title=Material Culture In The Social World|last=Tim|first=Dant|date=1999-08-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335198214|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=noXhAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=love+objects+material+culture&amp;ots=l5m77l0Voh&amp;sig=TuC02c1Q-X9U3z0WS2sajuCK5pY#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20objects%20material%20culture&amp;f=false|title=Love Objects: Emotion, Design and Material Culture|last=Moran|first=Anna|last2=O'Brien|first2=Sorcha|date=2014-08-28|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781472517180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage industry==

Museums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the [[heritage industry]].  Defined as "the business of managing places that are important to an area's history and encouraging people to visit them," the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications.

That relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the [[humanities]] take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows [[curators]], researchers, and directors to conserve material culture's legacy.

==Current production==
Some observers advocate intentionally altering the material cultures created by current civilizations. For example, [[waste reduction]] advocates within [[environmentalism]] advocate [[design education|teaching design]] approaches, such as [[cradle-to-cradle design]] and [[appropriate technology]]. [[Anti-consumerism]] advocates encourage consuming less (thus creating fewer artifacts), engaging in more [[do-it-yourself]] projects and [[self-sufficiency]] (changing the quality of artifacts produced), and [[localism (politics)|localism]] impacts the geographic distribution and uniformity of artifacts.

'''Molecular paleontology''' refers to the recovery and analysis of [[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, or [[lipid]]s, and their [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] products from ancient human, animal, and plant remains.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higby Schweitzer|first=Mary|title=Molecular paleontology: some current advances and problems|journal=Annales de Paléontologie|date=April 2004|volume=90|issue=2|pages=81–102|doi=10.1016/j.annpal.2004.02.001|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/article/139901|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of molecular paleontology has yielded important insights into evolutionary events, species' [[diaspora]]s, the discovery and characterization of extinct [[species]]. By applying molecular analytical techniques to DNA in [[fossils]], one can quantify the level of relatedness between any two organisms for which DNA has been recovered.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=B.|author2=Hofreiter, M.|title=A Paleogenomic Perspective on Evolution and Gene Function: New Insights from Ancient DNA|journal=Science|date=23 January 2014|volume=343|issue=6169|pages=1236573–1236573|doi=10.1126/science.1236573|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1236573.short|accessdate=8 March 2014|pmid=24458647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in the field of molecular paleontology have allowed scientists to pursue [[evolution]]ary questions on a genetic level rather than relying on [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation alone. Using various biotechnological techniques such as [[DNA extraction|DNA isolation]],  [[Polymerase chain reaction|amplification]], and [[sequencing]]&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Waggoner|first=Ben|title=Molecular Palaeontology|url=http://faculty.uca.edu/benw/reprints/1627.pdf|publisher=Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have been able to gain expanded new insights into the divergence and evolutionary history of countless organisms.

==History==
The study of molecular paleontology is said to have begun with the discovery by Abelson of 360 million year old amino acids preserved in fossil shells.&lt;ref name="Organic constituents of fossils" /&gt;  However, [[Svante Pääbo]] is often the one considered to be the founder of the field of molecular paleontology.&lt;ref name=Hreha&gt;{{cite web|last=Hreha|first=Sarah|title=2013 Gruber Genetics Prize Press Release|url=http://gruber.yale.edu/genetics/press/2013-gruber-genetics-prize-press-release|publisher=Gruber Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of molecular paleontology has had several major advances since the 1950s and is a continuously growing field. Below is a timeline showing notable contributions that have been made.

It was concluded that these two species had a common ancestor 3-4 million years ago, which is consistent with known [[fossil]] evidence of the species.&lt;ref name=Higuchi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higuchi|first=Russell|author2=Bowman, Barbara |author3=Freiberger, Mary |author4=Ryder, Oliver A. |author5= Wilson, Allan C. |title=DNA sequences from the quagga, an extinct member of the horse family|journal=Nature|date=15 November 1984|volume=312|issue=5991|pages=282–284|doi=10.1038/312282a0|pmid=6504142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denisovans===
{{main|denisovan}}
The [[Denisovan]]s of [[Eurasia]], a hominid species related to Neanderthals and humans, was discovered as a direct result of DNA sequencing of a 41,000-year-old specimen recovered in 2008. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from a retrieved finger bone showed the specimen to be genetically distinct from both humans and Neanderthals. Two teeth and a toe bone were later found to belong to different individuals with the same population. Analysis suggests that both the Neanderthals and Denisovans were already present throughout Eurasia when modern humans arrived.&lt;ref name="Neanderthal Genome sequenced" /&gt; In November 2015, scientists reported finding a fossil tooth containing DNA from [[Denisovan]]s, and estimated its age at 110,000-years-old.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151116"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In a Tooth, DNA From Some Very Old Cousins, the Denisovans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/science/in-a-tooth-dna-from-some-very-old-cousins-the-denisovans.html |date=16 November 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151111"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Susanna |last2=Renaud |first2=Gabriel |last3=Viola |first3=Bence |last4=Hublin  |first4=Jean-Jacques |last5=Gansauge |first5=Marie-Theres |last6=Shunkov |first6=Michael V. |last7=Derevianko |first7=Anatoly P. |last8=Prüfer |first8=Kay |last9=Kelso |first9=Janet |last10=Pääbo |first10=Svante |title=Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from two Denisovan individuals |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/11/1519905112 |date=11 November 2015 |journal=[[PNAS]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1519905112 |accessdate=16 November 2015 |bibcode=2015PNAS..11215696S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mitochondrial DNA analysis====
[[File:Neanderthal DNA extraction.jpg|thumb|alt= A photo of Neanderthal DNA extraction in process | Neanderthal DNA extraction. Working in a clean room, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took extensive precautions to avoid contaminating Neanderthal DNA samples - extracted from bones like this one - with DNA from any other source, including modern humans. NHGRI researchers are part of the international team that sequenced the genome of the Neanderthal, Homo neanderthalensis.]]
The mtDNA from the Denisovan finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 bases ([[nucleotide]]s) in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and [[Neanderthal genome|Neanderthals]] is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between [[chimpanzee]]s and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs.&lt;ref name="Krause Johannes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=Johannes|author2=Fu, Qiaomei |author3=Good, Jeffrey M. |author4=Viola, Bence |author5=Shunkov, Michael V. |author6=Derevianko, Anatoli P. |author7= Pääbo, Svante |title=The complete mitochondrial DNA genome of an unknown hominin from southern Siberia|journal=Nature|date=24 March 2010|volume=464|issue=7290|pages=894–897|doi=10.1038/nature08976|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/nature08976.html|accessdate=22 April 2014 |pmid=20336068}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago.

These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents.&lt;ref name=Pennisi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennisi|first=E.|title=More Genomes From Denisova Cave Show Mixing of Early Human Groups|journal=Science|date=16 May 2013|volume=340|issue=6134|pages=799–799|doi=10.1126/science.340.6134.799|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/799|accessdate=22 April 2014|pmid=23687020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear genome analysis====
Isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA has also been accomplished from the Denisova finger bone. This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and low level of contamination. They were able to achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans.  From this analysis, they concluded, in spite of the apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, the Denisova population along with Neanderthal shared a common branch from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through [[genetic drift]] or else an [[introgression]] from an older hominin lineage.&lt;ref name=Reich /&gt;

===Homo heidelbergensis===
{{main|Homo heidelbergensis}}
[[File:Homo heidelbergensis-Cranium -5.jpg|left|thumb|160px|alt=A photo of the Denisovan cranium found at Sima de los Huesos|"[[Homo heidelbergensis]] Cranium 5 is one of the most important discoveries in the Sima de los Huesos, Atapuerca (Spain). The mandible of this cranium appeared, nearly intact, some years after its find, close to the same location.]]
Homo heidelbergensis was first discovered in 1907 near Heidelberg, Germany and later also found elsewhere in Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref name=Mounier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mounier|first=Aurélien|author2=Marchal, François |author3=Condemi, Silvana |title=Is Homo heidelbergensis a distinct species?

However it was not until 2013 that a specimen with retrievable DNA was found, in a ~400,000 year old femur found in the [[Atapuerca Mountains#Sima de los Huesos .281983-.29|Sima de los Huesos Cave]] in Spain. The femur was found to contain both mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Improvements in DNA extraction and library preparation techniques allowed for mtDNA to be successfully isolated and sequenced, however the nuclear DNA was found to be too degraded in the observed specimen, and was also contaminated with DNA from an ancient cave bear (''[[Ursus deningeri]]'') present in the cave.&lt;ref name=Meyer /&gt;  The mtDNA analysis found a surprising link between the specimen and the Denisovans, and this finding raised many questions. Several scenarios were proposed in a January 2014 paper titled "A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos", elucidating the lack of convergence in the scientific community on how ''Homo heidelbergensis'' is related to other known hominin groups. One plausible scenario that the authors proposed was that the ''H. heidelbergensis'' was an ancestor to both Denisovans and Neanderthals.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Matthias |author2=Fu, Qiaomei |author3=Aximu-Petri, Ayinuer |author4=Glocke, Isabelle |author5=Nickel, Birgit |author6=Arsuaga, Juan-Luis |author7=Martínez, Ignacio |author8=Gracia, Ana |author9=de Castro, José María Bermúdez |author10=Carbonell, Eudald |author11=Pääbo, Svante |title=A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos|journal=Nature|date=4 December 2013|volume=505|issue=7483|pages=403–406|doi=10.1038/nature12788|url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~paabo/pdf1/Meyer_Mitochondrial_nature_2014.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014 |pmid=24305051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Completely sequenced nuclear genomes from both Denisovans and Neanderthals suggest a common ancestor approximately 700,000 years ago, and one leading researcher in the field, Svante Paabo, suggests that perhaps this new hominin group is that early ancestor.&lt;ref name="Hominin DNA baffles experts"/&gt;

==Applications==

=== Discovery and characterization of new species ===
Molecular paleontology techniques applied to fossils have contributed to the discovery and characterization of several new species, including the Denisovans and ''Homo heidelbergensis''. We have been able to better understand the path that humans took as they populated the earth, and what species were present during this [[diaspora]].

===De-extinction===
[[File:Pyrenean Ibex.png|thumb|200px|alt=An artist's color drawing of the Pyrenean ibex|The [[Pyrenean ibex]] was temporarily brought back from extinction in 1984.]]

{{main|de-extinction}}

It is now possible to revive [[Extinction|extinct]] species using molecular paleontology techniques. This was first accomplished via [[cloning]] in 2003 with the [[Pyrenean ibex]], a type of wild goat that became extinct in 2000. Nuclei from the Pyrenean ibex's cells were injected into goat eggs emptied of their own DNA, and implanted into surrogate goat mothers.&lt;ref name=Zimmer&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=Bringing Extinct Species Back To Life|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/125-species-revival/zimmer-text|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offspring lived only seven minutes after birth, due to defects in its lungs. Other cloned animals have been observed to have similar lung defects.&lt;ref name="Ibex clone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Richard|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many species that have gone extinct as a direct result of human activity. Some examples include the [[dodo]], the [[great auk]], the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]], the [[Baiji|Chinese river dolphin]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. An extinct species can be revived by using [[Allele|allelic]] replacement&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite web|last=Church|first=George|title=Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineering (MAGE):  A machine that speeds up evolution is revolutionizing genome design|url=http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/330/|publisher=Wyss Institute|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of a closely related species that is still living. By only having to replace a few [[gene]]s within an organism, instead of having to build the extinct species' genome from scratch, it could be possible to bring back several species in this way, even Neanderthals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The ethics surrounding the re-introduction of extinct species are very controversial. Critics of bringing extinct species back to life contend that it would divert limited money and resources from protecting the world's current [[biodiversity]] problems.&lt;ref name="Scientific American De-extinction"&gt;{{cite news|last=The Editors|title=Why Efforts to Bring Extinct Species Back from the Dead Miss the Point|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-efforts-bring-extinct-species-back-from-dead-miss-point/|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Scientific American|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With current extinction rates approximated to be 100 to 1,000 times the background extinction rate,&lt;ref name="Future of Biodiversity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pimm|first=S.

As the editors of a Scientific American article on de-extinction pose: Should we bring back the woolly mammoth only to let elephants become extinct in the meantime?&lt;ref name="Scientific American De-extinction" /&gt; The main driving factor for the extinction of most species in this era (post 10,000 BC) is the loss of habitat, and temporarily bringing back an extinct species will not recreate the environment they once inhabited.&lt;ref name="Causes of Extinction"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Michael|title=Causes of Extinction|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150962/|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of de-extinction, such as [[George M. Church|George Church]], speak of many potential benefits. Reintroducing an extinct keystone species, such as the [[woolly mammoth]], could help re-balance the ecosystems that once depended on them. Some extinct species could create broad benefits for the environments they once inhabited, if returned. For example, woolly mammoths may be able to slow the melting of the Russian and Arctic tundra in several ways such as eating dead grass so that new grass can grow and take root, and periodically breaking up the snow, subjecting the ground below to the arctic air. These techniques could also be used to reintroduce genetic diversity in a threatened species, or even introduce new genes and traits to allow the animals to compete better in a changing environment.&lt;ref name="George Church Sci Am"&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=George|title=De-Extinction Is a Good Idea|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/george-church-de-extinction-is-a-good-idea/|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=Scientific American|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and technology==
When a new potential specimen is found, scientists normally first analyze for cell and tissue preservation using [[Histology|histological techniques]], and test the conditions for the survivability of DNA. They will then attempt to isolate a DNA sample using the technique described below, and conduct a [[PCR amplification]] of the DNA to increase the amount of DNA available for testing. This amplified DNA is then sequenced. Care is taken to verify that the sequence matches the phylogenetic traits of the organism.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;  When an organism dies, a technique called [[amino acid dating]] can be used to age the organism. It inspects the degree of [[racemization]] of [[aspartic acid]], [[leucine]], and [[alanine]] within the tissue. As time passes, the D/L ratio (where "D" and "L" are mirror images of each other) increase from 0 to 1.&lt;ref name=AAGL&gt;{{cite web|title=Method: Principles|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~dsk5/AAGL/method/principles.html|work=Amino Acid Geochronology Laboratory|publisher=Northern Arizona University|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In samples where the D/L ratio of aspartic acid is greater than 0.08, ancient DNA sequences can not be retrieved (as of 1996).&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poinar|first=H. N.|author2=Hoss, M. |author3=Bada, J.

=== Mitochondrial DNA vs. nuclear DNA ===
[[File:Mitochondrial DNA versus Nuclear DNA.gif|thumb|300px|alt=An infographic contrasting inheritance of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA|Unlike nuclear DNA (left), mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the maternal lineage (right).]]
[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is separate from one's nuclear DNA. It is present in [[organelle]]s called [[mitochondria]] in each [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Unlike [[nuclear DNA]], which is inherited from both parents and rearranged every generation, an exact copy of mitochondrial DNA gets passed down from mother to her sons and daughters. The benefits of performing DNA analysis with Mitochondrial DNA is that it has a far smaller mutation rate than nuclear DNA, making tracking lineages on the scale of tens of thousands of years much easier. Knowing the base mutation rate for mtDNA,&lt;ref name=Henn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henn|first=B. M.|author2=Gignoux, C. R. |author3=Feldman, M. W. |author4= Mountain, J. L. |title=Characterizing the Time Dependency of Human Mitochondrial DNA Mutation Rate Estimates|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=6 October 2008|volume=26|issue=1|pages=217–230|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn244|pmid=18984905}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in humans this rate is also known as the [[Human mitochondrial molecular clock]]) one can determine the amount of time any two lineages have been separated. Another advantage of mtDNA is that thousands of copies of it exist in every cell, whereas only two copies of nuclear DNA exist in each cell.&lt;ref name=NFSTC&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitochondrial DNA|url=http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject09/pdi_s09_m02_01.htm|work=DNA Analyst Training|publisher=NFSTC Science Serving Justice|accessdate=23 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201220124/http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject09/pdi_s09_m02_01.htm|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All [[eukaryote]]s, a group which includes all plants, animals, and fungi, have mtDNA.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=BF|author2=Gray, MW |author3=Burger, G |title=Mitochondrial genome evolution and the origin of eukaryotes.|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|year=1999|volume=33|pages=351–97|pmid=10690412|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A disadvantage of mtDNA is that only the maternal line is represented. For example, a child will inherit 1/8 of its DNA from each of its eight great-grandparents, however it will inherit an exact clone of its maternal great-grandmother's mtDNA. This is analogous to a child inheriting only his paternal great-grandfather's last name, and not a mix of all of the eight surnames.

===Isolation===
There are many things to consider when [[Protein purification|isolating]] a substance. First, depending upon what it is and where it is located, there are protocols that must be carried out in order to avoid contamination and further degradation of the sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt; Then, handling of the materials is usually done in a physically isolated work area and under specific conditions (i.e. specific Temperature, moisture, etc...) also to avoid contamination and further loss of sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;

Once the material has been obtained, depending on what it is, there are different ways to isolate and purify it. [[Ancient DNA|DNA extraction from fossils]] is one of the more popular practices and there are different steps that can be taken to get the desired sample.&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;  DNA extracted from amber-entombed [[fossils]] can be taken from small samples and mixed with different substances, [[centrifugation|centrifuged]], incubated, and centrifuged again.&lt;ref name="Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR." /&gt;  On the other hand, DNA extraction from insects can be done by grinding the sample, mixing it with buffer, and undergoing [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] through glass fiber columns.&lt;ref name="DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tagliavia|first=Marcello|author2=Massa, Bruno |author3=Albanese, Ida |author4= La Farina, Mario |title=DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens|journal=Analytical Letters|date=29 March 2011|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1058–1062|doi=10.1080/00032719.2010.506939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, regardless of how the sample was isolated for these fossils, the DNA isolated must be able to undergo [[Gene duplication#Gene duplication as amplification|amplification]].&lt;ref name="Molecular Palaeontology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cano|first=RJ|author2=Poinar, HN|title=Rapid isolation of DNA from fossil and museum specimens suitable for PCR.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Sep 1993|volume=15|issue=3|pages=432–4, 436|pmid=8217155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA Extraction From Orthoptera Museum Specimens" /&gt;

===Amplification===
[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|thumb|alt=An infographic showing the replication process of PCR | Polymerase chain reaction]]

The field of molecular paleontology benefited greatly from the invention of the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction(PCR)]], which allows one to make billions of copies of a DNA fragment from just a single preserved copy of the DNA. One of the biggest challenges up until this point was the extreme scarcity of recovered DNA because of degradation of the DNA over time.&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;

===Sequencing===
[[DNA sequencing]] is done to determine the order of nucleotides and genes.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Blair Hodges |author2=Mary H. Schweitzer |title=Molecular Paleontology|publisher=Encyclopedia of Paleontology|pages=752–754|url=http://www.hedgeslab.org/pubs/116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different materials from which DNA can be extracted. In animals, the mitochondrial chromosome can be used for molecular study. [[Chloroplasts]] can be studied in plants as a primary source of sequence data.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;

[[File:An evolutionary tree of mammals.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=An evolutionary tree of mammals |An evolutionary tree of mammals]]
In the end, the sequences generated are used to build [[evolutionary trees]].&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;  Methods to match data sets include: [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum probability]], [[neighbor-joining|minimum evolution]] (also known as [[neighbor-joining]]) which searches for the tree with shortest overall length, and the [[maximum parsimony]] method which finds the tree requiring the fewest character-state changes.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;  The groups of species defined within a tree can also be later evaluated by statistical tests, such as the [[bootstrap method]], to see if they are indeed significant.&lt;ref name="Molecular Paleontology" /&gt;

==Limitations and challenges==
Ideal environmental conditions for preserving DNA where the organism was desiccated and uncovered are difficult to come by, as well as maintaining their condition until analysis. Nuclear DNA normally degrades rapidly after death by [[Endogeny|endogenous]] [[Hydrolytic|hydrolytic processes]],&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization" /&gt;  by UV radiation,&lt;ref name=Marota /&gt;  and other environmental stressors.

Also, interactions with the organic breakdown products of surrounding soil have been found to help preserve biomolecular materials.&lt;ref name=Tuross&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuross|first=N|title=The biochemistry of ancient DNA in bone|publisher=Experientia|pages=50:530–535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they have also created the additional challenge of being able to separate the various components in order to be able to conduct the proper analysis on them.&lt;ref name="Ancient proteins in fossil bones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuross|first=N|author2=Stathoplos, L|title=Ancient proteins in fossil bones|journal=Methods in Enzymology|date=1993|volume=224|pages=121–129|doi=10.1016/0076-6879(93)24010-r}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these breakdowns have also been found to interfere with the action of some of the enzymes used during PCR.&lt;ref name=Tuross /&gt;

Finally, one of the largest challenge in extracting ancient DNA, particularly in ancient human DNA, is in contamination during PCR. Small amounts of human DNA can contaminate the reagents used for extraction and PCR of ancient DNA. These problems can be overcome by rigorous care in the handling of all solutions as well as the glassware and other tools used in the process. It can also help if only one person performs the extractions, to minimize different types of DNA present.&lt;ref name="Paabo 1996 Racemization" /&gt;

'''Mughal Tahakhana''' ''or'' '''Shah Shuja Tahakhana''' is a three storied building known as ''Tahakhana''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd/upazilla_tourist_spot |title=উপজেলার দর্শনীয় স্থান &amp;#124; Shibganj Upazilla &amp;#124; শিবগঞ্জ উপজেলা |website=Shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{lang-bn|তাহখানা}}, [[Persian Language|Persian]]: تاهخانا {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɑː|h|ɑː|k|ɑː|n|ɑː}})'', means cold building or palace. The historical Tahakhana is located at the [[Gauḍa (region)]] in Firozpur area in the west of a big pond. It is 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chapai Nawabganj District]] in Shahbajpur Union at [[Shibganj Upazila, Chapai Nawabganj|Shibganj Upazila]].&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin, Mohammad (6 March 2010)। "শাহ নিয়ামতুল্লাহ (রঃ) এর মাজার"। ''গৌড়বঙ্গ ও চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ এর প্রাচীন নিদর্শন'' (2 সংস্করণ)। ঢাকা, বাংলাদেশ: জাতীয় সাহিত্য পরিষদ। পৃ:&amp;nbsp;১০১।&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sultan of Bengal]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] founded this palace as a 'Temperature Control Unit' in honour of his [[Murshed]] Shah Syed Niyamatullah, mainly for comfort in winter. Son of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]], Shah Shuja founded this palace between 1619 and 1658 (or 1639–1660).&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Rajinikanth (January 1999)। [http://50.30.47.15/ebook/bangla/Gourer_Itihas.pdf ''গৌড়ের ইতিহাস''] (PDF) (1 &amp; 2 সংস্করণ)। Bankim Chatterjee Street, Calcutta 700 073: Dev's Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; There is a saying that, when he came to meet with [[Murshed]] used the middle wider room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shahabajpurup.chapainawabganj.gov.bd "সোনামসজিদ তোহাখানা মাজার শরিফ"]। মন্ত্রিপরিষদ বিভাগ, এটুআই, বিসিসি ও বেসিস&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of unknown graves inside the 'Tahakhana Complex' considered as companions or Khadems of Shah Syed Niyamatullah.

== Structure ==
Ancient architecture like [[Gauḍa (region)|Gauḍa]] is rarely found except Tahakhana. Her ceiling and partition are coagulated on the beam by concrete casting. The Mosque and Tahakhana are on the lake name 'Dafe-ul-Balah'. Two stare cases are sank into the lake. Two more structures are on the north west side of the palace, nearer one is a three domed mosque and another one is one domed tomb with bolted veranda. All the buildings are founded by the same time for a specific purpose and considered as a complex unit. Main materiel of the building is brick. Black stone is used for the threshold and wooden vim used for plain roof. The building seems to be single storied from the west side but assumed double storied from the east side, extended by the rooms directly raised the archway from the lake. A [[Turkish bath|hammam]] is in the west of the building supplied water from an octagonal reservoir. A small family mosque is in the north and at its back side an open room which connected with an octagonal tower. This tower possibly used for [[contemplation]]. This octagonal tower balanced the complex. The palace is plastered and engraved by the crafts following [[Mughal architecture]].

'''Music notation''' or '''musical notation''' is any system used to visually represent [[wikt:aurally|aurally]] perceived [[music]] played with [[instrument (music)|instruments]] or [[singing|sung]] by the [[human voice]] through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols.

Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional [[classical music]] performers, [[sheet music]] using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s, the [[Nashville Number System]] is the main method.

The symbols used include ancient symbols and [[modern musical symbols|modern symbols]] made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone, made in [[clay tablet]]s, made using a pen on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] or [[manuscript paper]]; printed using a [[printing press]] (ca. 1400s), a [[computer printer]] (ca. 1980s) or other [[Music engraving|printing]] or [[Photocopier|modern copying technology]].

Although many ancient cultures used symbols to represent [[melody|melodies]] and [[rhythm]]s, none of them were particularly comprehensive, and this has limited today's understanding of their music. The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in [[Medieval music|medieval]] Europe, starting with the [[Catholic church|Catholic Church]]'s goal for ecclesiastical uniformity.  The church began notating [[plainchant]] melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church. Music notation developed further in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]] eras. In the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] (1750–1820) and the [[Romantic music era]] (1820–1900), notation continued to develop as new [[music technology (mechanical)|musical instrument technologies]] were developed. In the [[contemporary classical music]] of the 20th and 21st century, music notation has continued to develop, with the introduction of [[graphical notation (music)|graphical notation]] by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based [[scorewriter|score writer]] programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, [[popular music]], and [[traditional music]].

==History==

===Ancient Near East===
{{further|Music of Mesopotamia|Hurrian songs}}
[[File:Hurritische hymne.gif|right|frame|A drawing of one side of the tablet on which the Hymn to Nikkal is inscribed&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati, "[http://128.97.6.202/urkeshpublic/music.htm Hurrian Music]", associate editor and webmaster Federico A. Buccellati Urkesh website (n.p.: IIMAS, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]), in about 1400 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer &amp; Civil 1986,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer 1965,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994a"&gt;West 1994, 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994b"&gt;West 1994, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
{{further|Musical system of ancient Greece}}

[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

Three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. The [[Delphic Hymns]], dated to the 2nd century BC, also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{further|Byzantine music}}
[[File:Stavropoleos-anastasimatar-macarie-viena-1823-p11.png|thumb|right|250px|Byzantine music notation style in a Romanian ''anastasimatarion'', a "Book of Hymns at the Lord's Resurrection", 1823]]

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] music has mainly survived as music for court ceremonies, including vocal religious music. It is not known if it is based on the [[monody|monodic]] [[Musical mode#Greek scales|modal]] singing and instrumental music of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek theoretical categories played a key role to understand and transmit Byzantine music, especially the tradition of Damascus had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic [[Near East]] comparable to [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]].

Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key ([[Enechema|modal signatures]] which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the [[echos]]. Despite [[ekphonetic notation]] further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Today we can only the study the evolution of notation within Greek monastic chant books like those of the [[Sticheron|sticherarion]] and  the [[Irmologion|heirmologion]], while there is no authentic asmatikon and kontakarion of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. The earliest books which have survived, are in Slavonic translation which already show an own notation system (see [[#Russia|Russia]]) used in [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] and [[Ohrid|Macedonia]] during the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the [[Cantor (Christianity)|choirleaders]], which existed once as part of an oral tradition.

Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are ''differential'' rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant.  These step symbols themselves, or better "phonic neumes", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called ''gántzoi'' ("hooks") in [[Modern Greek]].

Notes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as an optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added, if necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another echos.

The so-called "great signs" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a [[semitone]]), both essential in Byzantine chant.&lt;ref&gt;See Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]]) for a historical discussion of the great signs and their modern interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChrysanthosTable.png|thumb|400px|center|Chrysanthos' ''Kanonion'' with a comparison between Ancient Greek tetraphonia (column 1), Western [[Solfeggio]], the ''Papadic Parallage'' (ascending: column 3 and 4; descending: column 5 and 6) according to the ''trochos system'', and his heptaphonic ''parallage'' according to the New Method (syllables in the fore-last and ''martyriai'' in the last column) ([[#Chr1832|1832, p. 33]])]]

Since [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] there are seven standard note names used for "solfège" (''parallagē'') ''pá, vú, g&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;á, d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ē, ké, zō, nē'', while the older practice still used the four enechemata or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or "kyrioi" in ascending direction, and the plagal or "plagioi" in descending direction ([[Papadic Octoechos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]]) made a difference between his monosyllabic and the traditional polysyllabic ''parallage.''&lt;/ref&gt; With exception of ''vú and zō'' they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as ''re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do''.  Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by ''Ēkhoi'', "sounds", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular ''Ēkhos'' used.  Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches.  Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and "sliding" into the natural scales from experience, but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos a lot of details are only known from an oral tradition related to traditional masters and their experience.

===13th-century Near East===
In 1252, [[Safi al-Din al-Urmawi]] developed a form of musical notation, where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toussaint|2004|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Europe===
{{Main|Neume}}

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]
The scholar and music theorist [[Isidore of Seville]], while writing in the early 7th century, considered that "unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville 2006, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a [[mnemonic]] device for [[Gregorian chant]], using symbols known as [[neume]]s; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the ''Musica disciplina'' of [[Aurelian of Réôme]], from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] before this time, of a type of notation known as [[Neume|Visigothic neumes]], but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Zapke 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--A complex issue, to be sure, but this book has 480 pages. Surely it does not take that long to demonstrate that nothing at all has been deciphered.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.

[[File:EarlyMusicNotation.JPG|250px|thumb|Early music notation]]

Notation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'', explains a set of six [[rhythmic modes]] that were in use at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 2002, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] and summarised as part of his treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (the art of measured chant, or [[mensural notation]]). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The founder of what is now considered the standard music stave was [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]],&lt;ref name="Catholic encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07065a.htm Otten 1910].&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of [[solmization]] syllables based on a hymn to [[Saint John the Baptist]], which begins [[Ut Queant Laxis]] and was written by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]]. The first stanza is:

# '''Ut''' queant laxis
# '''re'''sonare fibris,
# '''Mi'''ra gestorum
# '''fa'''muli tuorum,
# '''Sol'''ve polluti
# '''la'''bii reatum,
# '''S'''ancte '''I'''ohannes.

Guido used the first syllable of each line, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si, to read notated music in terms of [[Guidonian hand#Hexachord in Middle Ages|hexachords]]; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, Ut was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, "open" syllable Do, said to have been taken from the name of the Italian theorist [[Giovanni Battista Doni]],
but rather Do have been taken from the word "Dominus" in Latin with the meaning "the Lord". &lt;ref&gt;McNaught 1893, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, Neitz, and Battani 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1994|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern staff notation==
{{Main|List of musical symbols}}

[[File:Chopin Prelude 7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of modern musical notation: Prelude, Op. 28, No. 7, by [[Frédéric Chopin]] {{audio|Chopin Prelude 7.mid|Play}}]]

Modern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff acts as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing round [[Musical note|note]]s on the staff lines or between the lines. The pitch of the round musical notes can be modified by [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The duration (note length) is shown with different [[note value]]s, which can be indicated by the note being just a circle (a [[whole note]]) or using stems to indicate [[quarter note]]s and other subdivisions, and additional symbols such as [[dotted note|dots]] and [[Tie (music)|ties]] which lengthen the duration of a note. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult.

A staff (or stave, in British English) of written music generally begins with a [[clef]], which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The [[treble clef]] or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The [[bass clef]] or F clef shows the position of the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the [[alto clef]] (used for [[viola]] and [[alto trombone]] music) and the [[tenor clef]] (used for some [[cello]] and [[double bass]] music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using [[ledger line]]s, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use [[treble clef]] and [[double bass]] and [[tuba]], which use [[bass clef]]. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as [[piano]] and [[pipe organ]].

Following the clef, the [[key signature]] on a staff indicates the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are flat or sharp throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] added before certain notes. When a sharp is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone higher. When a flat is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone lower. [[Double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher. A double flat is placed before a note to make it two semitones lower. A [[natural sign]] placed before a note renders that note in its "natural" form, which means that any sharps or flats applying to that note from the key signature or from accidentals are cancelled. Sometimes a [[courtesy accidental]] is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch the key signature requires.

Following the key signature is the [[time signature]]. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being "4/4". The top "4" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called [[Bar (music)|bar]]). The bottom "4" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of [[beat (music)|beats]], and the time signatures specify those groupings. "4/4" is used so often that it is also called "[[common time]]", and it may be indicated with a "C" rather than numbers. Other common time signatures are "3/4" (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "2/4" (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "6/8" (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and "12/8" (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. "12/8" is a [[compound time]] type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as "3/8", "5/8", "5/4", "7/4", "9/8", and so on.

Many short [[classical music]] pieces from the [[classical period (music)|classical era]] and songs from [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the [[Romantic music]] era and later, particularly [[contemporary classical music]] and [[rock music]] genres such as [[progressive rock]] and the [[hardcore punk]] subgenre [[mathcore]], may use [[mixed meter]]; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of "5/4" and "7/8".

Directions to the player regarding matters such as [[tempo]] (e.g., [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]], [[Tempo#French tempo markings|Vif, Lent, Modérément]], [[Presto (music)|Presto]], etc.), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (pianississimo, pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo, fortississimo, etc.) appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the [[musical expression]] or "feel" to a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., "Slow March", "Fast Swing", "Medium Blues", "Fougueux", "Feierlich", "Gelassen", "Piacevole", "Con slancio", "Majestic", "Hostile" etc.) For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), [[retake]]s (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.

In music for [[musical ensemble|ensembles]], a "[[sheet music|score]]" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score while she leads an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], [[choir]] or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from  "parts" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of [[scorewriter]] computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using a computer printer. 

A [[Flat (music)|♭]] in music lowers a pitch down one semitone. A [[Sharp (music)|♯]] in music raises a note one semitone. For example, a sharp on B would raise it do B♯ while a flat would lower it to B♭.

===Variations on staff notation===
[[File:Lead-sheet-wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|A lead sheet]]
[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|250px|A chord chart. {{audio|Chord chart.mid|Play}}]]
* [[Percussion notation]] conventions are varied because of the wide range of percussion instruments. Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched (e.g., [[glockenspiel]] or [[tubular bells]]) and non-pitched (e.g., [[bass drum]] and [[snare drum]]). The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized. Pitched instruments use standard Western classical notation for the pitches and rhythms. In general, notation for unpitched percussion uses the five line staff, with different lines and spaces representing different [[drum kit]] instruments. Standard Western rhythmic notation is used to indicate the rhythm.
* [[Figured bass]] notation originated in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] parts. It is also used extensively in [[accordion]] notation. The bass notes of the music are conventionally notated, along with numbers and other signs that determine which chords the harpsichordist, organist or lutenist should improvise. It does not, however, specify the exact pitches of the harmony, leaving that for the performer to improvise.
* A [[lead sheet]] specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] placed above and lyrics below. It is used to capture the essential elements of a [[popular music|popular song]] without specifying how the song should be arranged or performed.
* A [[chord chart]] or "chart" contains little or no melodic information at all but provides detailed harmonic information about the [[chord progression]]. Some chord charts also contain rhythmic information, indicated using slash notation for full beats and rhythmic notation for rhythms. This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[List of popular music genres|popular music]] and is intended primarily for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[drum]]s).
* Simpler chord charts for songs may contain only the chord changes, placed above the lyrics where they occur. Such charts depend on prior knowledge of the melody, and are used as reminders in performance or informal [[group singing]]. Some chord charts intended for [[rhythm section]] accompanists contain only the chord progression.
* The [[shape note]] system is found in some church hymnals, [[sheet music]], and song books, especially in the [[Southern United States]]. Instead of the customary elliptical note head, note heads of various shapes are used to show the position of the note on the major scale. [[Sacred Harp]] is one of the most popular tune books using shape notes.

==In various countries==

===Korea===
[[File:시용향악보 (時用鄕樂譜).jpg|200px|thumb|''Jeongganbo musical notation system'']]
''Jeongganbo'' is a unique traditional musical notation system created during the time of [[Sejong the Great]] that was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanadesikan 2011, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gukak|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/251893/1|website=The DONG-A ILBO|publisher=dongA.com|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, Jeong-gan-bo targets a particular genre, Jeong-ak (정악, 正樂).

Jeong-gan-bo tells the pitch by writing the pitch's name down in a box called 'jeong-gan' (this is where the name comes from). One jeong-gan is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats and quarter beats, and more. This makes it easy for the reader to figure out the beat.

Also, there are lots of markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.

===India===
{{Main|Swaralipi}}
[[File:Bhat notation1.jpg|thumb|350px|Indian music, early 20th century.]]
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').

Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa).

Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

Other systems exist for non-twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] and non-Western music, such as the Indian ''[[Swaralipi]]''.

{{further|Znamenny chant}}
[[Image:Example of hooks and banners notation.PNG|thumb|200px|right|An example of Znamenny notation with so-called "red marks", Russia, 1884. "Thy [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross]] we honour, oh Lord, and Thy holy Resurrection we praise."]]
[[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|160px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]] 
Znamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]] which uses a "hook and banner" notation. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|крюки|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|знамёна|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness.{{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}} There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.

Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znamëna'' (Russian for "marks", "banners") or ''Kryuki'' ("hooks"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.

The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called "little dove" (Russian: голубчик ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese musical notation}}

[[File:Qinnotation.png|thumb|250px|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm Bagley 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609090628/http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm |date=9 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gongche notation]] used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.

[[File:Tempyo Biwa Fu.jpg|thumb|''Tempyō Biwa Fu'' 天平琵琶譜 (circa 738 AD), musical notation for [[Biwa]]. ([[Shōsōin]], at Nara, Japan)]]
Japanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas [[taiko]] notation focuses on discrete strokes.

[[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyuan]] [[sanshin]] music uses [[kunkunshi]], a notation system of [[kanji]] with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.

===Indonesia===&lt;!--[[Kepatihan notation]]'s see also links here--&gt;
{{Main|Gamelan notation}}

Notation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]. However, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations ("not angka" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with some subset of the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either highest note of a particular octave, as in [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]] [[gamelan]], or lowest, as in the [[kepatihan notation]] of [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]].

Notes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below the each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the [[balungan]]) and vocal parts ([[gerong]]an), although transcriptions of the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.

The symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in [[Yogyakarta]] a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of [[Gamelan gender wayang]] pieces, employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.

Composers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The Dutch composer [[Ton de Leeuw]] also invented a three line staff for his composition ''Gending''. However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scale]] cipher notation has become common for notating western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a "fixed Do" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is "moveable-Do" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, "1=C").

==Other systems and practices==

===Pitch bracket notation===
In pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket (i.e. angle bracket), determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation. Musical variations can be mathematically generated from their themes.

===Cipher notation===
{{Main|Numbered musical notation}}
Cipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the [[major scale]] degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as ''[[Siffernotskrift]]''. The one most widely in use today is the Chinese ''Jianpu'', discussed in the [[Numbered musical notation|main article]]. Numerals can of course also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese ''[[kepatihan]]'' notation [[Musical notation#Indonesia|described above]].

===Solfège===
{{Main|Solfège}}
Solfège is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do{{'}}'' (for the octave). The classic variation is: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do{{'}}''. The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by [[Guido of Arezzo]] (c. 991 &amp;ndash; after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn [[Ut queant laxis]]. The original sequence was ''Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La'', where each verse started a scale note higher. "Ut" later became "Do". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni''. See also: [[solfège]], [[swara|sargam]], [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Kodály hand signs]].

[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfège.

===Letter notation===
{{Main|Letter notation}}
The notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A–G, possibly with a trailing sharp or flat symbol, such as A{{music|sharp}} or B{{Music|flat}}.

===Tablature===
{{Main|Tablature}}
Tablature was first used in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] for organ music and later in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] for [[lute]] music.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1961, xxiii and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The [[fret]]s to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular [[guitar]] music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in [[ASCII tab|ASCII format]]. Websites like [[Tablature#OLGA.net|OLGA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olga.net/ olga.net]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have archives of text-based popular music tablature.

===Klavar notation===
{{Main|Klavarskribo}}
Klavarskribo (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.

===Piano-roll-based notations===
Some chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The "staff" is most widely referred to as "piano roll", created by extending the black and white piano keys.

===Chromatic staff notations===
Over the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a "chromatic staff" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the ''Ailler-Brennink'' notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's ''Dodeka'' music notation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodeka.info/ dodeka.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicnotation.org/systems/more-notation-systems/|title=More Notation Systems {{!}} Notation Systems {{!}} The Music Notation Project|website=musicnotation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tom Reed's ''Twinline'' notation, Russell Ambrose's ''Ambrose Piano Tabs'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambrosepianotabs.com/ ambrosepianotabs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Morris' ''Clairnote'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://clairnote.org/ clairnote.org]&lt;/ref&gt; John Keller's ''Express Stave'', and José A. Sotorrio's ''Bilinear Music Notation''. These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicnotation.org musicnotation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic notation===
{{Main|Graphic notation (music)}}
The term 'graphic notation' refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Practitioners include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], and [[Roger Reynolds]]. See ''Notations'', edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles, {{ISBN|0-685-14864-5}}.

===Simplified music notation===
{{Main|Simplified music notation}}
[[Simplified Music Notation]] is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make [[sight reading|sight-reading]] easier. It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but incorporates [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] into the shape of the [[note heads]]. [[Musical note|Note]]s such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]] are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] they are actually played at, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called ''history signs'' that show they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].

===Modified Stave Notation===
{{Main|Modified Stave Notation}}
[[Modified Stave Notation]] (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.

===Parsons code===
{{Main|Parsons code}}
Parsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.

===Braille music===
{{Main|Braille music}}
Braille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree Braille music resembles musical markup languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmarkup.info/scope/markuplanguages.html musicmarkup.info]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MusicXML]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ emusician.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701200951/http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Notation Interchange File Format|NIFF]].

===Integer notation===
In [[integer notation]], or the [[integer]] model of pitch, all [[pitch class]]es and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.

===Rap notation===
The standard form of rap notation is the "flow diagram", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath "beat numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2009, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books ''How to Rap'' and ''How to Rap 2'' extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2013, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book ''Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity''&lt;ref&gt;Krims 2001, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat,&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"&gt;Edwards 2009, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"/&gt;

==Music notation on computer==
{{Main|Scorewriter}}

Many computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called ''scorewriters'' or ''music notation software''). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.

==Perspectives of musical notation in composition and musical performance==
According to Philip Tagg and [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a 'notational centricity', a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg 1979, 28–32; Middleton 1990, 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation.{{Clarify|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--How does changing the style of notation encourage musicologists to ignore notation in favor of other approaches, such as recordings or spectrograms?--&gt; These include [[George Crumb]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Krzystof Penderecki]], [[Earle Brown|Earl Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce 1973, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan 1976, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">The '''National Sexuality Resource Center''' ('''NSRC''') is a [[San Francisco]]-based organization which advocates the positive representation of [[human sexuality]], creates educational content, and provides training about human sexuality. The center also counters what it views as negative representations of sexuality while fostering dialog of sexuality issues as a natural part of being human. 

NSRC opened in 2003 and is directed by [[Gilbert Herdt]], an [[anthropologist]] who pioneered the cross-cultural study of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Adam. "California center opens with pledge to tell all about sex", [[Reuters]]. Reprinted in ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', February 23, 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (February 21, 2003). "Center aims to end myths about sex", ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', p. A5.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored ''Guardians of the Flute'', an examination of sexual rituals in [[New Guinea]]. The center is affiliated with [[San Francisco State University]] and is supported through the [[Ford Foundation]]’s Global Dialogue on Sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Hubler, Shawn (May 15, 2005). "When XXX becomes ZZZ: Just the facts of life", ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', p. D3.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSRC activities have included an Internet-based "sexual literacy campaign" called SexLiteracy.org, the University Consortium for Sexuality Research and Training, an annual Summer Institute, and the Sexual Health Literacy Project in partnership with [[College of the Redwoods]] in Eureka, California.&lt;ref&gt;Leff, Lisa (June 20, 2005). "Researchers aim to educate citizens about sex matters", ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', p. A6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (June 20, 2005). "Researchers: Sex education necessary, not disgusting", ''[[Telegraph Herald]]'', p. A7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorow, Stephanie (February 18, 2005). "Sex survey questions reveal sites' positions", ''[[Boston Herald]]'', p. E29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, NSRC hosted the first annual Champions of Sexual Literacy Awards commemorating former Surgeon General [[David Satcher]]’s call to action on [[sexual health]] and "responsible sexual behavior". Awardees were [[MTV|thinkMTV]], actor [[BD Wong]], former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders]], Bernard Goldstein, and Anke Ehrhardt of the [[HIV]] Center at Columbia University.

NSRC publishes the journal ''[[Sexuality Research and Social Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Wyatt (March 1, 2006). "The battle over same-sex marriage", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', p. B10.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has also published the magazine ''American Sexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Beth (November 14, 2004). "How to safely narrow the hunt for sex research", ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', p. E2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES)''' is a research network for environmental studies based primarily in the humanities. By organizing regular conferences, symposia and workshops, NIES aims to create opportunities for researchers in the [[Nordic countries]] who address environmental questions to exchange ideas and develop their work in various interdisciplinary contexts. Fields represented by members of the network include [[Ecocriticism]], [[Environmental history]], [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[Art history]], [[Media studies]], [[Ecological economics]], [[Human Geography]], [[Cultural studies]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archeology]], [[Sustainability Studies]], [[Education for Sustainability]] and [[Landscape Studies]].

NIES is responsible for organizing and editing the research series '''''Studies in the Environmental Humanities (SEH)''''' published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

Formed in 2007, NIES was originally a cooperation among small academic groups in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Today, it includes more than 100 researchers from all the [[Nordic countries]].  The network actively sponsors a wide range of educational initiatives, research projects and public outreach activities and is a key partner in pan-European and other international initiatives to build capacity and foster theoretical advancement in the Environmental Humanities. Since January 2011, the network's primary anchoring institution is Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. National anchoring institutions include University of Turku, University of Oslo, University of Iceland, Uppsala University and University of Southern Denmark. The network's current phase of operations (2011–2015) is supported by NordForsk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">'''Normal science''', identified  and elaborated on by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; is the  regular work of [[scientists]] theorizing, observing, and experimenting within a settled [[paradigm]] or explanatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding [[science]] as puzzle-solving,&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970) p. 35-42&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad [[theory]], without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory.

==The route to normal science==
Kuhn stressed that historically the route to normal science could be a difficult one.  Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would-be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] or [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p.  10-22&lt;/ref&gt; while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories.

Arguably at least the [[social sciences]] remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rosenberg, ''Philosophy of Science'' (2005) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normal science at work==
Kuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the 'normal' scientist, as they engaged with the threefold tasks of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 25-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The breakdown of consensus==
For the normal scientist anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved ''within'' the paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge, and perhaps be subjected to a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 52-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound [[research]], whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Karl Popper]] has criticised Kuhn's view of normal science as excessively conservative and dogmatic&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Bernstein, ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism'' (2011) p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;—though whether Kuhn is prescriptive or merely descriptive here is open to doubt. Popper, [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and [[John W. N. Watkins|Watkins]] have also questioned whether the contrast between normal science versus revolutionary science is as stark as portrayed by Kuhn.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Official statistics''' are [[statistics]] published by [[Government|government agencies]] or other public bodies such as international organizations as a [[public good]]. They provide quantitative or qualitative information on all major areas of citizens' lives, such as economic and social development,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Economic and development statistics" http://www.un.org/esa/progareas/stats.html&lt;/ref&gt; living conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat-"Comparative EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions: Issues and Challenges" http://www.stat.fi/eusilc/index_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[health]],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "World Health Statistics 2008". http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. "Global Education Digest 2007". http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=7167_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC&lt;/ref&gt; and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Statistical Commission. "Environment statistics" http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/stacom_archive/brochures/for%20web/Brochure%20-%20Environment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, statistics were a method for counting and listing populations and State resources. The term ''statistics'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''statisticum collegium'' (council of state) and refers to ''science of the state''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ball|first1 = Philip|title = Critical Mass|publisher =  Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year = 2004|isbn=0-374-53041-6|page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], official statistics are statistics disseminated by the national statistical system, excepting those that are explicitly not to be official".&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Online Glossary of Statistical Terms http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental agencies at all levels, including municipal, [[county]], and state administrations, may generate and disseminate official statistics.  This broader possibility is accommodated by later definitions. For example:
{{quote|Almost every country in the world has one or more government agencies (usually national institutes) that supply decision-makers and other users including the general public and the research community with a continuing flow of information (...). This bulk of data is usually called official statistics. Official statistics should be objective and easily accessible and produced on a continuing basis so that measurement of change is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Biemer, Paul and Lyberg Lars (2003).''Introduction to Survey Quality'', Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-19375-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Official statistics result from the ''collection and processing of data'' into statistical information by a government institution or international organisation. They are then disseminated to help users develop their knowledge about a particular topic or geographical area, make comparisons between countries or understand changes over time. Official statistics make information on economic and social development accessible to the public, allowing the impact of government policies to be assessed, thus improving accountability.

==Aim==
Official statistics provide a picture of a country or different phenomena through data, and images such as [[chart|graph]] and [[map]]s. Statistical information covers different subject areas ([[economic]], [[demographic]], [[social]] etc.). It provides basic information for [[decision making]], evaluations and assessments at different levels.

The goal of statistical organizations is to produce relevant, objective and accurate&lt;ref&gt;See Point 3 in Assessment of the quality in statistics - Eurostat
http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2000/11/metis/crp.2.e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; statistics to keep users well informed and assist good policy and decision-making.

==Various categories==
''The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics'' were adopted in 1992 by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], and subsequently endorsed as a global standard by the United Nations Statistical Commission.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first Principle "Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics http://www.unece.org/stats/archive/docs.fp.e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The categorization of the domains of official statistics has been further developed in the Classification of Statistical Activities, endorsed by the Conference of European Statisticians and various other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/disaarchive/Classification+of+Statistical+Activities Classification of Statistical Activities]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most common indicators used in official statistics==
Statistical indicators provide an overview of the social, demographic and economic structure of society. Moreover, these indicators facilitate comparisons between countries and regions.

For '''population''', the main indicators are:
* Total population
* Population density
* Population by age
* [[Life expectancy]] at birth and at age 65
* [[Foreign born]]
* Foreigners in population
* [[Total fertility rate]]
* [[Infant mortality]]

The '''gender''' statistics include:
* Women in labour force
* [[Gender pay gap]]&lt;ref&gt;See The gender pay gap - European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2006/101/en/1/ef06101en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''employment''' category:
* [[Employment rate]]
* [[Unemployment rate]]
* Youth unemployment rate
* [[Economic activity rate]] (women and men)
* [[Holland Codes|Employment in major sectors]]: agriculture, industry, services

There are many indicators for the '''economy''':
* [[Gross Domestic Product]]
* Gross Domestic Product per capita
* Real GDP growth rate
* GDP by major economic sectors: agriculture, industry, services
* [[Consumer price index]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/guides/cpi/index.htm|title=Working Group and Expert Group on the Revision of the CPI Manual|work=ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Purchasing Power Parity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/ICPEXT/0,,menuPK:1973757~pagePK:62002243~piPK:62002387~theSitePK:270065,00.html|title=International Comparison Program|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Exchange rate]]
* Gross external debt

For '''trade''' indicators we find:
* Exports of goods and services
* Imports of goods and services
* [[Balance of payments]]&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter II Balance Payments Manual - IMF
 http://imf.org/external/np/sta/bop/BOPman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trade balance]]
* Major import partners
* Major export partners

'''Environment''' indicators:
* Land use
* Water supply and consumption
* [[Environmental protection expenditure accounts|Environmental protection expenditure]]
* Generation and treatment of waste
* Chemical use

For the '''energy''' field:
* Total energy consumption
* Primary energy sources
* Energy consumption in transport
* Electricity consumption
* Consumption of renewable energy sources

==Users==
[[File:User Types.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The three user types of official statistics]]
Official statistics are intended for a wide range of users including governments (central and local), research institutions, professional statisticians, journalists and the media, businesses, educational institutions and the general public.
There are '''three types of users''': those with a general interest, business interest or research interest. Each of these user groups has different needs for statistical information.

===Users with a general interest===
'''''Users with a general interest''''' include the media, schools and the general public. They use official statistics in order to be informed on a particular topic, to observe trends within the society of a local area, country, region of the world.

===Users with a business interest===
'''''Users with a business interest''''' include decision makers and users with a particular interest for which they want more detailed information. For them, official statistics are an important reference, providing information on the phenomena or circumstances their own work is focusing on. For instance, those users will take some official statistics into consideration before launching a product, or deciding on a specific policy or on a [[marketing strategy]]. As with the business interest users, this group does not usually have a good understanding of statistical methodologies, but they need more detailed information than the general users.

===Users with a research interest===
'''''Users with a research interest''''' are universities, consultants and [[government agencies]]. They generally understand something about statistical methodology and want to dig deeper into the facts and the statistical observations; they have an analytical purpose in inventing or explaining interrelations of causes and effects of different phenomena. In this field, official statistics are also used to assess a government's policies.

One common point for all these users is their need to be able to '''trust''' the official information. They need to be confident that the results published are authoritative and unbiased. Producers of official statistics must maintain a reputation of professionalism and independence.

The statistical system must be free from interference that could influence decisions on the choice of sources, methods used for '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data collection]''', the selection of results to be released as official, and the timing and form of '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc dissemination]'''. Statistical business processes should be transparent and follow [[international standards]] of good practice.

Statistical programs are decided on an annual or multi-annual basis by governments in many countries. They also provide a way to judge the performance of the statistical system.

==Producers at the national level==
{{see also|List of national and international statistical services}}

Official statistics are collected and produced by '''national statistical organisations''' (NSOs), or other organisations (e.g. central banks) that form part of the national statistical system in countries where statistical production is de-centralized. These organisations are responsible for producing and disseminating official statistical information, providing the highest quality data. Quality in the context of official statistics is a multi-faceted concept, consisting of components such as relevance, completeness, timeliness, accuracy, accessibility, clarity, cost-efficiency, transparency, comparability and coherence.

The core tasks of NSOs, for both centralized and decentralized systems, are determining user needs and filtering these for [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=relevance relevance]. Then they transform the relevant user needs into measurable concepts to facilitate data collection and dissemination. The NSO is in charge of the coordination between statistical producers and of ensuring the coherence and compliance of the statistical system to agreed standards. The NSO has a coordination responsibility as its President/Director General represents the entire national system of official statistics, both at the national and at international levels.

==Production process==
The production process of official statistics comprises 9 phases, as documented in the [http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/metis/The+Generic+Statistical+Business+Process+Model Generic Statistical Business Process Model]
* Specify Needs
* Design
* Build
* Collect
* Process
* Analyse
* Disseminate
* Archive
* Evaluate

==Data revision==
Even after they have been published, some official statistics may be revised. Policy-makers may need preliminary statistics quickly for decision-making purposes, but eventually it is important to publish the best available information, so official statistics are often published in several 'vintages'.

In order to understand the accuracy of economic data and the possible impact of data errors on macroeconomic decision-making, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] has published a dataset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/real-time-data/|title=Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists|work=philadelphiafed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; that records both initial real-time data estimates, and subsequent data revisions, for a large number of macroeconomic series. A similar dataset for Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabcn.org/eabcn-real-time-database|title=EABCN Real Time Database|work=eabcn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by the Euro-Area Business Cycle Network.

==Data Sources==
There are two sources of data for statistics. Primary, or "statistical" sources are data that are collected primarily for creating official statistics, and include statistical surveys and censuses. Secondary, or "non-statistical" sources, are data that have been primarily collected for some other purpose (administrative data, private sector data etc.).

===Statistical survey or sample survey===
A [[statistical survey]] or a [[sample survey]] is an investigation about the characteristics of a phenomenon by means of collecting data from a sample of the population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology.
** The main advantages are the direct control over data collection and the possibility to ask for data according to statistical definitions.
** Disadvantages include the high cost of data collection and the quality issues relating to [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc non-response] and survey errors.

There are various survey methods that can be used such as direct interviewing, telephone, mail, online surveys.

===Census===
A [[census]] is a complete enumeration of a population or groups at a point in time with respect to well-defined characteristics (population, production). Data are collected for a specific reference period. A [http://www.unece.org/stats/census/ census should be taken at regular intervals] in order to have comparable information available, therefore, most statistical censuses are conducted every 5 or 10 years. Data are usually collected through [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=questionnaire questionnaires] mailed to respondents, via the Internet, or completed by an [http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3029 enumerator] visiting respondents, or contacting them by telephone.
** An advantage is that censuses provide better data than surveys for small geographic areas or sub-groups of the population. Census data can also provide a basis for sampling frames used in subsequent surveys.
** The major disadvantage of censuses is usually the high cost associated with planning and conducting them, and processing the resulting data.

In 2005, the [https://www.un.org/ecosoc/ United Nations Economic and Social Council] adopted a resolution urging: "Member States to carry out a population and housing census and to disseminate census results as an essential source of information for small area, national, regional and international planning and development; and to provide census results to national stakeholders as well as the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations to assist in studies on population, environment, and socio-economic development issues and programs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/13, 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/docs/resolution_A_2005_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Register===
A register is a database that is updated continuously for a specific purpose and from which statistics can be collected and produced. It contains information on a complete group of units.
** An advantage is the ''total coverage'' even if collecting and processing represent ''low cost''. It allows producing more detailed statistics than using surveys. Different registers can be combined and linked together on the basis of defined keys (personal identification codes, business identification codes, address codes etc.). Moreover, individual administrative registers are usually of high quality and very detailed.
** A disadvantage is the ''possible under-coverage'' that can be the case if the incentive or the cultural tradition of registering events and changes are weak, if the classification principles of the register are not clearly defined or if the classifications do not correspond to the needs of statistical production to be derived from them.

There are different types of registers:

→'''''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc Administrative registers]'''''&lt;ref&gt;See Using a combination of administrative registers and sample surveys instead of
a census: dome general remarks and the situation in the Netherlands, A.H. Kroese
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb/attachments/2001NLD_Registers-
GUIDf2d2b48e535a481bb84b6b817a397066.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''records''''' can help the NSI in collecting data. Using the existing administrative data for statistical production may be approved by the public because it can be seen as a cost efficient method; individuals and enterprises are less harassed by a response burden; [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=data+security data security] is better as fewer people handle it and data have an electronic format.

→'''''Private registers''''' such as registers operated by insurance companies and employer organizations can also be used in the production process of official statistics, providing there is an agreement or legislation on this.

→'''''Statistical registers''''' are frequently based on combined data from different administrative registers or other data sources.

→For businesses, it is often legally indispensable to be registered in their country to a '''''business register''''' which is a system that makes business information collection easier.

→It is possible to find ''''' agricultural registers''''' and '''''registers of dwellings'''''.

Even though different types of data collection exist, the best estimates are based on a combination of different sources providing the strengths and reducing the weakness of each individual source.

==Official Statistics presentation==
Official statistics can be presented in different ways. Analytical texts and tables are the most traditional ways. '''Graphs''' and '''[[charts]]''' summarize data highlighting information content visually. They can be extremely effective in expressing key results, or illustrating a presentation. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Graphs and charts usually have a heading describing the topic.

There are different types of graphic but usually the data determine the type that is going to be used.
* To illustrate changes over time, a '''''[[line graph]]''''' would be recommended. This is usually used to display variables whose values represent a regular progression.
[[File:ECE_weekly_235.png|thumb|right|200px|Stacked bar chart showing the sectoral contribution to total business services growth, 2001-2005 for members of [[UNECE]].]]
* For categorical data, it is better to use a '''''[[bar graph]]''''' either vertical or horizontal. They are often used to represent percentages and rates and also to compare countries, groups or illustrate changes over time. The same variable can be plotted against itself for two groups. An example of this is the age pyramid.
* '''''[[Pie chart]]''''' can be used to represent share of 100 per cent. Pie charts highlight the topic well only when there are few segments.
* '''''[[Stacked bar chart]]s''''', whether vertical or horizontal, are used to compare compositions across categories. They can be used to compare percentage composition and are most effective for categories that add up to 100 per cent, which make a full stacked bar chart. Their use is usually restricted to a small number of categories.
* '''''Tables''''' are a complement to related texts and support the analysis. They help to minimize numbers in the description and also eliminate the need to discuss small variables that are not essential. Tables rank data by order or other hierarchies to make the numbers easily understandable. They usually show the figures from the highest to the lowest.
* Another type of visual presentation of statistical information is '''''[[thematic map]]'''''. They can be used to illustrate differences or similarities between geographical areas, regions or countries. The most common statistical map that is used is called the [[choropleth map]] where different shades of a colour are used to highlight contrasts between regions; darker colour means a greater statistical value. This type of map is best used for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16571685&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=ratio&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 ratio]&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph 4.5 in Data and Metadata reporting and Presentation Handbook -
OECD
http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/17/37671574.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; data but for other data, proportional or graduated symbol maps, such as circles, are preferred. The size of the symbol increases in proportion to the value of the observed object.

==Release==
Official statistics are part of our everyday life. They are everywhere: in newspapers, on television and radio, in presentations and discussions. For most citizens, the media provide their only exposure to official statistics.
'''Television''' is the primary news source for citizens in industrialized countries, even if '''radio''' and newspapers still play an important role in the dissemination of statistical information. On the other hand, '''newspapers and specialized economic and social magazines''' can provide more detailed coverage of statistical releases as the information on a specific theme can be quite extensive. Official statistics provides us with important information on the situation and the development trends in our society.

Users can gather information making use of the services of the National Statistical Offices. They can easily find it on the '''agency's website'''.
The development of computing technologies and the Internet has enabled users - businesses, educational institutions and households among others- to have access to statistical information. The Internet has become an important tool for statistical producers to disseminate their data and information. People are able to access information online. The supply of information from statistical agencies has increased. Today the advanced agencies provide the information on their websites in an understandable way, often categorized for different groups of users.
Several glossaries have been set up by different organizations or statistical offices to provide more information and definitions in the field of statistics and consequently official statistics.

==Quality criteria to be respected==
The quality criteria of a national statistical office are the following: relevance, impartiality, dissemination, independence, transparency, confidentiality,  international standards {{citation needed|reason=This statement is too strong, particularly without citation, as there are many different quality standards. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics includes 'timeliness' and 'institutional environment', which are not present below or in others' data quality standards. cf OECD review of statistical data quality dimensions at http://www.oecd.org/std/na/34350524.pdf |date=October 2015}}. There principles apply not only to the NSO but to all producers of official statistics. Therefore, not every figure reported by a public body should be considered as official statistics, but those produced and disseminated according to the principles. Adherence to these principles will enhance the credibility of the NSO and other official statistical producers and build public trust in the reliability of the information and results that are produced.

===Relevance===
Relevance is the first and most important principles to be respected for national statistical offices. When releasing information, data and official statistics should be relevant in order to fulfil the needs of users as well as both public and private sector decision makers. Production of official statistics is relevant if it corresponds to different user needs like public, governments, businesses, research community, educational institutions, [[NGO]]s and international organizations or if it satisfies basic information in each area and citizen's right to information.

===Impartiality===
Once the survey has been made, the NSO checks the quality of the results and then they have to be disseminated no matter what impact they can have on some users, whether good or bad. All should accept the results released by the NSO as authoritative. Users need to perceive the results as unbiased representation of relevant aspects of the society. Moreover, the impartiality principle implies the fact that NSOs have to use understandable terminology for statistics' dissemination, [[questionnaires]] and material published so that everyone can have access to their information.

===Dissemination===
In order to maximize dissemination, statistics should be presented in a way that facilitates proper interpretation and meaningful comparisons. To reach the general public and non-expert users when disseminating, NSOs have to add explanatory comments to explain the significance of the results released and make analytical comments when necessary. There is a need to identify clearly what the preliminary, final and revised results are, in order to avoid confusion for users. All results of official statistics have to be publicly accessible. There are no results that should  be characterized as official and for the exclusive use of the government. Moreover, they should be disseminated simultaneously.

===Independence===
Users can be consulted by NSOs but the decisions should be made by statistical bodies. Information and activities of producers of official statistics should be independent of political control. Moreover, NSOs have to be free of any political interference that could influence their work and thus, the results. They should not make any political advice or policy-perspective comments on the results released at any time, even at [[press conferences]] or in interviews with the media.

===Transparency===
The need for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16635185&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=transparency&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 transparency] is essential for NSOs to gain the trust of the public. They have to expose to the public the methods they use to produce official statistics, and be accountable for all the decisions they take and the results they publish. Also, statistical producers should warn users of certain interpretations and false conclusions even if they try to be as precise as possible. Furthermore, the quality of the accurate and timely results must be assessed prior to release. But if errors in the results occur before or after the [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data revision],&lt;ref&gt;See Data Review/Data Checking in Glossary of Terms on Statistical Data Editing –
UNECE http://www.unece.org/stats/publications/editingglossary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; they should be directly corrected and information should be disseminated to the users at the earliest possible time. Producers of official statistics have to set analytical systems in order to change or improve their activities and methods.

===Confidentiality===
All data collected by the national statistical office must protect the privacy of individual respondents, whether persons or businesses. But on the contrary, government units such as institutions cannot invoke statistical confidentiality. All respondents have to be informed about the purpose and legal basis of the survey and especially about the confidentiality measures. The statistical office should not release any information that could identify an individual or group without prior consent. After data collection, replies should go back directly to the statistical producer, without involving any  intermediary. Data processing implies that filled-in paper and electronic form with full names should be destroyed.

===International standards===
The use of international standards at the national level aims to improve international comparability for national users and facilitate decision-making, especially when controversial. Moreover, the overall structure, including concepts and definitions, should follow internationally accepted standards, guidelines or good practices. International recommendations and standards for statistical methods approved by many countries provide them with a common basis like the two standards of the [[International Monetary Fund]], SDDS for '''Special Data Dissemination Standards''' and GDDS for '''General Data Dissemination System'''. Their aim is to guide countries in the dissemination of their economic and financial data to the public. Once approved, these standards have to be observed by all producers of official statistics and not only by the NSO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13828">'''Olney's lesions''', also known as '''[[NMDA receptor antagonist]] neurotoxicity''' ('''NAN'''), are a potential form of [[brain damage]] due to drugs that have been studied experimentally and have produced neuronal damage, yet are administered by doctors to humans in the settings of [[pharmacotherapy]] and of [[anesthesia]]. They are named after [[John Olney]], who conducted a study in 1989 to investigate [[neurotoxicity]] caused by [[phencyclidine|PCP]] and related drugs.&lt;ref name="olney"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olney J, Labruyere J, Price M |title=Pathological changes induced in cerebrocortical neurons by phencyclidine and related drugs |journal=Science |volume=244 |issue=4910 |pages=1360–2 |year=1989 |pmid=2660263 |doi=10.1126/science.2660263}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are important for two reasons. Firstly, [[NMDA receptor antagonist]] drugs are not only street drugs that are taken recreationally, they are also physician-prescribed drugs for therapeutic treatment of human diseases such as [[memantine]] for [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[amantadine]] for [[Parkinson's disease]]. Secondly in the field of anesthesiology, the [[dissociative]] anesthesia of many general anesthetics is due to NMDA receptor antagonist properties. Because the neuronal vacuolation of Olney's lesions evolves into neuronal [[necrosis]] or death of neurons, it is important to determine whether Olney's lesions occur in humans, not only in experimental animals. The essential question is whether an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]] drug is to be considered a human [[neurotoxin]] or not. The [[patient safety]] implications for [[pharmacotherapy]] and for [[anesthesia]] would each be profound, if the answer is affirmative. 

==History==
In 1989, Olney et al. discovered that neuronal [[vacuolation]] and other cytotoxic changes ("lesions") occurred in brains of rats administered NMDA antagonists, including [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[MK-801]] (dizocilpine) and [[ketamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Olney JW, Labruyere J, Price MT. (1989) Pathological Changes Induced in Cerebrocortical Neurons by Phencyclidine and Related Drugs. ''Science''.  244: 1360 - 1362. {{PMID|2660263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examination of neurons in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices by electron micrograph revealed apparent lytic breakdown of mitochondria in the large vacuoles which had become apparent 2 hours after administration of an NMDA antagonist.  After administration of 1.0 (mg/kg sc) MK-801 to rats, these neurotoxic changes became more apparent until about 12 hours post-dose, but the morphology of most cells appeared normal by light microscope about 24 hours post-dose.  With 10 (mg/kg sc) doses of MK-801, the vacuolation reaction was still visible by light microscope 48 hours post-dose.  After repeated doses of the NMDA antagonists MK-801 and PCP, the vacuolation reaction appeared consistent with the reaction after a single dose, so there was no evidence of a cumulative neurotoxic effect or that the reaction proceeded to an irreversible stage with repeated doses.  The lowest doses of ketamine and [[tiletamine]] that produced neurotoxic changes visible by light microscope 4 hours post dose were 40 (mg/kg sc) and 10 (mg/kg sc), respectively.  The potency of the drugs in producing these neurotoxic changes corresponded with their potency as NMDA antagonists: i.e. MK-801 &gt; PCP &gt; tiletamine &gt; ketamine.

Researcher [[Roland N. Auer]] conducted similar studies to look at the [[correlation]] between age and sex and the development of NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity in test rats. Older rats experienced a much higher [[mortality rate]] after the development of NAN. Female rats were found, at all ages, to have a higher incidence of [[necrotic]] (dead) [[neuron]]s as a result of NAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Auer RN |title=Effect of age and sex on N-[[methyl]]-D-[[aspartate]] antagonist-induced [[neuronal]] [[necrosis]] in rats |journal=Stroke |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=743–746 |year=1996 |pmid=8614941 |doi=10.1161/01.str.27.4.743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrous oxide]], a common [[anesthetic]] for humans (especially in [[dentistry]]), has also been shown to cause [[vacuolization]] in rats' brains, but caused no irreversible lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jevtovic-Todorovic V, Beals J, Benshoff N, Olney J |title=Prolonged exposure to inhalational [[anesthetic]] [[nitrous oxide]] kills [[neuron]]s in adult rat brain |journal=Neuroscience |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=609–16 |year=2003 |pmid=14622904 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2003.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dextromethorphan]], a common [[antitussive]] often found in [[cough medicine]]s, has been shown to cause vacuolization in rats' brains when administered at doses of 75&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hashimoto, K |author2=Tomitaka, S |author3=Narita, N |author4=Minabe, Y |author5=Iyo, M |author6=Fukui, S |title= Induction of [[heat shock protein]] [[Hsp70]] in rat [[retrosplenial]] [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] following administration of [[dextromethorphan]] |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=235–239 |year=1996 |doi= 10.1016/1382-6689(96)00016-6 |pmid=21781688}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, oral administration of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM HBr) to female rats in single doses as high as 120&amp;nbsp;mg/kg did not result in detectable neurotoxic changes at 4–6 hours or 24–26 hours post-dose (female rats are more sensitive to NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carliss RD, Radovsky A, Chengelis CP, O'neill TP, Shuey DL |title=Oral administration of dextromethorphan does not produce neuronal vacuolation in the rat brain |journal= NeuroToxicology|volume= 28|issue= 4|pages= 813–8|year=2007 |pmid=17573115 |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2007.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same researchers also found no evidence of neurotoxic changes in retrosplenial or cingulate cortices of male rats orally administered up to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/(kg day) DXM HBr or female rats orally administered 120&amp;nbsp;mg/(kg day) DXM HBr, both for 30 days.  Carliss et al. (2007) also found that rats administered 9&amp;nbsp;mg/(kg day sc) (+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate for 30 days did produce detectable vacuolation as expected.  When 30&amp;nbsp;mg/(kg ip) [[dextrorphan]] was administered to male rats, neurotoxic changes were observed only 30 minutes post-dose.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz GG, Guerrero JM, Reiter RJ, Poeggeler BH, Bitzer-Quintero OK, Feria-Velasco A. (1999) Neurotoxicity of dextrorphan.  Arch Med Res.  30: 125 - 127. {{PMID|10372446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the hypothesis of gross neural apoptosis proves to be false in humans, NMDA antagonists certainly have potential to permanently alter synaptic structure due to effects upon [[long term potentiation]], which NMDA plays a crucial role in. Perhaps, with repeated usage, this would manifest, due to tolerance, thus downregulation, of the NMDA receptor system. This could feasibly alter the function/relationship of various structures, specifically the ventral visual stream, which is a likely cause of the anecdotal reports of [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]] (HPPD) from such chronic users of novel psychoactive substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orsolini L, Papanti GD, De Berardis D, Guirguis A, Corkery JM, Schifano F |title=The “Endless Trip” among the NPS Users: Psychopathology and Psychopharmacology in the Hallucinogen-Persisting Perception Disorder. A Systematic Review |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=1-10 |year=2017 |pmid=29209235 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=October 2016}}

In 2013 a study using magnetic resonance imaging showed brain lesions in ketamine addicts with severity depending on the duration of addiction and daily intake of ketamine. Cortical atrophy and holes in superficial white matter are seen early on. After 4 years of addiction lesions spread throughout the brain and damage is evident in the pons and other deeper brain structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang C, Zheng D, Xu J, Lam W, Yew DT |title=Brain damages in ketamine addicts as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging  |journal= Frontiers in Neuroanatomy|volume= 7|issue= 23|year=2013 |doi= 10.3389/fnana.2013.00023}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy study by [[Johannes Kornhuber]] of 8 patients who had received [[amantadine]] therapy looked at the selectively vulnerable brain regions where Olney's lesions occur, the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, and found no evidence of Olney's lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Jellinger K, Wiltfang J, Leblhuber F, Riederer P |title=The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel blocker amantadine does not cause histopathological alterations in human brain tissue |year=1999 |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=98 |pages=85-90 |PMID=10412804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
In medical settings, NMDA receptor antagonists are used as anesthetics, so [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor positive allosteric modulators are used to effectively prevent any [[neurotoxicity]] caused by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakao S, Nagata A, Masuzawa M, Miyamoto E, Yamada M, Nishizawa N, Shingu K |title=[NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic activity] |journal=Masui |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=594–602 |year=2003 |pmid=12854473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drugs that work to suppress NAN include [[anticholinergics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/Cyclohexamines/nmda-toxicity.html [D.Wozniak - NMDA Antagonist Neurotoxicity: Mechanism and Prevention&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[benzodiazepines]], [[barbiturates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olney J, Labruyere J, Wang G, Wozniak D, Price M, Sesma M |title=NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity: mechanism and prevention |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5037 |pages=1515–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1835799 |doi=10.1126/science.1835799}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agonists]] at the [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor]] in the brain, such as [[clonidine]].
Conversely, coadministration of NMDA-antagonists with alpha-2 adrenergic [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]], like [[yohimbine]] could theoretically potentiate NAN.

==Controversy==
In Karl L. R. Jansen's book, ''Ketamine: Dreams and Realities'', unpublished studies are cited on [[monkey]] brains. The opinion that DXM caused Olney's Lesions therefore came under fire. Jansen writes:

{{cquote|[[Roland Auer]] injected the [[common squirrel monkey]] with [[Dizocilpine]], or MK-801 and was unable to produce any vacuoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Auer RN, Coupland SG, Jason GW, Archer DP, Payne J, Belzberg AJ, Ohtaki M, Tranmer BI |title=Postischemic therapy with MK-801 ([[dizocilpine]]) in a primate model of transient focal brain ischemia                                                                                                                                                            |journal=Molecular and Chemical Neuropathology |volume=29 |issue=2-3 |pages=193-210 |year=1996 |pmid=8971696 |doi=10.1007/BF02815002}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The brain regions where Olney's lesions occur show hypermetabolism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurumaji A, McCulloch J |title=Effects of MK-801 upon local cerebral glucose utilisation in conscious rats and in rats anaesthetised with halothane |journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume=9 |pages=786-794 |year=1989 |pmid=2684992 |doi=10.1038/jcbfm.1989.112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [R]ats have rates of brain [[metabolism]] that are almost twice as high as those in humans to start with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blin J, Ray CA, Chase TN, Piercey MF |title=Regional cerebral glucose metabolism compared in rodents and humans |journal=Brain Research |volume=568 |pages=215-222 |pmid=1814569}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this higher basal rate of cerebral metabolism that lesions may appear in rodents but not in large, mature primate brains. Ketamine causes over-excitement and euphoria in rats at doses below those at which it activates shutdown systems.

Frank Sharp also works in this area. I discussed with Sharp how this issue stood in 1998. His view was that reversible [[toxic]] changes in the rat started to appear at 40mg/kg and reached a level at which no further changes occurred (a plateau) at 100mg/kg, when a little cell death could be seen - but matters would not progress beyond this point. Extensive attempts to produce toxic changes in monkeys had been a total failure at doses up to 10mg/kg i.m. These Gorilla studies are unpublished. 

I sought the view of Olney's colleague, Dr Nuri Farber. The work of his team indicated that N-P receptors must be blocked for at least 2 hours to cause reversible changes, and at least 24 hours to produce some cell death, in rats.
[...][H]e thought that the methods used in monkey studies so far were unsatisfactory, because the animals were probably too young. Only adult rats show the toxic changes. He was not prepared to accept a clean bill of health for the drug in [[primate]]s until this work with elderly Gorillas had been done, and until the [[drug company|drug companies]] published their Gorilla studies to support their claims of harmlessness.

There is thus no published evidence at this time (January 2000) that ketamine can produce toxic cell changes in monkeys. The unpublished monkey data that we know about, that of Frank Sharp, actually shows that there is no damage at doses up to 10mg/kg.|1em|1em|Karl Jansen|''Ketamine: Dreams and Realities'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, Karl.

'''Pal(a)eoethnobotany''' or '''Archaeobotany''' is the [[archaeology|archaeological]] sub-field that studies [[plant]] remains from archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Current Paleoethnobotany Analytical Methods and Cultural Interpretations of Archaeological Plant Remains&lt;/ref&gt;  Basing on the recovery and identification of plant remains and the ecological and cultural information available for modern plants, the major research themes are the use of wild plants, the [[origins of agriculture]] and [[domestication]], and the [[co-evolution]] of human-plant interactions.

==Preservation==
Plant macro[[fossil]]s are preserved through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually [[cereal]] grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) when they are heated in a reducing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Märkle |first1=T|last2=Rösch|first2=M |title=Experiments on the effects of carbonization on some cultivated plant seeds |journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany |volume=17|pages=257–263 |doi=10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are referred to as 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those that are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hillman, G |title=Reconstructing crop husbandry practices from charred remains of crops|editor1-last=Mercer|editor1-first=R |work=Farming Practice in British Prehistory |date=1981|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=123–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions are preserved as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenward |first1=H|last2=Hall |first2=A |title=Urban organic archaeology: an irreplacable palaeoecological archive at risk|journal=World Archaeology|date=2014 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=584–596 |doi=10.1080/00438240802453286|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438240802453286#.VET0DIvF9ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacomet, S |title=Archaeobotany: analyses of plant remains from waterlogged archaeological sites|editor1-last=Menotti|editor1-first=F|editor2-last=O'Sullivan |editor2-first=A |work=The Oxford Handbook of Wetland Archaeology|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=497–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and fruit stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D |title=Defining an ‘indicator package’ to allow identification of ‘cess pits’ in the archaeological record|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=40|pages=526–543 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.06.014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312002531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside fruit stones, cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Veen|first1=M|title=Formation processes of desiccated and carbonized plant remains e the identification of routine practice |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |date=2007 |volume=34 |issue=6|pages=968–990 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.09.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440306001865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery methods ==
Paleoethnobotanists use a variety of methods to recover and identify plant remains. Charred plant remains are usually recovered by flotation. The matrix (the soil from a suspected [[feature (archaeology)|archaeological feature]]) is slowly added to agitated water.  The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as ''heavy fraction'', sink to the bottom. Less dense organic material, such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called ''light fraction'', is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500&amp;nbsp;µm). The light fraction is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope.  Samples of the heavy fraction are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/archaeobotany/buckets|title=buckets - archaeobotany|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump. Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory. &lt;ref&gt;Tolar et al. 2010. Recovery techniques for waterlogged archaeological sediments: a comparison of different treatment methods for samples from Neolithic lake shore settlements. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany 19: 53-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Desiccated plant remains are usually recovered by dry-sieving, using a stack of different sieves to separate larger items such as cereal straw and fruit stones from smaller items such as weed seeds. &lt;ref&gt;Cappers, R. T. J. and Neef, R. 2012. Handbook of Plant Palaeoecology. Groningen: Barkhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and Quantification ==
Identification of macroremains is then usually carried out under a stereomicroscope, using [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features such as shape and surface features in the case of seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Method and Theory in Paleoethnobotany|last=Fritz|first=G|last2=Nesbitt|first2=M|publisher=University of Colorado|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=115–145|chapter=Laboratory analysis and identification of plant macroremains}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[histology|microanatomy]] in the case of wood or charcoal. Identification literature as well as a comparative collection of modern plant materials are crucial for reliable results. Depending on the type of material, and its condition, also other methods such as [[thin section]]s or [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] are applied. Plant macroremains are quantified on the basis of a sample, using either quantitative, semi-quantitive, or presence/absence scores.

Paleoethnobotanists also recover and analyze microremains (such as [[phytoliths]] and [[palynology|pollen]]), human and animal excrements ([[paleofeces]], sometimes called [[coprolite]]s), or plant impressions in ceramic sherds and clay (such as in daub).

[[Palynology]] is a mature and distinct scientific discipline that studies [[pollen]], typically in the context of reconstructing past environments.

[[Dendrochronology]], the study of growth rings on trees relating to study of past environments, is another scientific discipline useful to paleoethnobotanical study.

==Research==
The work done in paleoethnobotany can be divided into [[field work]], collections management, systematic description of species, and theories into the origins of human and plant interaction. Some examples of this analysis:

A paleoethnobotanist may find discrete concentrations of burned or dried remnants of seeds in an area of discolored soil (a possible [[hearth]] feature).  If later analyses indicates that the remnants were of only mature wild seeds of a type of plant that grows locally, it could be inferred that the site was only visited seasonally.  Such an inference could be supported by a lack of other features that would suggest that no permanent shelters were built at the site.

Alternatively, a paleoethnobotanist may find that a fire pit
feature contains concentrated remnants of a wide variety of edible
wild plants that mature throughout the year.  An archaeologist may find
features at the site that indicate some sort of semi-permanent
dwellings (such as post holes and [[middens]]).  The middens may have
concentrations of animal remains, identified by a [[zooarchaeology|zooarchaeologist]] as those of wild game, with a variety of species-specific maturity levels.  In that case, a more permanent settlement may be inferred, perhaps to the level of a village.  Such an analysis of the archaeological features could suggest a society of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who inhabited the site on a
more-or-less year-round basis.

A paleoethnobotanist may also find concentrated remains of plants
that typically are only grown through active [[tillage|cultivation]] (such as [[cereals]], [[legumes]], and [[oilseeds]]).  At the same site, an archaeologist might identify features such as stone walls surrounding enclosures arrayed in a pattern, and deep, layered middens with concentrations of domesticated animal remains such as goats or pigs.  An analysis of the site, set within the context of the archaeological features and animal and plant remains, would suggest a settled [[agriculture|agrarian]] community.

[[File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 002.jpg|thumb|''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Jan Vermeer]]]]
[[File:Portrait_of_Xaviera_Hollander_looking_naughty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Xaviera Hollander]], a former madam, [[call girl]], and author, at one time New York City's leading madam|alt=[[Xaviera Hollander]], a former madam, call girl, and author (at one time New York City's leading madam).]]

'''Procuring''' or '''pandering''' is the facilitation or provision of a [[prostitute]] or [[sex worker]] in the arrangement of a [[sex act]] with a customer.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, B. &amp; Black, H. (2004). [[Black's Law Dictionary]]. Belmont: Thomson/West.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''procurer''', colloquially called a '''pimp''' (if male) or a '''madam''' (if female), is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] for [[prostitution|prostitutes]] who collects part of their [[income|earnings]]. The procurer may receive this money in return for advertising services, physical protection, or for providing, and possibly monopolizing, a location where the prostitute may engage clients. Like prostitution, the legality of certain actions of a madam or a pimp vary from one region to the next.

Examples of procuring include:
*[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] a person into a country for the purpose of soliciting sex
*operating a prostitution business
*transporting a prostitute to the location of their arrangement
*deriving financial gain from the prostitution of another

== Overview ==
Procuring can often take abusive forms. Pimps may punish clients for physical abuse or failure to pay, and enforce exclusive rights to 'turf' where their prostitutes may advertise and operate with less competition.&lt;ref name="Figueroa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/13/local/me-figueroa13|title=L.A. seeks to thwart sex trade on Figueroa|last=Zahniser|first=David|date=13 May 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the many places where prostitution is outlawed, sex workers have decreased incentive to report abuse for fear of [[self-incrimination]], and increased motivation to seek any physical protection from clients and law enforcement that a pimp might provide.

The pimp–prostitute relationship is widely understood to be abusive and possessive, with the pimp/madam using techniques such as psychological intimidation, manipulation, starvation, rape and/or gang rape, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victim's family, forced drug use and the shame from these acts.&lt;ref name="55facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facts.randomhistory.com/human-trafficking-facts.html|title=55 Little Known Facts About... Human Trafficking|publisher=Random History|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoMonstrous"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=E. Benjamin|title=A Crime So Monstrous: Face-to-Face with Modern-Day Slavery|publisher=Free Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7432-9007-4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_crime_so_monstrous.html?id=-47aorGBguMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus et al., however, suggested that these assumptions about abusive relationships represent stereotyped oppression narratives that may only represent a small percentage of the relationships between pimps and sexworkers.&lt;ref name="marcus"&gt;Marcus, Anthony, et al. "Conflict and Agency among Sex Workers and Pimps: A Closer Look at Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking". The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science May 2014 vol. 653 no. 1 225-246. doi: 10.1177/0002716214521993.&lt;/ref&gt; In an edited volume about third parties in different parts of the world, several studies show that third parties and sex workers can have complex and long-term relationships that are not centered on exploitative dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Horning, A., &amp; Marcus, A. (Eds.). (2017). Third Party Sex Work and Pimps in the Age of Anti-trafficking. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pimps can be arrested and charged with pandering and are legally known as procurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pandering |title=Pandering |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the tendency to identify pimping with African American masculinity, may provide some of the explanation for why 62% of all "confirmed" human traffickers in the United States are African American men.&lt;ref name="Banks"&gt;Banks, Duren, and Tracey Kyckelhahn. 2011. Characteristics of suspected human trafficking incidents,2008–2010. Washington, DC: Bureau of Justice Statistics. Available from http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cshti0810.pdf (accessed 7 August 2013)..&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it has recently been argued that some of the extreme examples of violence cited in the article below come primarily from such stereotyping supported by Hollywood screenwriters, selective and decontextualized trial transcripts, and studies that have only interviewed parties to sex commerce in institutions of rescue, prosecution, and punishment, rather than engaging rigorous study in situ.&lt;ref name="horning"&gt;Horning, A. (2013). Peeling the onion: domestically trafficked minors and other sex work involved youth.

== Legal status and debates about legality ==
In most places where prostitution is illegal, so is procuring, no matter if the relationship between the procurer and prostitute is {{clarify |text=formal or informal.|date=September 2017}} Where [[Decriminalizing sex work|prostitution is decriminalized]] or [[regulated]], procuring may or may not be legal. In [[jurisdictions]] where procuring is allowed, however, the only{{dubious |date=September 2017}} forms permitted do not involve threats or other forms of [[non-consensual acts]] towards the prostitute or other persons; all procuring regulations differ widely from place to place.

[[Legality of prostitution|Procuring and brothels are legal]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[New Zealand]], most of [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]] and [[Prostitution in Nevada|Nevada]], among other places.{{citation needed |date=September 2017}}

===Canada===
{{Main|Bedford v. Canada}}
In [[Canada]], there was a legal challenge to prostitution laws, which ended in the 2013 ruling of ''[[Bedford v. Canada]]''. In 2010,  [[Ontario]] Superior Court Judge Susan Himel overturned the national laws banning brothels and procuring, arguing that they violated the constitution guaranteeing "the right to life, liberty and security".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11432138 Canadian judge overturns brothel ban in Ontario], [[BBC]]. 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ontario [[Appeal Court]] reaffirmed the unconstitutionality of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/03/26/ontario-appeal-court-sex-trade-laws-monday.html Ontario Appeal Court strikes down ban on brothels], [[CBC News]]. 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed by the [[Canadian government]], and was under trial in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-top-court-to-hear-prostitution-challenge-today-1.1323766 |title=Canada's top court to hear prostitution challenge today &amp;#124; |website=[[CTV News]] |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the remaining prostitution laws. {{As of |2014}}, the Canadian government began working on replacing those regulations with ones that don't violate the Canadian constitution.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] 1949 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] requires state signatories to ban pimping and brothels, and to abolish regulation of individual prostitutes. It states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/trafficpersons.pdf |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others
 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 1

The Parties to the present Convention agree to punish any person who, to gratify the passions of another:

(1) Procures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person;

(2) Exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person.

Article 2

The Parties to the present Convention further agree to punish any person who:

(1) Keeps or manages, or knowingly finances or takes part in the financing of a brothel;

(2) Knowingly lets or rents a building or other place or any part thereof for the purpose of the prostitution of others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various UN commissions however have differing positions on the issue. For example, in 2012, a [[UNAIDS]] commission convened by Ban Ki-moon and backed by [[UNDP]] and UNAIDS, recommended the [[Decriminalizing sex work|decriminalization of brothels and procuring]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/4128420.html Decriminalisation integral to the fight against HIV], Michael Kirby &amp; Michael Wong, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnsnews.com/news/article/un-commission-calls-legalizing-prostitution-worldwide U.N.

== Etymology ==
{{wikt|procurer}}
=== ''Procurer'' ===

The term ''procurer'' derives from the French ''procureur''.

=== ''Pimping'' ===
The word ''pimp'' first appeared in English in 1607 in a [[Thomas Middleton]] play entitled ''[[Your Five Gallants]].'' Of unknown origin, but may have stemmed from the French infinitive ''pimper'' meaning to dress up elegantly and from the present participle ''pimpant'' meaning alluring in seductive dress. ''Pimp'' used as a verb, meaning to act as a pimp, first appeared in 1636 in [[Philip Massinger]]'s play, ''[[The Bashful Lover]]''.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term was commonly used to refer to [[informant|informers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsoniansource.org/display/primarysource/viewdetails.aspx?PrimarySourceId=1004 |title=Pennsylvania Gazette, Nov 7, 1765, transcription |publisher=Smithsonian Source |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pimp can also mean "a despicable person".&lt;ref&gt;"Webster's College Dictionary", Random House, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be applied to a person who is considered a [[:wikt:ladies' man|ladies' man]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;
[[Jesse Sheidlower]]: [http://www.slate.com/id/2184211/ A History of Pimping. What the word meant and what it means now.] [[Slate.com]], 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb "pimping" came up in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Rapper [[Nelly]] tried to redefine the word "pimp" by saying that it is an [[acronym]] for "positive, intellectual, motivated person." He created a [[college scholarship]] with the name "P.I.M.P. Juice Scholarship". Dawn Turner Trice of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' argues that there is "something truly unsettling, to say the least, about attaching such a vile word to a scholarship" and expresses concern about the glamorization of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Trice, Dawn Turner. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-04-27/news/0504270140_1_rap-word-frat "Scholarship is soured by unsavory name"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 27 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of the 21st century, a new meaning of the word has emerged in the form of a transitive verb ''pimp'', which means "to decorate" or "to [[wiktionary : gussy up|gussy up]]" (compare ''[[primping|primp]]'', especially in Scottish usage). This new definition was made popular by ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', an [[MTV]] television show.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Although this new definition paid homage to [[hip-hop]] culture and its connection to street culture, it has now entered common, even mainstream commercial, use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2007/09/20/NEWS-PimpMyFeetVerb-F.rtf.aspx | title= Feet pimping | date=20 September 2007 | accessdate=26 September 2007 |publisher=[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical contexts, the verb means "to ask (a student) a question for the purpose of testing her or his knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brancati|first=Frederick L.|title=The Art of Pimping|journal=JAMA|date=7 July 1989|volume=262|issue=1|page=89|url=http://www.neonatology.org/pearls/pimping.html|doi=10.1001/jama.1989.03430010101039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Pandering'' ===
The word "pander", meaning to "pimp" is derived from [[Pandarus]], a licentious figure who facilitates the affair between the protagonists in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laughter in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Times: Epistemology of a Fundamental Human Behavior, Its Meaning, and Consequences  |last=Classen |first=Albrecht |year=2010 |isbn=978-3110245479 |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandarus appears with a similar role in [[Shakespeare]]'s interpretation of the story, ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

{{criminal law}}
Pimping is sometimes operated like a business.&lt;ref name="reallyreallypimping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/really_really_pimpin_in_da_south/|title=Really Really Pimpin' in Da South|author=|date=|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pimp may have a [[bottom girl]] who serves as office manager, keeping the pimp apprised of law-enforcement activity and collecting money from the prostitutes.&lt;ref name="pipkins"&gt;[http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200214306.pdf U.S. v. Pipkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911145823/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200214306.pdf |date=2012-09-11 }}, 378 F.3d 1281, (11th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Pimps recognize a [[hierarchy]] among themselves. The least respected, or newer pimps, are the "popcorn pimps" and "wannabes". "Popcorn pimps" was a phenomenon which occurred among adolescent cocaine users of both sexes who utilized children younger than themselves to support their habits.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro, Ann Marie and Pagliaro, Louis A. (1996). Substance abuse among children and adolescents : its nature, extent, and effects from conception to adulthood. New York: Wiley, p. 19. {{ISBN|9780471580423}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A pimp who uses violence and intimidation to control his prostitutes is called a "guerrilla pimp", while those who use psychological trickery to deceive younger prostitutes into becoming hooked into the system are called "finesse pimps".&lt;ref&gt;378 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004). http://openjurist.org/378/f3d/1281/united-states-v-pipkins&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the business is obtaining and maintaining a selection of prostitutes. Losing one's prostitute to another pimp is known as being "peeled". Informing a pimp that one of his prostitutes has switched pimps is a professional courtesy, and any attempt to respond to this courtesy with violence will quickly get the violent pimp labeled a "Gorilla" or "Godzilla". Prostitutes who move between pimps often are labeled as a "Choosey Susie". In addition, a prostitute may "bounce" from pimp to pimp without paying the "pimp moving" tax.&lt;ref&gt;
Western Michigan University, [http://www.wmich.edu/destinys-end/pimping%20game.htm ''The Pimping Game'']. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113021452/http://www.wmich.edu/destinys-end/pimping%20game.htm |date=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large percentage of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as a major source of funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While selling drugs may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentencing]] laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence of gangs (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used to go after the more serious and violent offenders.&lt;ref name="Prostitution &amp; Gangs"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Deane|first=Matthew|title=Prostitution &amp; Gangs. Techniques for going after violent offenders|url=http://www.lawofficer.com/article/prostitution-gangs|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pimp business has an internal structure – built around violence – for dealing with rule breakers. For example, pimps have been known to employ a "[[pimp stick]]", which is two coat hangers wrapped together, in order to subdue unruly prostitutes.&lt;ref name="pipkins"/&gt; A variation is a "pimp cane", used for similar purposes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Another punishment for disobedient prostitutes is to "trunk" them, where the pimp locks the prostitute in the trunk of a car. Although prostitutes are supposedly free to move between pimps, this movement sometimes leads to violence. For example, a prostitute could be punished for merely looking at another pimp; this is considered "reckless eyeballing".&lt;ref name="pipkins"/&gt; Violence is also used on customers, for example if the customer attempts to evade payment or becomes unruly with a prostitute.

Many pimps tattoo prostitutes as a mark of "ownership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27runaways.html?pagewanted=all|title=RUNNING IN THE SHADOWS; For Runaways on the Street, Sex Buys Survival|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=27 October 2009|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Julie, [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=humtrafconf2 "The Intersection of Law, Theology, and Human Trafficking in the Narrative of Joseph: Linking the Past to the Present"] (2010).

=== Internet effect ===
Since the Internet became widely available, it has become the preferred medium for prostitution. Prostitutes increasingly use websites to solicit sexual encounters. In turn, pimps have used these sites to broker their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=Pimps Go Online to Lure Kids Into Prostitution|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/02/pimping/|newspaper=Wired|date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of portrayals ===
Some [[sex workers rights]] advocates and activists dispute the portrayal of third-party agents as "violent pimps" to be an inaccurate exaggeration used to foster harmful policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNeill|first=Maggie|title=The Honest Courtesan: Bogeymen|url=https://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/bogeymen/|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pornography and procuring ==
Attempts have been made in the U.S. to charge pornographic-film producers with pandering under state law. The case of ''California v. Freeman'' in 1989 is one of the most prominent examples where a producer/director of pornographic films was charged with pandering under the argument that paying porn actors to perform sex on camera was a form of prostitution covered by a state anti-pandering statute. The State Supreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the California pandering statute was not intended to cover the hiring of actors who would be engaging in sexually-explicit but non-obscene performances. It also stated that only in cases where the producer paid the actors for the purpose of sexually gratifying themselves or other actors, could the producer be charged with pandering under state law. This case effectively legalized pornography in the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=488&amp;invol=1311 |title=California v.

'''Response Prompting Procedures''' are systematic strategies used to increase the probability of correct responding and opportunities for positive reinforcement for learners by providing and then systematically removing [[prompts]]. Response prompting is sometimes called "errorless" learning because teaching using these procedures usually results in few errors by the learner. The goal of response prompting is to transfer [[stimulus control]] from the prompt to the desired [https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Discriminative+Stimulus discriminative stimulus]. Several response prompting procedures are commonly used in [[special education]] research: (a) system of least prompts, (b) most to least prompting, (c) progressive and constant time delay, and (d) simultaneous prompting.

==System of least prompts==
The SLP prompting procedure uses and removes prompts by moving through a hierarchy from less to more restrictive prompts.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; If the student emits the correct behavior at any point during this [http://www.educateautism.com/applied-behaviour-analysis/discrete-trial-training.html instructional trial] (with or without prompts), reinforcement is provided. The system of least prompts gives the learner the opportunity to exhibit the correct response with the least restrictive level of prompting needed. Because teachers are required to use multiple types of prompts (e.g., verbal and physical prompts), the SLP prompting procedure may be complicated for use in typical settings,&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; but may be similar to [https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/html/prfteachers/reading_first1phonics.html non-systematic teaching] procedures typically used by teachers that involve giving learners an opportunity to exhibit a behavior independently before providing a prompt.

''Example: SLP trial for teaching sitting behavior''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Prompt Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence
|-
| Independent || Gives direction:"Everyone sit in their desk"|| Unprompted Correct: Sits (provide reinforcer)|| No response (provide prompt 1)|| Unprompted Incorrect (provide prompt 1)
|-
| Verbal Prompt || Gives Prompt 1: "Matt, please sit in your desk"|| Prompted Correct: Sits (provide reinforcer)|| No response (provide prompt 2)|| Prompted Incorrect (provide prompt 2)
|-
| Gesture Prompt || Gives Prompt 2: "Everyone sit in their desk." Moves towards and points to desk || Prompted Correct: Sits (provide reinforcer)|| No response (provide prompt 3)|| Prompted Incorrect (provide prompt 3)
|-
| Physical Prompt || Gives Prompt 3: Puts hands on learner's shoulders and physically guides him to sit || Prompted Correct: Sits (provide reinforcer)|| No response (ignore). This response is unlikely: re-evaluate prompt and/or value of reinforcer || No response (ignore). This response is unlikely: re-evaluate prompt and/or value of reinforcer
|}

SLP has been widely used for a variety of learners and skills. It has been most widely used in a 1:1 format (individual instruction) for [[chained skills]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; It has recently been used in conjunction with new technology, like portable DVD players and video iPods, to each self-help skills to young adults with intellectual disabilities&lt;ref&gt;Mechling, L. C., Gast, D. L., &amp; Fields, E. A. (2008). Evaluation of a portable DVD player and system of least prompts to self-prompt cooking task completion by young adults with moderate intellectual disabilities. The Journal of Special Education, 42, 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt; and to improve transition skills for elementary school students with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Cihak, D., Fahrenkrog, C., Ayres, K. M., &amp; Smith, C. (2010). The use of video modeling via a video iPod and a system of least prompts to improve transitional behaviors for students with autism spectrum disorders in the general education classroom. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 12, 103-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most to least prompting==
The MTL prompting procedure (Cuvo, Leaf, &amp; Borakove, 1978) removes prompts by moving through a hierarchy from most restrictive to less restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The MTL prompting procedure begins with the most restrictive prompt, usually a physical prompt. After the learner has received reinforcement for completing the task with physical prompts, a less restrictive prompt is given (e.g., a partial physical prompt), and then an even less restrictive prompt (e.g., verbal prompt). Usually, a specific criterion is set for each prompt change (e.g., after three days of correct performance of the behavior with the use of a partial physical prompt, a verbal prompt will be used). If the individual fails to perform the behavior correctly with the less intrusive prompt, the instructor would return to a more intrusive prompt for a specified number of trials.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the discriminative stimulus for the behavior is the typically [[occurring stimulus]] (e.g., when lunch is finished, student independently goes to the sink to wash hands) or the direction (e.g., when teacher says "Class, it is time to sit in your desks", the student sits in his desk).

''Example: MTL prompting procedure for opening lunchbox''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Order of Prompts !! Prompting Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Criterion for Moving to Less Intrusive Prompt
|-
| 1 || Physical || Places hands over learner's hands and physically guides learner to open lunchbox || 3 days at 100% correct responding with physical prompts
|-
| 2 || Verbal || Says "Matt, open your lunchbox." || 3 days at 100% correct responding with verbal prompts
|-
| 3 || Independent || Gives learner his lunchbox || N/A
|}

MTL prompting procedures have been most often used to teach chained tasks (e.g., hand washing) to learners with intellectual disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1984). Effective and efficient procedures for the transfer of stimulus control. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt; but has been used to teach learners with mild to profound disabilities from infants to adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolery and Gast&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1984). Effective and efficient procedures for the transfer of stimulus control. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that MTL prompting procedures should be used with [[Imitative learning|non-imitative learners]] who may not initially respond to less-restrictive prompts like models and may not be as efficient for imitative learners with mild or no disabilities.

==Constant and progressive time delay==
With CTD and PTD procedures, the same prompt is used throughout, and this prompt should ensure that the learner can give the correct response: It is a "controlling" prompt. The time delay prompt procedures are different from SLP and MTL procedures because instead of removing prompts by progressing through a [[hierarchy]], prompts are removed by delaying them in time. The progressive time delay procedure was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Touchette, P. E., (1971). Transfer of stimulus control: Measuring the moment of transfer. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 15, 347-354.&lt;/ref&gt; and the constant time delay procedure was developed as a more [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] procedure for teaching students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. E., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1981). Applying the time delay procedure to the instruction of the severely handicapped. Journal of the Association for the Severely Handicapped, 6, 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt; CTD and PTD are systematic procedures that use the teaching strategy of waiting on a learner's response that has likely been used haphazardly for years.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using time delay procedures, a prompt is initially given immediately after the desired discriminative stimulus. For example, immediately after the teacher says "What is this?" while showing a picture of a dog, she gives the student the correct answer "dog". After a pre-specified number of trials (when teaching discrete tasks, usually this is a "session" comprising at least 10 trials), the prompt is delayed. In the previous example, the teacher would ask the question "What is this?" and would then wait a few seconds before giving the controlling prompt "dog". PTD delays the prompt in time gradually, so the teacher would first wait 1 second, then 2 seconds, etc. CTD delays the prompt in time only once, usually by 3–5 seconds.

''Example: Trial during an initial session of PTD or CTD to teach naming''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Prompt Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence
|-
| Prompted || "What is this? Dog." While showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds) || Prompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Prompted Incorrect: "Cat" (ignore)|| No Response (ignore)
|}

During initial sessions, the learner is not given the opportunity to respond independently because the prompt is given immediately (0-second delay). However, in subsequent sessions, a learner is given an opportunity to respond independently because the prompt is delayed in time. The learner accesses reinforcement more quickly if s/he answers independently, but s/he is still reinforced for prompted responses.

''Example: Trial during a subsequent session of PTD or CTD to teach naming''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Prompt Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence
|-
| Independent || "What is this?" while showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds)|| Unprompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Unprompted Incorrect: "Cat" (remind to wait for a prompt if s/he doesn't know the answer) || No Response (provide prompt)
|-
| Prompted || "What is this? Dog." While showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds)|| Prompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Prompted Incorrect: "Cat" (ignore)|| No Response (ignore)
|}

PTD and CTD are similar except that the delay is gradual for PTD and immediate for CTD. For students who are not able to wait for a prompt when they are unable to independently perform a skill, PTD may be a better choice as a prompting strategy because it will decrease errors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example: Delay by session for PTD and CTD''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Session !! PTD Delay !! CTD Delay
|-
| 1 || 0 sec || 0 sec
|-
| 2 || 1 sec || 3 sec
|-
| 3 || 2 sec || 3 sec
|-
| 4 || 3 sec || 3 sec
|-
| 5 and remaining sessions || 3 sec || 3 sec
|}

CTD and PTD have been extensively used and found to be effective with a variety of students with and without disabilities, across both discrete and chained skills, in both individual and small group settings, for learners from toddlers to adults. Like SLP, CTD has been used in conjunction with new technologies like SMART boards to teach children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mechling, L. C., Gast, D. L., &amp; Krupa, K. (2007). Impact of SMART board technology: An investigation of sight word reading and observational learning. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 37, 1869-1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, M. L., &amp; Mechling, L. C. (2009). Small group computer-assisted instruction with SMART board technology: An investigation of observational and incidental learning of nontarget information. Remedial and Special Education, 30, 47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneous prompting==
A modification of the time delay procedures was presented by [[Schuster Time Delay Modification|Schuster]] and colleagues in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, A. N., &amp; Schuster, J. W. (1992). The use of simultaneous prompting for teaching expressive word identification to preschoolers with developmental delays. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 12, 247-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, J. W., Griffen, A. K., &amp; Wolery, M. (1992). Comparison of simultaneous prompting and constant time delay procedures in teaching sight words to elementary students with moderate mental retardation. Journal of Behavioral Education, 2, 305-325.&lt;/ref&gt; For this procedure, the same prompt is given during every session (a controlling prompt; similar to CTD &amp; PTD). However, the prompt is not delayed in time. During every instructional session, the prompt is immediately given to the student after the stimulus is presented (see 0 second delay sessions, above). The learner does not have a chance to emit an unprompted response during these sessions. However, immediately before each session, a probe session is conducted to test whether the child can emit an unprompted correct response. So, using an example similar to the one above, a teacher might present a picture and ask "What is this?" and then immediately give a prompt ("dog") during instructional sessions. Each day prior to instructional sessions, the teacher would ask "What is this?" but provide no prompts. This probe session is done to test whether the student has acquired the material. Instruction ends when the learner reaches a criterion level (e.g., 100% correct for 3 consecutive days) during probe sessions.

The primary advantage of [[simultaneous]] prompting, when compared with time delay procedures, is that a learner does not need to have the prerequisite skill of waiting for a prompt if he or she cannot independently emit the behavior. It is also a less complicated procedure for teachers to use because there are fewer response variations (e.g., unprompted corrects and unprompted incorrects are not possible) and fewer prompt variations (e.g., no need to vary prompt intrusiveness or delay).

Simultaneous prompting has been used with learners from three years of age through adulthood, and with learners with learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and learners without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, T. E., &amp; Schuster, J. W. (2004). Simultaneous prompting: A Review of the Literature. Education and Training in Developmental Disabilities, 39, 153-168.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study suggests that it may not be necessary to conduct probes every day,&lt;ref&gt;Reichow, B., &amp; Wolery, M. (2009). Comparison of everyday and every-fourth-day probe sessions with the simultaneous prompting procedure. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 29, 79-89.&lt;/ref&gt; but further research is needed to determine how frequency of probe sessions affects efficiency of the procedure.

==Summary and limitations==
All of the discussed response prompting procedures can be considered evidence based practices using the criteria suggested by [https://education.uoregon.edu/users/horner Horner] and colleagues in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, R. H., Carr, E. G., Halle, J., McGee, G., Odom, S., &amp; Wolery, M. (2005). The use of single-subject research to identify evidence based practice in special education. Exceptional Children, 71, 165-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M. (in press). Studying response prompting procedures. In C. H. Kennedy (Ed.), Context, intervention, and disability: Essays in honor of Thomas G. Haring.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that response prompting is effective for learners from preschool through adulthood, in a variety of instructional contexts (e.g., embedded into large group activities, during small group direct instruction). In addition, studies have shown that a variety of instructional agents, including teachers, assistants, and peers with and without disabilities, can accurately use prompting procedures.

Little is known about the use of prompting procedures when procedural fidelity is low, as it may be in typical instructional contexts, though errors in some steps of the procedure may not impede learning.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbers, J. S. (1989). Effects of high and low procedural fidelity in the delay interval of the constant time delay procedure. Unpublished Master's degree thesis. University of Kentucky, Lexington.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies regarding typical errors made by instructors and the effects of the errors on acquisition of skills by learners are needed. In addition, prompting procedures have been primarily used to teach specific responses rather than response classes (e.g., conversational skills, social play skills). The relative effectiveness of response prompting procedures to teach response classes needs to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbers, J. S. (1989). Effects of high and low procedural fidelity in the delay interval of the constant time delay procedure. Unpublished Master's degree thesis. University of Kentucky, Lexington.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Science Education at the Crossroads''' is an annual national [[academic conference]], initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], designed to enable various stakeholders in [[science education]] to confer in a legitimate and productive manner.  The conference also claims to offer an alternative to the standard model of conferring and professional development.   Conference creators and coordinators are [[John Settlage]] of the [[University of Connecticut]] and Adam Johnston of [[Weber State University]].

==Philosophy==
Many organizations and conferences exist for science educators.  These include the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), the [http://narst.org/ National Association for Research in Science Teaching] (NARST), the [http://aste.chem.pitt.edu/ Association for Science Teacher Education] (ASTE), and many others dedicated to specific fields (e.g., physics and chemistry) within science education.  While these organizations are adept at presenting research results or at sharing innovations in teaching, organizers and many participants in Crossroads feel that none of them provide a means for new research questions, policy directives, or general science education goals to be discussed and deliberated.

Crossroads uses the [[Vexation and Venture]] format for conference sessions in which an "Incubator Forum" allows for an interactive, discussion based and dynamic intersection of views.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2006, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/crossroads_ASTEproceedings_2006.pdf Science Education at the Crossroads]. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of interaction has been shown to engage presenters and participants in a way that new ideas and problems can be proposed, and the group takes on responsibility for a generative session.  In this format, problems (vexations) are dissected and their possible specific solutions (ventures) are proposed.  In this manner, the process of research and innovation is presented in a public forum in its early development stages, rather than after its completion, as would be the case in other [[academic conference]] formats.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J., Johnston, A., Meadows, L., Harkins, H., Kittleson, J. (2007, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/ASTE%202007workshop.pdf Professional Development at a Crossroads. Using Vexations as the Focal Point.] Workshop presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Clearwater, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants represent backgrounds from science and education, and represent perspectives from classroom teaching, policy, and research. This variety of perspectives allows each participant to tap into expertise that they might not otherwise encounter within the typical course of their professional lives. In this regard the metaphor of a [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] describes a [[culture]] and place where people can meet.

==History==
Crossroads originated from a disenchantment with more [[professional conference|traditional education conferences]].  As a consequence, Crossroads was designed, utilizing the [[Vexation and Venture]] format, to make generative discussions a deliberate feature of the conference.

Crossroads has a history of finding a specific place and space each year for conferring.  Oscillating from venue to venue has allowed each year to have its own character, as well as allow people from specific regions to have more access to the conference.  Crossroads has been held at the following venues:
* Storrs, CT (2005)
* Ogden, UT (2006)
* Amherst, MA (2007)
* Alta, UT (2008)
* Portland, OR (2009)
* San Antonio, TX (2011)
* Providence, RI (2012)
* Portlandia (2014)
* Cleveland, OH (2015)

Crossroads has a history of inviting poets as keynotes to its conferences.  These have included:
* [[Taylor Mali]] (2005)
* [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]], joined by [http://www.yurcic.com/ Jason Yurcic] (2006)
* [http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/97 Marilyn Nelson] (2007)
* [http://www.herondance.org/David-Lee-Poetry-W191C49.aspx David Lee] (2008)
* [[Lawson Fusao Inada]] (2009)
* [[Naomi Shihab Nye]] (2011)

Additionally, illustrator/artist/educator [http://www.fredlynch.com/ Fred Lynch] contributed the keynote address in 2012.

Crossroads has also established a line of work that has called for scholarly work in science education to reach out to create significant impact in education.  This has been referred to as "scholar activism" by David Moss, Crossroads' first keynote speaker in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, D. M. (2005). Toward scholar activism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, October 9–11, University of Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other speakers have included John Settlage in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J. (2006).  Prospects of pragmatism: The generation of science education adventurists.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 28–30, Ogden, UT.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Johnston in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. (2007). Orchestrations of Science Education Adventurism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 23–25, Amherst, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Carlone in 2008, and Magnia George in 2009.  Conference organizers have contributed joint addresses in 2011 and 2012.

==Future==
''Science Education at the Crossroads'' has moved its conference each fall, from east to west and back again, through the year 2009. Most notably, [[National Science Foundation]] funding was established to fund the conference from 2007 - 2009.  In 2010, the conference organizers are considering next steps for future sequences of the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7252">The '''seclusion of girls at puberty''' has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to [[Culture and menstruation|menstruation]], the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of [[ritual purification]] related to the sacred power of blood.&lt;ref name=benedict &gt;{{cite book|author = Benedict, Ruth|year = 2002|title = Cultural Sociology|editor=Spillman, Lyn|chapter= The Diversity of Cultures|page = 22|publisher  = Blackwell Publishers Ltd|isbn= 0-631-21652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These societies practised various [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=Broude20051 &gt;{{cite book|author= Broude, Ruth|year = 2005|title= The Birkshire Encyclopedia of World History|editor1-first=W.

==Rites==
[[File:Venus figurine cave of Laussel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Venus of Laussel]]]]
Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to [[Sir James George Frazer]], these rules also applied to [[divine king]]s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelureofnoma.com/?p=131|title=Seclusion of Girls – Evidence from Paleolithic Times?|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}} are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their [[adiposity]] (caused by seclusion).

Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:
* Once a girl from [[Zulu people|Zulu tribes]] in [[South Africa]] showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;{{cite book|author= Frazer, James|year = 1993|title = The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|chapter= Between Heaven and Earth|publisher  = Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn= 1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and in the Kabadi District of [[New Guinea]], pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
*In many societies, including [[Brahmin]]s of [[Bengal]], girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[California]] did not allow girls in their first menstruation to "look about". 
*Among the [[Tiyan]]s of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch "any other person, tree or plant".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
* Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she "is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power"&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|author= Lincoln, Bruce|year = 1981|title = Emerging from the Chrysalis: Studies in Rituals of Women's Initiation|publisher  = Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-24840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–52}}
Frazer believed that the Greek myth of [[Danaë]], who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by [[Zeus]], was related to girls' puberty rites.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;{{rp|602}} Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as "being in the underworld".&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Reasons for the seclusion==

===Preparation for womanhood===
Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.&lt;ref name=Broude20051 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker1905 &gt;{{cite book|author= Langloh Parker,  Katherine|authorlink=K. Langloh Parker |year = 1905|title= [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe|The Euahlayi Tribe]]: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia|chapter = [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe/Chapter 7#56|Birth—Betrothal—An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood]]|page=56-58|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstition===
Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the "deeply engrained dread" of "menstruous blood". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.

Among the [[Apache Indians]], "the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing".&lt;ref name=benedict /&gt; A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of "a degree of supernatural power" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the "power of evil".

The [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men "fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|606}}--&gt;

In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.&lt;ref name=Arachige2009 &gt;{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

      <comment>There was absolutely a rigidly enforced division. Women in ancient Greece rarely held public or political roles. One exception may be Aspasia of Miletus, who was a courtesan. Otherwise, most wives and daughters were largely confined to a secluded portion of the household known as the Gynaeceum.</comment>

Terms such as '''separate spheres''' and '''domestic–public dichotomy''' refer to a [[social phenomenon]], within [[modern society|modern societies]] that feature, to some degree, an [[empirical]] separation between a [[private sphere|domestic or private sphere]] and a [[Public sphere|public or social sphere]]. This observation may be  controversial, and is often also seen as supporting [[Patriarchy|patriarchal ideologies]] that seek to ''create or strengthen'', any such separation between spheres, and to confine women to the domestic/private sphere.

The patriarchal ideology of separate spheres, based primarily on notions of [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|biologically determined gender roles]]  and/or patriarchal religious doctrine, claims that women should avoid the public sphere &amp;ndash; the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and law. Women's "proper sphere", according to the ideology, is the realm of domestic life, focused on childcare, housekeeping, and religion.&lt;ref name="kuersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ryle |first1= Robyn |title= Questioning gender: a sociological exploration |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CHHz_p-j9hMC&amp;pg=PA342 |edition= |year= 2012 |publisher= SAGE/Pine Forge Press |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-6594-1 |pages= 342&amp;ndash;43|chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observable phenomena, however, the existence of separate spheres is much older.

==History==
The idea that women should inhabit a separate domestic sphere has been extant in [[Western thought]] for centuries, extending as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery | last2= |first2= |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

Brendan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over the "proper" roles of women and men continued throughout antiquity.

The modern ideology of separate spheres emerged in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory|last1=Wells|first1=Christopher|publisher=[[Routledge]]|others=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99802-4|editor1-last=Kowaleski-Wallace|editor1-first=Elizabeth|editor1-link=|location=London, New York|page=519|language=|chapter=Separate Spheres|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=blI0_52wIwYC&amp;pg=PA519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the industrialization of the Western world, family members worked side by side and the workplace was located mostly in and around the home. With the shift from home-based to factory production, men left the home to sell their labor for wages while women stayed home to perform unpaid domestic work. The separate spheres ideology reflected and fueled these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise encyclopedia of sociology|last1=Adams|first1=Michele|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|editor1-last=Ritzer|editor1-first=George|editor1-link=|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.; Malden, MA|pages=156&amp;ndash;57|chapter=Divisions of household labor|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=J. Michael|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Enlightenment and the French Revolution helped spread the ideas of liberty, equality, and political rights, but in practice such rights were denied to women, who were seen as belonging to a different social sphere. Feminist writers like Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lucy Stone demanded political equality for women as well as men and provided searing criticisms of the "separate sphere" ideals that confined women exclusively to the domestic sphere. Theorists such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] have argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the [[means of production]] and consequently became a private, separate sphere. As a result, Engels contended, women were excluded from participating directly in the production process and relegated to the subordinate domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to 19th-Century America|last1=Edwards|first1=Laura F.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-20985-0|editor1-last=Barney|editor1-first=William L.|editor1-link=|location=Malden, MA|pages=225&amp;ndash;226|chapter=Gender and the Changing Roles of Women|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=elgGfYla0hwC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major commentator on the modern idea of "separate spheres" was the French political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="kerber1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kerber |first1= Linda K. | authorlink1 = Linda K. Kerber | last2= |first2= |year= 1988 |title= Separate Spheres, Female Worlds, Woman's Place: The Rhetoric of Women's History |journal= [[The Journal of American History]] |volume= 75 |issue= 1 |pages= 9&amp;ndash;39|publisher= [[University of North Carolina Press]]|doi= 10.2307/1889653|url= |accessdate= |jstor= 1889653 }} Full text available [http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/separate_spheres.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1840), in a chapter entitled ''How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes'', Tocqueville wrote: "In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways that are always different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= Alexis de Tocqueville |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter XII: How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA101 |page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that married women, in particular, were subject to many restrictions, noting that "the independence of woman is irrecoverably lost in the bonds of matrimony", adding that "in the United States the inexorable opinion of the public carefully circumscribes woman within the narrow circle of domestic interests and duties and forbids her to step beyond it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter X: The young Woman in the Character of a Wife | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA79 |pages= 79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tocqueville considered the separate spheres of women and men a positive development,&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt; arguing:&lt;blockquote&gt;although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence, I have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position; and if I were asked...to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply,&amp;mdash;to the superiority of their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter XII: How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA106 |page= 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any "intrinsic" predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [[Cult of Domesticity|"Cult of True Womanhood"]], an ideal of [[femininity]] prevalent among the [[Upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es in the 19th century. "True women" were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Welter |first1= Barbara |authorlink1=  |last2=  |first2=  |year= 1966 |title= The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820–1860 |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–174 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi= 10.2307/2711179 |url= https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |accessdate=  |jstor= 2711179 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113000/https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |archivedate= 2011-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of the separate spheres ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt;

In [[Woman, Culture, and Society]] (1974), [[Michelle Rosaldo]] emphasizes the idea that these separate spheres can be explained in terms of a dichotomy, in the sense that these gender-oriented domains are viewed as so totally separate that it only reinforces the ideology of gender separation and inequality. Activities given to men, versus those assigned to women, were seen as having more value and contributing greatly to the society. Adversely, the woman's so-called simpler roles of housework and childrearing were held at a much lesser value. Rosaldo argues a "universal asymmetry" between the sexes that primarily caused these separations to arise. This model mainly focuses on the generational subordination of women in relation to men throughout history and across different cultures, defining the domestic and public spheres in very black and white terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:00972854|title=Woman, culture, and society|last=Rosaldo|first=Michelle Zimbalist|last2=Lamphere|first2=Louise|last3=Bamberger|first3=Joan|date=1974|isbn=0804708509|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier model, however, has since been challenged by researchers in the field, claiming the spheres cannot be outlined in such simplistic terms. Woman, Culture, and Society&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gender-in-cross-cultural-perspective/oclc/951536398?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F|date=2016|isbn=9780205247288|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-editor Louis Lamphere breaks down Rosaldo's model and discusses the spheres in different terms. Lamphere primarily dispels the concept of "universal asymmetry", looking toward various societies worldwide for proof. Even in some Middle Eastern cultures that place women in extreme positions of subordination, the model could not be so easily applied. This is because the domestic and public spheres are almost always overlapping in some way, regardless of a cultural female subservience or even egalitarianism. Women enter public spaces in order to fulfill certain duties that fall within their domestic responsibilities. Men must return to the private, or domestic, space eventually to bring home the spoils of his labor in the public sphere. In this sense, there are two separate spheres created and enforced by gender ideologies; but they are not dichotomous. They, instead, form an integrated system of life in society, varying only in levels of intensities from culture to culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to Cary Franklin, the women’s rights movements in the mid-1960s proposed that to achieve true equality between the sexes, it is necessary for the laws to be put in place to move past the simple separate spheres model and address the “interspherical impacts”. In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) pushed for equality of women in society and in the workplace and in order to attain this equality, there would have to be changes in family regulation. NOW stressed the importance of focusing on structurally altering the family sphere in order to then create gender equality in the education and workplace spheres. The family sphere is acting as a catalyst seeing that without a change in it, women would simply lack access to the opportunities that men already have available to them. Franklin also pointed out that the gender inequality among the American population in the 60’s and 70’s was a major contributor to the civil rights statutes of the Second Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/global/article/GALE%7CA376853033/165d132476e2721e8ea83c8ef676695a?u=txshracd2548|title=Redirect Page|website=bi.galegroup.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Rotman, an anthropologist at Notre Dame, analyzed this concept of separate spheres specifically among the people of Deerfield, Massachusetts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In this community, there was a clear divide between men and women by means of a “proper allocation” in which females were given the domestic residence or sphere and the men were given the “economically productive agricultural land”. Men would migrate away from the women if agriculture was depleting in their given agricultural space. As the men were moving to work outside the home, women began to acclimate to the economic atmosphere and gain more opportunities in the public sphere with all the men working elsewhere. These women soon had various roles in the public and private spheres in Deerfield. As equal rights began to become part of the ideological framework in Deerfield, women found themselves voting in school boards, working on municipal water projects and working in fundraisers as men had done before them. Despite the traditional understanding of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of completely separate public and private spheres, the Deerfield community challenged these “dichotomies of domesticity” and paved the way for equal rights for men and women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Influences==

===Biological determinism===
The separation between female and male spheres was heavily influenced by [[biological determinism]],&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Roy |first1= Anupama |title= Gendered citizenship: historical and conceptual explorations |chapter = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko4sVA2JRJUC&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orient Longman]] |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-250-2797-3| page= 80&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grana |first1= Sheryl J. |title= Women and justice |chapter = 'Nature' and Biology | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5IKdJLjtbtoC&amp;pg=PA20 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-7002-3| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion that women and men are naturally suitable for different social roles due to their biological and genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= Jodi |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of gender and society |volume= 2 | year= 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= Los Angeles |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 586, 602&amp;ndash;603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of biological determinism was popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and among such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argued that women were inherently different from men and should devote themselves to [[reproduction]] and domesticity.&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt; Women were considered passive, dependent on men, and, due to their reproductive capacity, ill-suited for life outside the domestic realm.&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Adams |first1= Michele | last2 = Coltrane | first2 = Scott | editor1-first= Michael S. |editor1-last= Kimmel |editor1-link= Michael Kimmel |editor2-first= Jeff | editor2-last= Hearn | editor3-last = Connell | editor3-first = Raewyn |title= Handbook of studies on men and masculinities |chapter = The Cultural Ideal of Separate Spheres| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UvAZD45BMDoC&amp;pg=PA231 |year= 2005 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London |isbn= 978-0-7619-2369-5| pages= 231&amp;ndash;32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau described women's primary duties in ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', stating that "women's entire education should be planned in relation to men. To please men, to be useful to them, to win their love and respect, to raise them as children, to care for them as adults, correct and console them, make their lives sweet and pleasant; these are women's duties in all ages and these are what they should be taught from childhood."&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt;

The popular beliefs about inherent sex differences remained deeply embedded in popular consciousness throughout the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beyond separate spheres: intellectual roots of modern feminism |last= Rosenberg |first= Rosalind |authorlink= Rosalind Rosenberg |coauthors= |year= 1982 |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |location= New Haven |isbn= 978-0-300-02695-5 |pages= 114, 207, 245&amp;ndash;46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DpZ0Yzs_Cj8C&amp;pg=PA114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, however, [[dissident]] [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and other [[Social science|social scientists]] began to challenge the biological determination of human behavior, revealing great similarities between men and women and suggesting that many sex differences were socially constructed.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt; Despite these new insights and social and economic changes such as women's entry into the labor force, the separate spheres ideology did not disappear.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt;

Women's confinement to the private sphere was reinforced by cultural and legal arrangements, such as the lack of [[women's suffrage]], legal prohibitions against women undertaking professions like medicine and law, and discouragement from obtaining higher education.&lt;ref name="kuersten"&gt;{{cite book | title= Women and the law: leaders, cases, and documents |chapter = Separate Spheres Doctrine |last= Kuersten |first= Ashlyn K. |authorlink=  |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |location= Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn= 978-0-87436-878-9 |pages= 16&amp;ndash;17 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=AnKGWlZG_ncC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong support for the separation of spheres came from [[antisuffragist]]s who relied on the notion of inherent sexual differences to argue that women were unfit for political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Marshall |first1= Susan E. | authorlink1 = | last2= |first2= |year= 1986 |title= In Defense of Separate Spheres: Class and Status Politics in the Antisuffrage Movement |journal= [[Social Forces]] |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 327&amp;ndash;51|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|doi= 10.1093/sf/65.2.327|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hewitt |first1= Lyndi | last2 = McCammon | first2 = Holly J. | editor1-first= Hank |editor1-last= Johnston |editor1-link=  |editor2-first= John A. | editor2-last= Noakes |title= Frames of protest: social movements and the framing perspective |chapter = Explaining the suffrage mobilization: balance, neutralization, and range in collective action frames | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iUZe1lLP-FcC&amp;pg=PA39 |year= 2005 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-3806-1| page= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antifeminism|Antifeminist]] men's groups in late 19th and early 20th century United States responded to the societal changes and shift in gender relations by advocating a return to a strict separation of spheres that would keep women from competing with men in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Kimmel |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Kimmel |title= Men's responses to feminism at the turn of the century |journal= [[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 261&amp;ndash;283 |doi= 10.1177/089124387001003003|year= 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] supported the separate spheres ideology and opposed women's suffrage as well as other attempts to broaden women's influence in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter= Conservative Protestantism and the Separate Spheres | title= Ungodly women: gender and the first wave of American fundamentalism |last= DeBerg |first= Betty A.|year= 1990 |publisher= [[Augsburg Fortress]] |location= Minneapolis |isbn= 978-0-8006-2439-2 |pages= 43&amp;ndash;58 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkRgooQLV0C&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological conservatism has been found to have a stable effect on the endorsement of separate spheres ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bartkowski |first1= John P. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Xiaohe | editor1-first= Christopher G. |editor1-last= Ellison |editor1-link=  |editor2-first= Robert A. | editor2-last= Hummer |title= Religion, families, and health: population-based research in the United States |chapter = Religion and Family Values Reconsidered: Gender Traditionalism among Conservative Protestants | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5rvZ4hnClO8C&amp;pg=PA106 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]] |location= New Brunswick, N.J. |isbn= 978-0-8135-4945-3| pages= 106&amp;ndash;125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] propagated a view of womanhood which reinforced gendered division.&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Cathy | authorlink1 = | last2= |first2= |year= 2006 |title= Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions? |journal= [[Transformation (journal)|Transformation]] |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 228&amp;ndash;35|publisher= SAGE Publications |doi= 10.1177/026537880602300406 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gisborne]]'s ''An Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex'' (1797) and [[Henry Venn (Clapham Sect)|Henry Venn]]'s ''The Complete Duty of Man'' (1763) were two popular evangelical texts which described proper behavior for men and women, arguing that a woman's primary duty was to care for those in her domestic circle and obey her husband.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

==Effects==
In her paper "Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions", Cathy Ross suggests that the separate spheres ideology had ambiguous effects on women's lives.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt; She argues that while it "was clear that women were supposed to be subordinate and that home and children were their sphere", the separation of spheres enabled women "to reach out to other women in sisterhood, in solidarity, on the common ground of domesticity".&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

The ideology of separate spheres contributed to resistance to [[coeducation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]|location=New York|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the emergence of gendered educational institutions such as the [[female seminary]] and [[women's college]] in [[higher education]], and the [[woman's club]] in [[continuing education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's club movement|first=Christine|last=Woyshner|page=477|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[teaching]] as a woman's profession was also closely linked to the ideology of separate spheres, as women came to be regarded as uniquely skilled at [[classroom management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|pages=48, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coeducational universities in the late 19th century, the separation of spheres contributed to the emergence of [[home economics]] as a field of advanced study for the woman's sphere,&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; and the [[dean of women]] as frequently the only high-ranking woman administrator in coeducational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=How Deans of Women Became Men | first=Robert Arthur  | last=Schwartz | journal=[[The Review of Higher Education]] | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=1997 | doi=10.1353/rhe.1997.0011 | page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it created a space for women's academic and professional advancement, the separation of spheres also provided an excuse for keeping women out of fields not specifically marked as female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Tolley | first= Kim | title= The Science Education of American Girls | year= 2003 | isbn=978-0-415-93472-5 | publisher= RoutledgeFalmer |location= New York| page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many talented woman scientists were pushed into professorships in home economics rather than in their principal fields.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Melissa|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8|chapter=Home Economics|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women educators resisted this typecasting even while working within the framework of separation. [[Frances Shimer]], founder of [[Shimer College]], which was a woman's school from 1866 to 1950, insisted that she was "in favor of the co-education of the sexes" and that the education at her school was equal to what was given to young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='My whole ambition has ever been to do something smart': Frances Wood Shimer, Cinderella Gregory, and the 1853 Founding of Shimer College|first=Doris |last=Malkmus|journal=Journal of Illinois History|volume=6|issue=3|pages=212&amp;ndash;213|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Commentary ==
A recent study by Jacqueline Henke explores the history of the separate spheres model in America. Henke points out that between 1820 and 1860 (a period sometimes called the dawn of separate spheres) three parenting models were common for two-parent, mother/father families:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Parenting duties are wholly the responsibility of mothers
&lt;br&gt;
2. Parenting duties are separated into fatherly responsibilities and motherly responsibilities
&lt;br&gt;
3. Parenting duties are shared equally among mothers and fathers.
&lt;br&gt;
According to Henke, many parenting books from this era suggested that mothers should take primary responsibility for their children. Yet, some parenting books argued that mothers and fathers should have separate childrearing duties or a completely equal distribution of childrearing responsibilities. Henke argues that, even during the height of domestic ideology and the dawn of separate spheres, parenting advice was not monolithic. Furthermore, the lived realities parents and families during this era were more diverse than the ideals of parenting books.

{{sociology}}

The '''sociology of emotion''' applies [[sociological]] theorems and techniques to the study of human [[emotions]]. As sociology emerged primarily as a reaction to the negative effects of [[modernity]], many [[normative]] theories deal in some sense with emotion without forming a part of any specific subdiscipline: [[Karl Marx]] described [[capitalism]] as detrimental to personal '[[species-being]]', [[Georg Simmel]] wrote of the deindividualizing tendencies of 'the metropolis', and [[Max Weber]]'s work dealt with the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalizing]] effect of modernity in general.

==Theory==
Emotions are on one hand constitutive of, embedded in, and on the other hand manipulated or instrumentalized by entities that are studied by sociology on a micro level, such as social roles and norms and 'feeling rules' the everyday social interactions and situations are shaped by, and, on a macro level, by social institutions, discourses, ideologies etc. For example, (post-)modern marriage is, on one hand, based on the emotion of love and on the other hand the very emotion is to be worked on and regulated by it. Likewise, modern science could not exist without the emotion of curiosity but it does narrow it leading sometimes to over-specialization of science. Many forms of cultural stratification could not exist without disgust and contempt, and there are politics that could not exist without fear, as many civil and ethnic wars could not take place without hate. (requires citation)

We try to regulate our feelings to fit in with the norms of the situation, based on many - sometimes conflicting - demands upon us. Systematic observations of group interaction found that a substantial portion of group activity is devoted to the socio-emotional issues of expressing affect and dealing with tension.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, A. P. (1976). ''Handbook of small group research'' (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, field studies of social attraction in groups revealed that feelings of individuals about each other collate into social networks,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, A. P. (1976). ''Handbook of small group research'' (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; a discovery that still is being explored in the field of [[social network]] analysis. 

[[Ethnomethodology]] revealed emotional commitments to everyday norms through purposeful breaching of the norms. For example, students acting as boarders in their own homes reported others' astonishment, bewilderment, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, and anger; family members accused the students of being mean, inconsiderate, selfish, nasty, or impolite. Actors who breach a norm themselves feel waves of emotion, including apprehension, panic, and despair.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, S. (1974, ). An interview with Carol Tavris. ''Psychology Today'', pp. 70-73&lt;/ref&gt; However, habitual rule breaking leads to declining stress, and may eventually end in enjoyment. 

T. David Kemper&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, T. D. (1978). ''A social interactional theory of emotion''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that people in social interaction have positions on two relational dimensions: status and power. Emotions emerge as interpersonal events change or maintain individuals' status and power. For example, affirming someone else's exalted status produces love-related emotions.  Increases or decreases in one's own and other's status or power generate specific emotions whose quality depends on the patterns of change. 

[[Arlie Hochschild]]&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. R. (1983). ''The managed heart: The commercialization of human feeling''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that individuals manage their feelings to produce acceptable displays according to ideological and cultural standards. Hochschild showed that jobs often require such [[emotional labor]]. Her classic study of emotional labor among flight attendants found that an industry speed-up, reducing contact between flight attendants and passengers, made it impossible for flight attendants to deliver authentic emotional labor, so they ended up surface-acting superficial smiles. Peggy Thoits&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1990). Emotional deviance: research agendas. T. D. Kemper (Ed.), ''Research agendas in the sociology of emotions'' (pp. 180–203). Albany: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; divided emotion management techniques into implementation of new events and reinterpretation of past events. Thoits noted that emotions also can be managed with drugs, by performing faux gestures and facial expressions, or by cognitive reclassifications of one's feelings.

Sociologist Chris Lucerne states in her article titled “Emotions! Good or Bad”, that there are neither good nor bad emotions. However, you can judge emotions as such. According to Lucerne's theory emotion is believed to help humans express their feelings. Therefore, emotions are a part of human nature to help us communicate. In addition to Chris Lucerne’s theory, when humans experience a situation good or bad an emotion is triggered. As a result of emotion an action is followed. For example, here are a few emotions listed in Lucerne’s article in which people experience daily. The first is the emotion of happiness, which can ignite the sensation to dance. A second emotion is anger, in which the person begins to feel hot causing him or her to perspire. Finally is the emotion of sadness, which creates a sensation of feeling closed in. As a consequence of feeling closed in the person may react irrationally to make them comfortable. Chris Lucerne also states in her article "that no matter what, you cannot control your reactions to emotion." In conclusion to Lucerne's theory, reaction is random in expressing your feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrislucerne.com/pdfs/emotions.pdf Microso&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107091706/http://www.chrislucerne.com/pdfs/emotions.pdf |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Straker states that "we should watch our own emotions", likewise in Arlie Hochschild's theory of emotions. Straker talks about how emotions are signals that tell you something about what is happening in the inner you. Sometimes bad emotions can be misleading because of the reaction often causing conflict. To conclude based on Straker's theory, you can use emotions for good or bad. An example Straker talked about was the use of emotion to motivate others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changeminds.org/explanations/emotions/emotion_purpose.htm Purpose of emotions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas J. Scheff&lt;ref&gt;Scheff, Thomas J, and  Retzinger, Suzanne. (1991) ''Emotions and violence : shame and rage in destructive conflicts''. Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books&lt;/ref&gt; established that many cases of social conflict are based on a destructive and often escalating, but stoppable and reversible shame-rage cycle: when someone results or feels shamed by another, their social bond comes under stress. This can be cooperatively acknowledged, talked about and – most effectively when possible - laughed at so their social bond may be restored. Yet, when shame is not acknowledged, but instead negated and repressed, it becomes rage, and rage may drive to aggressive and shaming actions that feed-back negatively on this self-destructive situation. The social management of emotions might be the fundamental dynamics of social cooperation and conflict around resources, complexity, conflict and moral life. It is well-established sociological fact that expression and feeling of the emotion of anger, for example, is strongly discouraged (repressed) in girls and women in many cultures, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Some cultures and sub-cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, jealousy, excitedness, and many other emotions. The free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in many countries. 

Sociologist [[Randall Collins]] has stated that emotional energy is the main motivating force in social life, for love and hatred, investing, working or consuming, rendering cult or waging war.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Randall. (2004) ''Interaction Ritual Chains''. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional energy ranges from the highest heights of enthusiasm, self-confidence and initiative to the deepest depths of apathy, depression and retreat. Emotional energy comes from variously successful or failed chains of interaction rituals, that is, patterned social encounters –from conversation or sexual flirtation through [[Christmas]] family dinners or office work to mass demonstrations, organizations or revolutions. In the latter, the coupling of participants' behavior synchronizes their [[nervous system]]s to the point of generating a [[collective effervescence]], one observable in their mutual focus and emotional entraining (incorrect use of word, "entraining"), as well as in their loading of emotional and symbolic meaning to entities which subsequently become emblems of the ritual and of the membership group endorsing, preserving, promoting and  defending them. Thus social life would be most importantly about generating and distributing emotional energy. 

[[Affect Control Theory]], originated by [[David R. Heise]], proposes that social actions are designed by their agents to create impressions that befit sentiments reigning in a situation. Emotions are transient physical and subjective states depending on the current impression of the emoting person, and on the comparison of that impression with the sentiment attached to the person's identity. As such, emotions are visceral signals to self and observable signals to others about the individual's identity in the situation, and about the individual's understanding of events in the situation. Heise developed a [[simulation]] program for analyzing affect-control processes in social interaction, and for predicting moment-to-moment emotions of interactants. The program specifies emotions in terms of numerical profiles, emotion words, and cartoon-like drawings of interactants' facial expressions. A complete review of affect control theory is provided in Heise's 2007 book, ''Expressive Order''.&lt;ref&gt;Heise, David. (2007) ''Expressive Order: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions''. New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical applications ==

Workplaces. Following Hochschild's lead, the sociology of emotions has been applied extensively to a variety of workplace interactions. Jennifer Pierce, a student of Hochschild's, has examined law firms, for instance, and Robin Leidner the emotion work in fast food outlets.

Social Movements. Inspired by [[James M. Jasper]]'s cultural work in the late 1990s, especially The Art of Moral Protest, a number of scholars of protest and social movements have begun to examine the emotions involved. They include Erika Summers Effler, a student of [[Randall Collins]] who examines how emotions inform a sense of time in Laughing Saints and Righteous Heroes; Lynn Owens, who documents the emotions of a declining social movement, Amsterdams's squatters, in Cracking under Pressure; and Verta Taylor, whose book, Rock-a-Bye Baby documents struggles over the feelings new mothers are supposed to feel. Deborah Gould traces a number of emotional processes throughout the rise and fall of ACT UP in a series of articles and a book, Moving Politics. A 1999 conference, organized by [[James M. Jasper]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], and Francesca Polletta, helped spur this new development in social movement theory and research. Scholars worldwide have taken up the challenge to study the emotions of social movements, including a cluster of French researchers such as Olivier Fillieule, Isabelle Sommier, and Christophe Traini.

==As a measure of religiosity==
According to the sociologist [[Mervin F. Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], emotion may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. Furthermore, religious emotion may be broken down into four dimensions:

* Content
* Frequency
* Intensity
* Centrality

The content of one's religious emotions may vary from situation to situation, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person (frequency), the intensity of the emotion, and the centrality of the emotional feeling (in that religious tradition, or person's life).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, emotion is somewhat similar to [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s "experience" dimension of religiosity (Glock, 1972: 39).&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">'''Somnophilia''' (from [[Latin]] "somnus" = sleep and [[Greek language|Greek]] φιλία, "-philia" = love), also known as '''sleeping princess syndrome'''&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; and '''sleeping beauty syndrome''',&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual becomes [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by someone who is [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flora"&gt;Flora 2001, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexology]] scholar [[John Money]] stated that the condition has a high degree of correlation throughout history with [[incest]] and may progress to [[necrophilia]].&lt;ref name="money21" /&gt;  ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' categorized somnophilia within the classification of predatory paraphilias.&lt;ref name="corsini747" /&gt;

==Origin==
The term ''somnophilia'' was coined by John Money in 1986.&lt;ref name="carey"&gt;Carey 2014, p. D7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laws"&gt;Laws 2008, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized the condition as a type of [[sexual fetishism]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; Money described it as a type of syndrome: "of the marauding-predatory type in which erotic arousal and facilitation or attainment of orgasm are responsive to and dependent on intruding upon" someone who is unable to respond.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="money270"&gt;Money 1986, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that often the condition then subsequently involves the individual waking the unresponsive sexual partner after the act has been committed.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="money270" /&gt; 

According to Money, somnophilia may progress to [[necrophilia]], the desire to have sexual relations with a dead body.&lt;ref name="money55" /&gt; He characterized it as a form of "stealth and stealing paraphilias" including [[kleptophilia]].&lt;ref name="money92"&gt;Money 1986, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Money wrote that somnophilia has a high degree of correlation with acts of [[incest]] throughout history.&lt;ref name="money21"&gt;Money 1986, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse may follow from the condition including use of force or [[Kidnapping|abduction]].&lt;ref name="money55"&gt;Money 1986, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the individual upon whom the sex act is committed by the somnophiliac is a stranger not previously known intimately to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nusbaum 2005, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The somnophiliac may create an unconscious state in the victim by drugging them, or may engage in sex with someone who is inebriated or asleep.&lt;ref name="ferguson139"&gt;Ferguson 2010, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator becomes attracted to the idea of a sexual participant who is unable to resist their advances.&lt;ref name="ferguson139" /&gt;

''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' classified the term in 2000 under DSM-IV TR code 302.9 and in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] under [[ICD-10]] code F65.9.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 2010, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' categorized somnophilia within the classification of predatory paraphilias.&lt;ref name="corsini747"&gt;Corsini 2001, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Physicians have attempted to treat somnophilia with forms of [[psychotherapy]], as well as with medications used for [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; However, [[James Cantor]], psychologist and editor-in-chief of ''[[Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment]]'' stated: "There are occasional claims for treatment, but no one has presented meaningful, compelling evidence that someone with a paraphilia can be turned into someone without a paraphilia. As far as we can tell, it’s like sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; The condition can be thought of as a fetish or sexual preference which could be incorporated into a healthy partnership based upon consent.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; Somnophilia rises to the level of [[diagnosis]] when it causes "significant impairment", specifically, when the individual performing the sex act does so with a partner who does not give their consent.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Somnophilia has presented itself as a recurring phenomenon in [[popular culture]], including in the [[French film]] influenced by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movies, ''[[Who Killed Bambi? (2003 film)|Who Killed Bambi?]]'' ({{lang-fr|Qui a tué Bambi ?}}).&lt;ref name="ferguson156"&gt;Ferguson 2010, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the [[horror film]] involves a surgeon who drugs his female patients in order to subsequently engage in sexual intercourse with them without their consent.&lt;Ref name="ferguson156" /&gt; The assailant resorts to [[murder]] after one of the women wakes up from her unconscious state as he begins to remove her clothing.&lt;ref name="ferguson156" /&gt; The title character attempts to warn the board of directors at the hospital of the murderer's activity.&lt;ref name="ferguson156" /&gt;

The '''T.M.C. Asser Instituut''' (established in 1965) is a professional inter-university centre of knowledge and research. The institute carries out research in private and public international law, European law, international commercial arbitration and all other related fields, such as international sports law and international humanitarian and criminal law. It is based in [[The Hague]] and it is affiliated to the [[University of Amsterdam]].

The institute is named after [[Tobias Michael Carel Asser]] (1838–1913), who was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] jurist, and co-winner (with [[Alfred Fried]]) of the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]] in 1911 for his role in the formation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the first Hague peace conference (1899). He also advocated for the creation of an international academy of law, which led to founding of the ''Revue de Droit International et de Législation Comparée'' with [[John Westlake]] and [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], the [[Institut de Droit International]] and the creation of the [[Hague Academy of International Law]].

==Fundamental research==
Besides the research facilities for its team of expert researchers, the Institute has access to an extensive international network of academic and scientific contacts. The T.M.C. Asser Instituut aims to develop young talent. The Asser Dissertations Programme offers promising young lawyers the opportunity to work on their research.
The funding and appointment of new candidates is done in collaboration with other institutions, preferably law faculties.

==Contract-research and legal advice==
Besides fundamental research, the institute focuses on contract research and consultancy work. This ranges from tailored consultancy finding (ad hoc) solutions for small legal issues to coordination and/or export of long-term structural (research) projects. Clients include among others the [[European Union]], national governments, ministries, international organizations, and law firms.

==Publisher==
The institute has its own [[publisher]]: [[T.M.C. Asser Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asser.nl/asserpress/|title=Asser Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.asser.nl/asserpress|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bible with Sources Revealed''''' (2003) is a book by American biblical scholar [[Richard Elliott Friedman]] dealing with the process by which the five books of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]] (the "Five Books of Moses") came to be written. Friedman follows the four-source [[Documentary Hypothesis]] model, but differs significantly from [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s model in several respects. 

Most notably, Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the date of the [[Deuteronomist]] (the court of [[Josiah]], c. 621 or 622 BC), but places the [[Priestly source]] at the court of [[Hezekiah]]; his sequence of sources therefore runs [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]]–[[Deuteronomist]] [JEPD] (while Wellhausen order it as [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Deuteronomist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]] [JEDP] in his Documentary Hypothesis model). Like Wellhausen, he sees a final redaction in the time of [[Ezra]], c. 450 BC.

== Summary ==

The core of the book, taking up almost 300 of its approximately 380 pages in the paperback edition, is Friedman's own translation of the five Pentateuchal books, in which the four sources plus the contributions of the two [[Redactor]]s (of the combined JE source and the later redactor of the final document) are indicated typographically. The remaining sections include a short Introduction outlining Friedman's thesis, a "Collection of Evidence," and a bibliography.

Friedman's version of the documentary hypothesis can be summarised as follows: The first source to be written down was the Jahwist, or J. This occurred in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the southern of the two Israelite kingdoms, in the period between 922-722 BC. (Friedman's arguments are dealt with below). The Elohist, or E, was composed in roughly the same period, but probably a little later than J, in the northern kingdom of Israel. In 722 BC the Assyrian conquest of Israel brought E to Judah with refugees from the northern kingdom.

Shortly after this a redactor combined the two into a standard text, JE, the redactor himself being known as RJE. Then in the reign of [[Hezekiah]], c.715-687 BC, the Jerusalem priesthood produced a text which they saw as a replacement for JE, the theology of which was objectionable to their project of religious reform: this was the Priestly source, or P. Hezekiah's reform program failed, but was revived in the reign of his great-grandson [[Josiah]], c. 640-609 BC, producing the last source, the [[Deuteronomist]], or D. The three sources (JE now counting as a single source) existed independently until the return from the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], when a final redactor, R, combined them. 

The "Collection of Evidence" section sets out Friedman's arguments for the documentary hypothesis in general and for his own version of it in particular. He notes seven arguments:
* Linguistic: each source (treating JE as a single source) reflects the Hebrew of its period.
* Terminology: Certain words and phrases appear disproportionately, or exclusively, in certain sources.
* Consistent content: Certain concepts, objects, and practices are specific to certain sources.
* Continuity of texts: When separated into sources following linguistic, terminological and contextual clues, each source constitutes a coherent, self-contained narrative.
* Connections with other parts of the Bible: Each source has direct, non-indiscriminate affinities with other specific parts of the Bible.
* Relationships of sources to each other and to history: The sources each have connections to specific circumstances in the history of Israel/Judah, and to each other.

== Comparison with Wellhausen ==

As Friedman himself says in his ''Who Wrote the Bible?'', when a scholar agrees with the documentary hypothesis, he agrees with Wellhausen; when he wishes to propose a new model of the hypothesis, he compares it with Wellhausen.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase from Friedman's "Who Wrote the Bible?", pp. 26-27 of 1997 edition (original edition 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the identity of the four sources, and on the identification of certain possible or probable authors: [[Jeremiah]] and/or his scribe, [[Baruch ben Neriah]], as the author of D, [[Ezra]] as the Redactor. (These identifications in fact were made long before Wellhausen: the identification of the Redactor with Ezra can be traced to [[Spinoza]] in the 17th century or even [[Jerome]] in the 4th). Where he departs most radically from Wellhausen is in dating P to the time of Hezekiah, almost a century before Josiah and the D source. Wellhausen's placing of P after D, so that the sequence of sources was JEDP, was crucial to the view of the development of Israelite religion from original polytheism to Judaic monotheism; Friedman's reordering of the sources is thus his major challenge to Wellhausen's model, as it undermines Wellhausen's thesis that the [[Priestly Code]] represents the final development of a priest-centred religious practice. Friedman's dating of J to the time of the divided kingdom - Wellhausen put it in the 10th century BC rather than the 8th - is also novel, but less so than his ordering of the sources.

== Critical assessment ==

The documentary hypothesis as defined by Wellhausen, having dominated critical thinking on the origin of the Pentateuch, came into increasing question from the late 1960s onwards as alternative models - supplementary and fragmentary rather than the discrete documents of the DH paradigm - were put forward. Friedman's book is thus in one sense an answer to these critics, and perhaps especially to [[R. N. Whybray]], whose 1987 ''[[The Making of the Pentateuch]]'' had concluded that the tools by which the documentary model distinguished its supposed documents were fundamentally faulty: how could they suppose, he asked, that the authors of each of the four so-called source documents had not tolerated inconsistency, but that the two redactors had had no problems with it? 

Scholars as eminent as [[Baruch Halpern]] and [[Michael D. Coogan]] (editor of ''[[The New Oxford Annotated Bible]]'') welcomed ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'' as an indispensable teaching tool; nevertheless, Friedman's departures from Wellhausen have been criticised by his professional colleagues on several grounds, not least for ignoring all other models and all advances in scholarship outside his preferred documentary model.

For example, the review in the [[Review of Biblical Literature]] noted:

"It is basic for the understanding of biblical literary history that the [[Supplementary hypothesis|Supplementary Hypothesis]] is the 'normal hypothesis' (even within the Pentateuch) and that the Documentary Hypothesis (i.e., the fusion of two literary sources) is only a notable exception."

Also, some scholars advocated 'the Fragmentary hypothesis' for another major text-critical approach to the Pentateuch's authorship''.

Moreover, Friedman was criticised for ignoring evidence that P did not precede Deuteronomy, for an arbitrary approach to his assignment of sources, and for failing to note or argue with scholarship that does not support his argument.

On the other hand, his close examination of R (and RJE) was welcomed as innovative and useful, as was his schematisation of the arguments in favour of the documentary model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/5126_5394.pdf Review by Christof Levin, ''Review of Biblical Literature'', RBL06/2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warner and Swasey Observatory''' is the astronomical [[observatory]] of [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Named after [[Worcester R. Warner]] and [[Ambrose Swasey]], who built it at the beginning of the 20th century, it was initially located on Taylor Road in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA.  The observatory, which at that time housed a {{convert|9.5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[refracting telescope|refractor]], was donated in 1919 to the Case School of Applied Science. The newer {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} Burrell [[Schmidt telescope]] was built in 1939.

Due to rising [[light pollution]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], a new station in [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga County]]'s [[Montville Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Montville Township]] was established in 1950s. Named after [[Jason John Nassau]], the station initially housed the Burrell telescope, which was later moved to [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]. Instead of Burrell the station was equipped with the 36-inch robotic telescope. In 2008 Nassau Station was sold to the [[Geauga Park District]] and subsequently incorporated into its Observatory Park.

The observatory currently operates the old 9.5-inch refractor (now known as the rooftop telescope) at the university's [[University Circle]] campus, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in [[Arizona]]. The old site on Taylor Road was sold in 1983.

==History==
[[Image:Warner and Swasey Observatory.jpg|thumb|upright|The Taylor Road facility of the Warner and Swasey Observatory]]

The observatory was originally built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]], which made precision instruments and [[telescope]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to [[Case Institute of Technology]]), and built an observatory in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four miles east of the university campus and housed a 9.5-inch [[refracting telescope|refractor]], and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of [[Walker and Weeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Cleveland Legacy: The Architecture of Walker and Weeks |last=Johannesen |first=Eric |date=1998 |publisher=Kent State University Press |location=Kent, Ohio |isbn=0-87338-589-6 |pages=87–88 |url=http://upress.kent.edu/books/Johannesen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public lecture hall.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|last=Claspy|first=William|publisher=Warner and Swasey Observatory, Case Western Reserve University|title=History of the Warner and Swasey Observatory|url=http://astrwww.cwru.edu/history.shtml|date=2006|accessdate=2009-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509072403/http://astrwww.cwru.edu/history.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, it became apparent that the [[light pollution]] from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga County]], known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In 1978, the Astronomy Department of [[Case Western Reserve University]] made a deal with the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] (AURA) to build a new observatory at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from [[Ohio]] to [[Arizona]] in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch [[reflecting telescope|reflector]] on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a [[House|residence]].&lt;ref name=flipline&gt;{{cite web|title=The History....|url=http://www.flipline.com/wso/history.html|accessdate=2009-08-18|publisher=The Warner &amp; Swasey Observatory Restoration project|last=Elek|first=Tim|last2=Neff|first2=Matt|last3=Solary|first3=Tony|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704065403/http://flipline.com/wso/history.html|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=O'Malley |title=Family's New Focus: Turning Old Observatory Into Home |url=http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?/whateverhappened/more/observatory.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607163203/http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fwhateverhappened%2Fmore%2Fobservatory.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of [[mortgage fraud]] and sent to prison in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=O'Malley |title=Nayyir Al Mahdi's dream of turning observatory into home ended with indictment |url=http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?/whateverhappened/more/nayyir.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607163303/http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fwhateverhappened%2Fmore%2Fnayyir.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Warner &amp; Swasey Observatory at Kitt Peak National Observatory.jpg|thumb|The Warner and Swasey Observatory at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]]]

===Burrell Schmidt Telescope===
The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was originally built in 1939 by [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] and was housed at the Taylor Road facility.&lt;ref name=Nassau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nassau|first=J.J.|title=The Burrell telescope of the Warner and Swasey Observatory|date=1945|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=101|pages=275–279|doi=10.1086/144719|bibcode=1945ApJ...101..275N}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] near [[Tucson, Arizona]]. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded with a very wide field of view [[CCD array]], which is much more sensitive than the [[photographic plate]]s. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.&lt;ref name=NewsLetter&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Camera Sees "First Light" on Burrell Schmidt Telescope|url=http://astroweb.case.edu/news/Newsletter092008.pdf|format=pdf|date=September 2008|journal=Astronomy Department Newsletter|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nassau Station Robotic Observatory===
The Nassau Station, originally constructed in the 1950s, currently houses a 36-inch reflecting telescope. It is named after observatory director [[Jason John Nassau]], who was a prominent astronomer at the time.&lt;ref name=Griffith&gt;{{cite web|first=S.|last=Griffith|date=1997|title=Observatory Upgrades Planned as 40th Anniversary arrives|url=http://www.cwru.edu/pubs/cnews/1997/10-2/observ40.htm?nw_view=1250781578&amp;|accessdate=2009-08-20|publisher=Case Western Reserve University}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work was carried out in the 1990s to make the telescope capable of remote viewing, making it one of the first telescopes to be used in this manner.&lt;ref name=Sciencedaily&gt;{{cite news|title=CWRU's Nassau Telescope Goes Online In December For Public Use|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/12/981203075623.htm|accessdate=2009-08-20|date=3 December 1998|work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was seldom used by Case astronomers due to increased light pollution from Cleveland and the enhanced capabilities of the Burrell Schmidt. As a result, the observatory was left unused for several years until 2008, when it was sold to the [[Geauga Park District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Geauga Park District purchases Nassau Observatory from Case Western Reserve University |url=http://blog.case.edu/case-news/2008/10/09/nassauobservatory |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park district reopened the facility as part of its Observatory Park on June 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Rusek |title=Geauga's Observatory Park Opens Early for Historic View of Venus |url=http://www.cleveland.com/west-geauga/index.ssf/2012/06/post_43.html |work=[[Sun Newspapers|Sun News]] |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Lundblad |title=Geauga Park District's Observatory Park Helps Visitors See the Stars |url=http://www.news-herald.com/articles/2012/11/25/news/nh6261754.txt |work=[[The News-Herald (Ohio)|The News-Herald]] |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was designated as a dark sky park by the [[International Dark Sky Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Mangels |title=$2 million Geauga park would preserve a patch of dark sky |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/02/2_million_geauga_park_would_pr.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rooftop Telescope===
The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch refractor that was originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey for their own use.&lt;ref name=flipline/&gt; The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome on the roof of the A. W. Smith building.&lt;ref name=Cuyahoga&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio's Observatories: CWRU Observatories|url=http://www.cuyastro.org/ohioobs.html|accessdate=2009-08-18|publisher=Cuyahoga Astronomical Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913064335/http://www.cuyastro.org/ohioobs.html|archivedate=2009-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telescope remains in excellent condition today and is available for use by all students, faculty, and staff at CWRU once they go through a seminar on proper telescope use.&lt;ref name=Cuyahoga/&gt; It is also often used for public observing nights by the university's Physics and Astronomy Club.

Observers using the Warner and Swasey Observatory have made important contributions to astronomical research.  An early example is work carried out by the observatory's then director, Jason Nassau, on the classification of [[carbon star]]s and [[stellar classification|M-type stars]] in 1949;&lt;ref name=Blanco&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanco|first=Victor M.|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–18|date=September 2001|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.astro.39.1.1?cookieSet=1#h4|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.39.1.1|title=Telescopes, red stars, and Chilean skies|bibcode=2001ARA&amp;A..39....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently, observations made using the Burrell Schmidt telescope led to the discovery of the galaxy [[Andromeda VIII]] in 2003. This galaxy orbits the more famous [[Andromeda Galaxy]], and was previously undiscovered due to its position in front of the bright disk of the parent galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=H.L.|author2=Harding, P. |author3=Hurley-Keller, D. |author4= Jacoby, G. |date=2003|title=Andromeda VIII: A New Tidally Distorted Satellite of M31|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=596|issue=2|pages=L183–L186|bibcode=2003ApJ...596L.183M|doi= 10.1086/379625|arxiv = astro-ph/0309254 }}  ([http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/cwru0301.html Observatory press release])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burrell Schmidt has also recently been used to image the intracluster light in the [[Virgo Supercluster]].  The intracluster light is a thousand times fainter than the night sky, and was observed after combining seventy images of the cluster which were taken with the Burrell Schmidt telescope.&lt;ref name=Virgo&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihos|first=C.|display-authors=etal |date=2005|title=Diffuse Light in the Virgo Supercluster|url=http://astroweb.case.edu/hos/Virgo/|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wee Wee Caye Marine Lab''' is located in the country of [[Belize]].

[[File:Wee wee caye.jpg|300px|thumb|Mode of transportation and view of surrounding dock area, March 2010]]

[[File:Wee wee caye 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Sustainable building practice that supports ecological health and proper filtration: Boardwalks prevent [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]], [[erosion]], and [[Ecosystem health|ecological damage]], all the while providing significant habitat to a variety of [[wildlife]]. Contrasts significantly to local islands, whose [[artificial beach]]es negatively impact natural [[reef]] ecosystems.]]

This biological lab, established in 1988, is located nine miles off the coast of southern Belize in the [[Stann Creek District]].  Wee Wee Caye, the island upon which this lab is situated, is host only to this biological station, which is managed in a sustainable fashion.  [[Mangrove]]s surround the entirety of the island, and provides not only erosion control to the island, but additionally provides habitat that supports a wide variety of [[fauna]].

Currently owned by two American citizens and [[researcher]]s, Paul and Mary Shave, this lab employs individuals from local communities in [[Dangriga]] when visitors are present.  The lab acts as a support facility to academic programs interested in marine, coastal, and tropical ecological studies.  Mode of transportation to and from the island include [[fiberglass]] boats operated by licensed guides.  Rustic [[Log cabin|cabin]]s provide housing to visitors, and meals are served three times a day and are prepared by local cooks.  [[Boardwalk]]s connect cabins within the mangrove forest in order to prevent compaction and damage to the surrounding environment.

Many local islands within the surrounding area have altered the natural mangrove forest that typically surrounds these islands with artificial sand beaches, so as to better serve the desires of foreign [[tourist]]s.  However, this "beach" system not only decreases the natural habitat of a variety of species, but it also infringes on the health of the [[coral reef]], covering many areas of the coral reef and causing death to local marine wildlife.  Erosion is also significantly enhanced through this artificial "beaching" practice, and run-off is very common.  Mangroves provide natural filtration, habitat, and prevent erosion into the surrounding [[marine environment]].  This biological lab seeks to encompass all of these sustainable practices in order to support wildlife in its natural system of order.

The '''World Values Survey''' ('''WVS'''), a global [[research project]], explores people's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and [[belief]]s, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have. Since 1981 a worldwide network of [[social scientists]] have conducted representative national [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as part of WVS in almost 100 countries.

The WVS measures, monitors and analyzes: support for [[democracy]], tolerance of foreigners and [[ethnic minorities]], support for [[gender equality]], the role of [[religion]] and changing levels of [[religiosity]], the impact of [[globalization]], attitudes toward the [[Natural environment| environment]], [[Labour economics |work]], [[family]], [[politics]], national identity, [[culture]], [[multiculturalism |diversity]],  insecurity,  and [[subjective well-being]].

The findings provide information for policy makers seeking to build [[civil society]] and democratic institutions in [[developing countries]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} The work is also frequently used by governments around the world, scholars, students, journalists and international organizations and institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the United Nations ([[United Nations Development Programme | UNDP]] and [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme | UN-Habitat]]). Data from the World Values Survey have (for example) been used{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to better understand the motivations behind events such as the [[Arab Spring]], the [[2005 French civil unrest]], the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Yugoslav wars]] and political upheaval in the 1990s. {{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

[[Romano Prodi]], former Prime Minister of Italy and the tenth President of the [[European Commission]], said about WVS work:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The growing globalization of the world makes it increasingly important to understand ... diversity.  People with varying beliefs and values can live together and work together productively, but for this to happen it is crucial to understand and appreciate their distinctive [[worldview]]s.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = xiii}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insights==
The WVS has over the years demonstrated that people's [[beliefs]] play a key role in [[economic development]], the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of [[gender equality]], and the extent to which societies have effective [[government]].

Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: 
# '''Traditional values''' versus '''Secular-rational values''' and 
# '''Survival values''' versus '''Self-expression values'''.
The global cultural map (below) shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self–expression values.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Traditional values'' emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide.  These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Secular-rational values'' have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Survival values'' place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively [[ethnocentric]] outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Self-expression values'' give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

====Culture variations====
A somewhat simplified analysis is that following an increase in [[standards of living]], and a transit from development country via [[industrialization]] to  [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Society#Knowledge society|knowledge society]], a country tends to move diagonally in the direction from lower-left corner (poor) to upper-right corner (rich), indicating a transit in both dimensions.

However, the attitudes among the population are also highly correlated with the philosophical, political and religious ideas that have been dominating in the country. Secular-rational values and [[materialism]] were formulated by philosophers and the [[left-wing politics]] side in the [[French revolution]], and can consequently be observed especially in countries with a long history of social democratic or socialistic policy, and in  countries where a large portion of the population have studied philosophy and science at universities.  Survival values are characteristic for eastern-world countries and self-expression values for western-world countries. In a liberal [[post-industrial economy]], an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival and freedom of thought for granted, resulting in that self-expression is highly valued.

====Examples====
* Societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values: Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh.
* Societies with high scores in Traditional and Self-expression values: the U.S., most of Latin America, Ireland.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Survival values: Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Estonia.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values: Japan, [[Nordic countries]], Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France.

===Gender values===
Findings from the WVS indicate that support for [[gender equality]] is not just a consequence of [[democratization]]. It is part of a broader cultural change that is transforming [[Industrialisation|industrialized societies]] with mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. Although a majority of the world's population still believes that men make better political leaders than women, this view is fading in advanced industrialized societies, and also among young people in less prosperous countries.{{Sfn | Alesina | Giuliano | Nunn | 2010}}

===Religion===
The data from the World Values Survey cover several important aspects of people's religious orientation.  One of them tracks how involved people are in religious services and how much importance they attach to their religious beliefs.  In the data from 2000, 98% of the public in [[Indonesia]] said that religion was very important in their lives while in [[China]] only three percent considered religion very important.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = 2}}  Another aspect concerns people's attitudes towards the relation between religion and politics and whether they approve of religious spokesmen who try to influence government decisions and people's voting preferences.

In a [[factor analysis]] of the latest wave (6) of World Values Survey data, [[Arno Tausch]] ([[Corvinus University Budapest]]) found that family values in the tradition of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] and religious values in the research tradition of [[Robert Barro]] can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of [[religiosity]]. Tausch based his results on a [[factor analysis]] with [[promax]] rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, [[Judaism]] and also [[Protestantism]] emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A. (2015) Towards new maps of global human values, based on World Values Survey (6) data. [[Corvinus University Budapest]] https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/63349.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happiness and life satisfaction===
The WVS has shown that from 1981 to 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which long-term data are available.&lt;ref name=wvs-old2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |title=Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? |publisher=WVS |author=WVSA |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111440/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and rising social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, which supports the [[human development theory]].&lt;ref name=wvs-old2/&gt;

===Findings===
Some of the survey's basic findings are:
# Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “''traditional vs. secular-rational values''” and a second dimension of “''survival vs. self-expression values''.”{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the second dimension, survival values involve a priority of security over liberty, non-acceptance of homosexuality, abstinence from political action, distrust in outsiders and a weak sense of happiness. Self-expression values imply the opposite on all these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# Following the ‘revised theory of modernization,’ values change in predictable ways with certain aspects of modernity. People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their ''sense of existential security'' increases (or backwards from secular-rational values to traditional values as their sense of existential security decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in existential security occurs with the ''transition from agrarian to industrial societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from traditional towards secular-rational values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their ''sense of individual agency'' increases (or backwards from self-expression values to survival as the sense of individual agency decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in individual agency occurs with the ''transition from industrial to knowledge societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from survival to self-expression values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The value differences between societies around the world show a pronounced ''culture zone pattern''. The strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found in the Islamic societies of the Middle East. By contrast, the strongest emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values is found in the Protestant societies of Northern Europe.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# These culture zone differences reflect different ''historical pathways'' of how entire groups of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people's different senses of existential security and individual agency, which in turn account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Values also differ within societies along such cleavage lines as gender, generation, ethnicity, religious denomination, education, income and so forth.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# Generally speaking, groups whose living conditions provide people with a stronger sense of existential security and individual agency nurture a stronger emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# However, the ''within''-societal differences in people's values are dwarfed by a factor five to ten by the ''between''-societal differences. On a global scale, basic living conditions differ still much more between than within societies, and so do the experiences of existential security and individual agency that shape people's values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# A specific subset of self-expression values—''[[emancipation|emancipative]] values''—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal [[autonomy]] and the voice of the people.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values constitute the key cultural component of a broader process of ''human empowerment''. Once set in motion, this process empowers people to exercise freedoms in their course of actions.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# If set in motion, human empowerment advances on three levels. On the socio-economic level, human empowerment advances as growing ''action resources'' increase people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. On the socio-cultural level, human empowerment advances as rising ''emancipative values'' increase people's aspirations to exercise freedoms.  On the legal-institutional level, human empowerment advances as widened ''democratic rights'' increase people's entitlements to exercise freedoms.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Human empowerment is an ''entity of empowering capabilities, aspirations, and entitlements''. As an entity, human empowerment tends to advance in virtuous spirals or to recede in vicious spirals on each of its three levels.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2008 | pp = 126–40}}
# As the cultural component of human empowerment, emancipative values are highly consequential in manifold ways. For one, emancipative values establish a ''civic form of modern individualism'' that favours out-group trust and cosmopolitan orientations towards others.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–23}}
# Emancipative values encourage ''nonviolent protest'', even against the risk of repression. Thus, emancipative values provide [[social capital]] that activates societies, makes publics more self-expressive, and vitalizes civil society. Emancipative values advance entire societies’ civic agency.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Deutsch | 2005 | p = 121–46}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are democratic, they help to ''prevent movements away from democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are undemocratic, they help to trigger ''movements towards democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values exert these effects because they encourage mass actions that put power holders under pressures to sustain, substantiate or establish democracy, depending on what the current challenge for democracy is.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Objective factors that have been found to favour democracy (including economic prosperity, income equality, ethnic homogeneity, world market integration, global media exposure, closeness to democratic neighbours, a Protestant heritage, social capital and so forth) exert an influence on democracy mostly insofar as these factors favour emancipative values.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values do not strengthen people's desire for democracy, for the desire for democracy is universal at this point in history. But emancipative values do change the ''nature of the desire for democracy''. And they do so in a double way.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# For one, emancipative values make people's understanding of democracy more liberal: people with stronger emancipative values emphasize the empowering features of democracy rather than bread-and-butter and law-and-order issues.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Next, emancipative values make people assess the level of their country's democracy more critical: people with stronger emancipative values rather underrate than overrate their country's democratic performance.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Together, then, emancipative values generate a ''critical-liberal desire for democracy''. The critical-liberal desire for democracy is a formidable force of democratic reforms.  And, it is the best available predictor of a country's effective level of democracy and of other indicators of good governance. Neither democratic traditions nor cognitive mobilization account for the strong positive impact of emancipative values on the critical-liberal desire for democracy.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Emancipative values constitute the single most important factor in advancing the [[empowerment]] of women. Economic, religious, and institutional factors that have been found to advance women's empowerment, do so for the most part because they nurture emancipative values.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values change people's life strategy from an emphasis on securing a decent subsistence level to enhancing human agency. As the shift from subsistence to agency affects entire societies, the overall level of [[subjective well-being]] rises.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# The emancipative consequences of the human empowerment process are not a culture-specific peculiarity of the ‘West.’ The same empowerment processes that advance emancipative values and a critical-liberal desire for democracy in the ‘West,’ do the same in the ‘East’ and in other culture zones.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2011 | pp = 1–31}}
# The social dominance of Islam and individual identification as Muslim both weaken emancipative values. But among young Muslims with high education, and especially among young Muslim women with high education, the Muslim/Non-Muslim gap over emancipative values closes.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2011}}

==History==
The World Values Surveys were designed to test the hypothesis that economic and technological changes are transforming the basic values and motivations of the publics of industrialized societies. The surveys build on the [[European Values Study]] (EVS) first carried out in 1981. The EVS was conducted under the aegis of [[Jan Kerkhofs]] and [[Ruud de Moor]] and continues to be based in the [[Netherlands]] at the [[Tilburg University]]. The 1981 study was largely limited to developed societies, but interest in this project spread so widely that surveys were carried out in more than twenty countries, located on all six inhabited continents. [[Ronald Inglehart]] of the [[University of Michigan]] played a leading role in extending these surveys to be carried out in countries around the world. Today the network includes hundreds of social scientist from more than 100 countries.

Findings from the first wave of surveys pointed to the conclusion that intergenerational changes were taking place in basic values relating to politics, economic life, religion, gender roles, family norms and sexual norms. The values of younger generations differed consistently from those prevailing among older generations, particularly in societies that had experienced rapid economic growth. To examine whether changes were actually taking place in these values and to analyze the underlying causes, a second wave of WVS surveys was carried out in 1990–91. Because these changes seem to be linked with economic and technological development, it was important to include societies across the entire range of development, from low income societies to rich societies.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

A third wave of surveys was carried out in 1995–97, this time in 55 societies and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys was carried out in 1999–2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave was carried out in 2005–07 and a sixth wave was carried out during 2011–12.&lt;ref name=wvs51&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |title=Building A Worldwide Network Of Social Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409204339/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |archivedate=April 9, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the European origin of the project, the early waves of the WVS were [[eurocentric]] in emphasis, with little representation in Africa and South-East Asia. To expand, the WVS adopted a decentralised structure, in which social scientists from countries throughout the world participated in the design, execution and analysis of the data, and in publication of findings. In return for providing the data from a survey in their own society, each group obtained immediate access to the data from all participating societies enabling them to analyse social change in a broader perspective.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

The WVS network has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and secondary users have produced several thousand additional publications.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt; The database of the WVS has been published on the internet with free access.

The official archive of the World Values Survey is located in [ASEP/JDS] [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==Methodology==
The World Values Survey uses the [[sample survey]] as its mode of data collection, a systematic and standardized approach to collect information through interviewing representative national samples of individuals. The basic stages of a sample survey are Questionnaire design; [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]]; [[Data collection]] and [[Analysis]].

===Questionnaire design===
For each wave, suggestions for questions are solicited by social scientists from all over the world and a final master [[questionnaire]] is developed in English. Since the start in 1981 each successive wave has covered a broader range of societies than the previous one. Analysis of the data from each wave has indicated that certain questions tapped interesting and important concepts while others were of little value. This has led to the more useful questions or themes being replicated in future waves while the less useful ones have been dropped making room for new questions.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 386}}

The questionnaire is translated into the various national languages and in many cases independently translated back to English to check the accuracy of the translation. In most countries, the translated questionnaire is pre-tested to help identify questions for which the translation is problematic. In some cases certain problematic questions are omitted from the national questionnaire.

===Sampling===
Samples are drawn from the entire population of 18 years and older. The minimum sample is 1000. In most countries, no upper age limit is imposed and some form of stratified random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is used to obtain representative national samples. In the first stages, a random selection of sampling points is made based on the given society statistical regions, districts, census units, election sections, [[electoral registers]] or [[polling place]] and central population registers. In most countries the population size and/or degree of [[urbanization]] of these Primary Sampling Units are taken into account. In some countries, individuals are drawn from national registers.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 390}}

===Data collection and field work===
Following the sampling, each country is left with a representative national sample of its public. These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the Executive Committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires. The survey is carried out by professional organizations using face-to-face [[interviews]] or phone interviews for remote areas. Each country has a Principal Investigator (social scientists working in academic institutions) who is responsible for conducting the survey in accordance with the fixed rules and procedures.  During the field work, the agency has to report in writing according to a specific check-list.  Internal consistency checks are made between the sampling design and the outcome and rigorous data cleaning procedures are followed at the WVS data archive. No country is included in a wave before full documentation has been delivered. This means a data set with the completed methodological questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/survey_2005 | title = World values survey | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a report of country-specific information (for example important political events during the fieldwork, problems particular to the country). Once all the surveys are completed, the Principal Investigator has access to all surveys and data.

===Analysis===
The World Values Survey group works with leading social scientists, recruited from each society studied. They represent a wide range of cultures and perspectives which makes it possible to draw on the insights of well-informed insiders in interpreting the findings. It also helps disseminate social science techniques to new countries.

Each research team, that has contributed to the survey,  analyses the findings according to its hypotheses. Because all researchers obtain data from all of the participating societies, they are also able to compare the values and beliefs of the people of their own society with those from scores of other societies and to test alternative hypotheses. In addition, the participants are invited to international meetings at which they can compare findings and interpretations with other members of the WVS network. The findings are then disseminated through international conferences and joint publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/new_index_publications | title = New index publications | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The World Values Survey data has been downloaded by over 100,000 researchers, journalists, policy-makers and others. The data is available on the WVS website which contains tools developed for online analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/index_surveys | title = Index surveys | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==
The World Values Survey is organised as a network of social scientists coordinated by a central body - the World Values Survey Association. It is established as a non-profit organization seated in Stockholm, Sweden, with a constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52/files/constitution.pdf | title = Constitution | format = PDF | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52 | title = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is guided by an Executive Committee representing all regions of the world. The Committee is also supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee, a Secretariat and an Archive. The WVS Executive Committee provides leadership and strategic planning for the association. It is responsible for the recruitment of new members, the organization of meetings and workshops, data processing and distribution, capacity building and the promotion of publications and dissemination of results. The WVS Executive Committee also raises funds for central functions and assists member groups in their fundraising.

Each national team is responsible for its own expenses and most surveys are financed by local sources. However, central funding has been obtained in cases where local funding is not possible. Presently, the activities of the WVS Secretariat and WVS Executive Committee are funded by the [[Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation]]. Other funding has been obtained from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA), the Volkswagen Foundation, the [[German Science Foundation (DFG)]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]].

The World Values Survey data has been used in a large number of scholarly publications and the findings have been reported in media such as [[BBC News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schifferes|first=Steve|title=The growing anti-Americanism around the World can be explained by the special character of American nationalism.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2970424.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 November 2013|date=2003-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Britain's happiness in decline|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/happiness_formula/4771908.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 November 2013|date=2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria tops happiness survey|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3157570.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 November 2013|date=2003-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Writing material''' refers to the materials that provide the surfaces on which humans use [[writing instruments]] to  inscribe writings. The same materials can also be used for [[symbol]]ic or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] [[drawing]]s. [[Building material]] on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, [[paper]]) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a [[spiral notebook]]). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse.

==Archaeology==
Because drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the [[Rock (geology)|stone]] walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor were [[tally stick]]s used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time ([[days]]). Tally sticks have been found made of [[wood]] and of [[bone]]. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal [[Hide (skin)|hides]] also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, [[birch bark]] is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America.

Four other classes of material were sometimes used for writing: [[clay]], [[wax]], [[cloth]], and [[metal]]. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for [[curse tablets]], as well as personal correspondence.

Cloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. [[Stone tablets]], clay and wooden writing tablets, and [[Wax tablet|wax-covered wooden tablets]] are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing.

Unglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as [[ostraka]], for tax receipts and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for [[ostracism]].

The archaeological record contains either examples of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying.

==Common writing materials of the Middle Ages==
In western civilisations, early use of [[papyrus]] was soon replaced by [[parchment]] made by treating animal hide. A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different texture, quality and hue were widely used for codices, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of [[paper]].

In eastern civilisations such as [[India]], the principal writing media were [[birch bark]] or ''bhurjapatra'' (Sanskrit) and [[palm leaf manuscript|dried palm leaves]]. The use of paper began only after the 10th century. However birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations and other cultural uses.

In China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, [[bamboo and wooden slips]], until the 2nd century when [[paper]] was invented.

==History==
Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of [[papyrus]] in Egypt. [[Parchment]], using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of [[wood-pulp paper]], the cost of writing material began a steady decline.

==Printing==
The dramatic increase in demand foray paper associated with the [[printing press]] stimulated dramatic cost reduction efforts. Specialized materials developed for printing have also been made available for writing. The invention of the [[typewriter]] was a major step, making possible reliable production of legible written materials by organizations and individual writers.

==Electronic media==
Electronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to separate the medium for writing from the medium for reading.
