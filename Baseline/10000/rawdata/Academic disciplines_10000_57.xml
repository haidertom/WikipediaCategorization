A '''beetle bank''', in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]], is a form of [[biological pest control]].  It is a strip planted with [[Poaceae|grass]]es ([[bunch grass]]es) and/or [[perennial plant]]s, within a crop field or a garden, that fosters and provides [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[beneficial insect]]s, birds, and other fauna that prey on pests.

== Usage ==
Beetle banks are typically made up from plants such as [[sunflower]]s, ''[[Vicia faba]]'', ''[[Centaurea cyanus]]'', [[coriander]], [[borage]], ''[[Muhlenbergia]]'', ''[[Stipa]]'', and [[buckwheat]]s (''[[Eriogonum]] spp.''). Beetle banks are used to reduce or replace the use of [[insecticide]]s,&lt;ref name="connell-farmer"&gt;{{cite news |title= Connell organic farmer using 'beetle banks' |author= Kevin McCullen |url= http://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/connell-organic-farmer-using-beetle-banks/ |newspaper= Tri-City Herald |date= 14 June 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also serve as habitat for birds and beneficial rodents. For example, insects such as ''[[Chrysoperla carnea]]'' and the [[Ichneumon fly]] can prey on pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Felix Wäckers, Paul van Rijn and Jan Bruin | publisher=Cambridge University Press, UK, 2005 | year=2005 | title=Plant-Provided Food for Carnivorous Insects - a protective mutualism and its applications | ISBN =978-0-521-81941-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The concept was developed by the [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]].

Other important benefits can be providing habitat for [[pollinator]]s and [[endangered species]]. If using local native plants, [[endemism|endemic]] and indigenous flora and fauna [[restoration ecology]] is supported.

== History of the term ==
According to a March 2005 draft entry for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term first came into use in the early 1990s, with published examples including the August 22, 1992 issue of the ''[[New Scientist]]'' and an October 12, 1994 reference in ''[[The Guardian]]'' society section:
:‘Beetle banks’, a recent initiative by the [[Game Conservancy Trust]], would also help encourage ground-nesting birds while creating cover for [[aphid]]-eating bugs with more pay-off in savings on aphicides.

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

==[[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333)==
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seshin]] (Vasubandhu), Wood, 186cm height, CE1208,The Northern Octagonal Hall of Kofukuji Temple, by [[Unkei]]]]

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 218.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tōdai-ji restoration project lasted several generations, from roughly 1180 to 1212,&lt;ref name=munsterberg&gt;Munsterberg, Huge. ''The Arts of Japan: An Illustrated History''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

[[File:Sesshu - Haboku-Sansui.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Nihongo|''Splashed-ink Landscape''|破墨山水|''[[Haboku sansui]]''}}, [[Sesshū]], 1495, ink on silk, 148.6 × 32.7 cm]]

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

[[File:Hyônen zu by Josetsu.jpg|thumb|170px|Hyōnen-zu (瓢鮎図), ink on paper, 111.5 × 75.8 cm, Myōshin-ji temple, Taizō-in, Kyoto.]]

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

==[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603)==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - left hand screen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku". Occasional Papers No. 11(1969): 3–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

'''Chalcography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] chalcos, copper and graphia, to write), are engravings on [[copper]] plates used for printmaking and for illustrations in the production of books. The ''[[Monte dei Santi di Dio]]'' by [[Antonio Bettini]] is the most ancient book bearing chalcographies, printed in [[Florence]] on September 10, 1477 from [[Nicolo di Lorenzo Tedesco]]. Its primacy is contested by [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Cosmographia]]'', printed in [[Bologna]] on June 23, 1477 from [[Domenico de' Lapi]], a [[Latin]] translation from [[Jacopo d'Angelo]], containing geographical charts and maps by [[Taddeo Crivelli]], engraved in copper plates.

'''Christoph Cremer''' (born in [[Freiburg]] im Breisgau, [[Germany]]) is a German [[physicist]] and [[professor]] at the [[Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg]], honorary professor at the [[University of Mainz]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imb-mainz.de/fileadmin/imb/news/Press_Release_Cremer_HonProfJGU.pdf] Honorary Professorship for IMB’s Christoph Cremer&lt;/ref&gt; and group leader at the [[Institute of Molecular Biology]] (IMB) a newly established research centre on the campus of the Johannes Gutenberg University of [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], who has successfully overcome the conventional limit of resolution that applies to light based investigations (the [[Abbe limit]]) by a range of different methods (1971/1978 development of the concept of 4Pi-microscopy; 1996 localization [[microscopy]] SPDM; 1997 spatially structured illumination SMI). In September 2014 he founded the NPO LuciaOptics to support the use of [[Super-resolution microscopy]] in the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[biomedicine]], [[microbiology]], [[virology]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]] and [[diagnosis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.org] Research Center Microscopy LuciaOptics&lt;/ref&gt;

His actual microscope Vertico-SMI is the world’s fastest nano light microscope that allows large scale investigation of supramolecular complexes including living cell conditions. It allows 3 D imaging of biological preparations marked with conventional fluorescent dyes and reaches a resolution of 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D.

This nanoscope has therefore the potential to add substantially to the current revolution in optical imaging which will affect the entire molecular biology, medical and pharmaceutical research. The technology allows the development of new strategies for the prevention, the lowering of risk and therapeutic treatment of diseases.

== Biography ==
Following a few semesters studying [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at [[Freiburg University]] and [[Munich University]], Cremer studied [[physics]] in [[Munich]] (with financial support from the [[Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes]]) and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in [[genetics]] and [[biophysics]] in Freiburg. This was followed by post-doctoral studies at the Institute for Human Genetics at Freiburg University, several years in the United States at the [[University of California]], and his "[[Habilitation]]" in general human genetics and experimental cytogenetics at Freiburg University. Since 1983, he is teaching as a professor (chair since 2004) for "applied optics and information processing" at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at the University of Heidelberg. In addition, he is a member of the [[Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing]] of the Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, as well as of the University’s "Bioquant" Center. Cremer is a participant in three current "Projects of Excellence" of the University of Heidelberg (2007–2012), and is also a partner in the Biotechnology Cluster for cell-based and molecular medicine, one of five clusters selected in 2008 as German [[BMBF]] Clusters of Excellence. Elected as Second Speaker of the Senate of the University of Heidelberg (since 2006), Cremer is also involved in university governance and politics. In his function as adjunct professor at the [[University of Maine]] and as member of the [[Jackson Laboratory]] ([[Bar Harbor, Maine]]), where he undertakes research for several weeks each year during the semester breaks, he is involved in the establishment of the biophysics center (Institute for Molecular Biophysics), which is linked with the University of Heidelberg through a "Global Network" collaboration.

Cremer is married to [[architect]] and artist Letizia Mancino-Cremer.

== Fundamental developments ==

=== Developing the concept of 4Pi microscopy ===
Cremer was involved early in the further development of [[laser]] based [[light microscopy]] approaches. First ideas had their origin in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother [[Thomas Cremer]], now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed the development of a [[hologram]]-based laser scanning 4Pi [[microscope]]. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, it should be possible to achieve an improved [[optical resolution]] beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200&amp;nbsp;nm lateral, 600&amp;nbsp;nm axial.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"&gt;C. Cremer and T. Cremer (1978): Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field ''Microscopica Acta'' VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

In ''European Journal of Histochemistry'', Vol. 50, pp. 223-272&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by [[Stefan Hell]] (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope [[objective lenses]] of high numeric aperture opposing each other.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hell, S. Lindek, C. Cremer, E. H. K. Stelzer (1994): Measurement of the 4pi-confocal point spread function proves 75 nm axial resolution: in ''Applied Physics Letters'' Vol 64, pp. 1335-1337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Hänninen, S. W. Hell, J. Salo, E. Soini, C. Cremer(1995): Two-photon excitation 4Pi confocal microscope - Enhanced axial resolution microscope for biological research: , in ''Applied Physics Letters'', Vol 68, pp. 1698-1700&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the first DNA laser-UV-microirradiation technique for living cells ===
In the early 1970s, the brothers realized a [[Ultraviolet|UV]] laser micro irradiation instrument which for the first time made it possible to irradiate in a controlled manner only a tiny part of a [[living cell]] at the absorption maximum for [[DNA]] (257&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;C. Cremer, C. Zorn und T. Cremer (1974): An ultraviolet Laser microbeam for 257 nm/Eine Laser-UV-Mikrobestrahlungsapparatur für 257 nm: in ''Microscopica Acta'' Vol. 75, No. 4, pp. 331—337&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the conventional UV partial irradiation practiced for over 60 years. In this way, it was possible for the first time to induce alterations in the DNA in a focused manner (i.e. at predetermined places in the [[cell nucleus]] of living cells) without compromising the cells ability to divide and to survive. Specific very small cell regions could be irradiated and thus the dynamics of [[macromolecules]] (DNA) contained there quantitatively estimated. Furthermore, due to the high speed of the process using irradiation times of fractions of a second, it became possible to irradiate even moving [[cell organelles]]. This development provided the basis for important experiments in the area of [[genome]] structure research (establishing the existence of so-called [[chromosome territories]] in living [[mammalian]] cells) and led, a few years later (1979/1980) to a successful collaboration with the biologist [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]], [[Tübingen]]). In this collaboration Cremer used his UV laser micro irradiation equipment to elicit cellular changes in the early [[larval]] stages of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lohs-Schardin, C. Cremer and C. Nüsslein-Volhard (1979): A Fate Map for the Larval Epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster: Localized Cuticle Defects Following Irradiation of the Blastoderm with an Ultraviolet Laser Microbeam: in ''Developmental Biology'' 73, pp. 239-255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Nüsslein-Volhard, M. Lohs-Schardin, K.Sander and C. Cremer(1980): A dorso-ventral shift of embryonic primordia in a new maternal-effect mutant of Drosophila: in ''Nature'' (London), Vol. 283, No. 5746, pp. 474-476&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the confocal laser scanning microscopy for fluorescence ===
On the basis of experience gained in the construction and application of the UV laser micro irradiation instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object by means of a focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt; It is this plan for the construction of a [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with [[fluorescent marker]]s that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and [[biomedical]] laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three-dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned.

=== Development of the super resolution microscopy methods ===

The goal of microscopy is in many cases to determine the size of individual, small objects. Conventional fluorescence microscopy can only establish sizes to around the conventional [[optical resolution]] limit of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;nm (lateral). More than 20 years after submitting the 4 pi patent application,&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cremer C, Cremer T (1971) &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; Punkthologramme: Physikalische Grundlagen und mögliche Anwendungen. Enclosure to Patent application DE 2116521 "Verfahren zur Darstellung bzw. Modifikation von Objekt-Details, deren Abmessungen außerhalb der sichtbaren Wellenlängen liegen" (Procedure for the imaging and modification of object details with dimensions beyond the visible wavelengths). Filed 5 April 1971; publication date 12 October 1972.Deutsches Patentamt, Berlin. http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000002116521A&lt;/ref&gt; Christoph Cremer returned to the problem of the diffraction limit. 
With the [[Vertico SMI]] microscope he could realize his various super resolution techniques including SMI,SPDM, SPDMphymod and LIMON. These methods are mainly used for biomedical applications &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.com/press-publications/papers-biomedical-applications/ Biomedical applications for Super Resolution Microscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spatially Modulated Illumination SMI====
Around 1995, he commenced with the development of a light microscopic process, which achieved a substantially improved size resolution of cellular [[nanostructure]]s stained with a fluorescent marker. This time he employed the principle of wide field microscopy combined with structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI)&lt;ref&gt;R. Heintzmann, C. Cremer (1999) Lateral modulated excitation microscopy: ''Improvement of resolution by using a diffraction grating''. Proc. SPIE 3568: 185-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 7,342,717, filed 10 July 1997: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernhard Schneider ''Wave field microscope with detection point spread function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaddeleyCremerBirk2007"&gt;D.

Birk (2007): Nano-structure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy: in ''Nature Protocols'', Vol 2, pp. 2640–2646&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a size resolution of 30 – 40&amp;nbsp;nm (approximately 1/16 – 1/13 of the wavelength used) is being achieved. In addition, this technology is no longer subjected to the speed limitations of the focusing microscopy so that it becomes possible to undertake 3D analyses of whole cells within short observation times (at the moment around a few seconds).

==== Localization Microscopy SPDM ====
Also around 1995, Cremer developed and realized new fluorescence based wide field microscopy approaches which had as their goal the improvement of the effective optical resolution (in terms of the smallest detectable distance between two localized objects) down to a fraction of the conventional resolution (spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy, SPDM; Disambiguation SPDM: S = Spectral, P = Precision, D = Distance, M = Microscopy).&lt;ref&gt;J.

SPIE 2926: 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6,424,421, filed 23 December 1996: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernd Rinke ''Method and devices for measuring distances between object structures''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Heintzmann, H. Münch, C. Cremer (1997) ''High-precision measurements in epifluorescent microscopy - simulation and experiment''. Cell Vision 4: 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Localization Microscopy SPDMphymod ====
With this method, it is possible to use conventional, well established and inexpensive fluorescent dyes, standard like GFP, RFP, YFP, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 647, Cy2, Cy3, Atto 488 and fluorescein.

==== 3D Light microscopical nanosizing (LIMON) microscopy ====
Combining SPDM and SMI, known as LIMON microscopy.&lt;ref name="ReymannCremerMay2008"/&gt; Christoph Cremer can currently achieve a resolution of approx. 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D in wide field images of whole living cells.&lt;ref&gt;P.

'''Christoph Sutter''' (born 20 March 1973)&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] carbon expert and [[entrepreneur]]. Christoph attended the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] where he studied for an MSc in Environmental Science (1993–1999) and a Master of Didactics on Environmental Science. He also concluded his PhD on the Topic "Sustainability Assessment of CDM Projects under the Kyoto Protocol" there. His thesis was awarded the ETH medal for the best PhD thesis in 2003.&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; He completed his education with a McKinsey mini MBA in Toronto in Summer 2005.

After working for the consultancy Ernst Basler &amp; Partner in Zurich during his studies he was part of setting up the [[myclimate]] foundation based on his PhD results. Myclimate is an offset provider for the voluntary offsetting market, focused on [[CDM Gold Standard]] Certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214170120/http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this activity, Christoph was called to work for the [[UNFCCC]] Methodology Panel in 2005 where he worked for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzz.ch/vermittler_zwischen_umwelt_und_wirtschaft-1.812553|title=Vermittler zwischen Umwelt und Wirtschaft - NZZ|date=21 August 2008|publisher=|via=NZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unsatisfied with the exclusive focus on voluntary offsetting, he later founded the company [http://www.southpolecarbon.com] [[South Pole Carbon]] with his former colleagues Thomas Camerata and [[Renat Heuberger]].

He was Co-CEO of South Pole Carbon Asset Management Ltd from 2006 until 2012, but continue to act as non-executive chairman and shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203030354/http://www.southpolecarbon.com:80/media/archive_news|title=Archive – News - South Pole Carbon|date=3 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cigarette smokers problem''' is a [[concurrent computing|concurrency]] problem in [[computer science]], originally described in 1971 by [[Suhas Patil]].

==Problem description==
Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of ''one'' of the three ingredients &amp;mdash; one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches.

There is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily ([[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministically]]) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table. This process continues forever.

Three [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]]s are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and smokers decrement the semaphore when removing items. Also, each smoker has an associated semaphore that they use to signal to the agent that they are done smoking; the agent has a process that waits on each smoker's semaphore to let it know that it can place the new items on the table.

A simple [[pseudocode]] implementation of the smoker who has the supply of tobacco might look like the following:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def tobacco_smoker():
    repeat:
        paper.wait()
        matches.wait()
        smoke()
        tobacco_smoker_done.signal()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

However, this can lead to deadlock; if the agent places paper and tobacco on the table, the smoker with tobacco may remove the paper, leaving the smoker with matches unable to make their cigarette. The problem is to define additional processes and semaphores that prevent deadlock, without modifying the agent.

==Argument==
Patil placed the following constraints on the cigarette smokers problem:

#The agent code is not modifiable.
#The solution is not allowed to use conditional statements.

Patil used a proof in terms of [[Petri net]]s to claim that a solution to the cigarette smokers problem using [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s semaphore primitives is impossible, and to suggest that a more powerful primitive is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Patil |first=Suhas S. | authorlink=Suhas Patil |title= Limitations and Capabilities of Dijkstra's Semaphore Primitives for Coordination among Processes |number=Memo 57 |institution=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Project MAC]], Computation Structures Group |date=February 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[David Parnas]] demonstrated that Patil's proof is inadequate if arrays of semaphore are used, offering a solution that uses helper processes that do arithmetic to signal the appropriate smoker to proceed.&lt;ref name="Parnas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnas |first=David L. |authorlink=David Parnas |title=On a solution to the cigarette smokers' problem (without conditional statements) |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=181–183 |date=March 1975 |doi=10.1145/360680.360709 |url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2992&amp;context=compsci |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Allen B. Downey]], the first restriction makes sense, because if the agent represents an [[operating system]], it would be unreasonable or impossible to modify it every time a new application came along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Downey |first=Allen B. |authorlink=Allen B. Downey |title=The Little Book of Semaphores |url=http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/ |edition=2nd |access-date=29 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Parnas argues that the second restriction is unjustified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The limitations reported by Patil are limitations of his primitives, but they are not limitations on the primitives described by Dijkstra. … It is important, however, that such an investigation [of Dijkstra primitives] not investigate the power of these primitives under artificial restrictions. By artificial we mean restrictions which cannot be justified by practical considerations. In this author's opinion, restrictions prohibiting either conditionals or semaphore arrays are artificial.&lt;ref name="Parnas"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Cloud computing security''' or, more simply, '''cloud security'''  refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of [[cloud computing]]. It is a sub-domain of [[computer security]], [[network security]], and, more broadly, [[information security]].

==Security issues associated with the cloud==

Cloud [[computing]] and storage provides users with capabilities to store and process their data in third-party [[data center]]s.&lt;ref name="cloudid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haghighat | first1 = M. | last2 = Zonouz | first2 = S. | last3 = Abdel-Mottaleb | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = CloudID: Trustworthy Cloud-based and Cross-Enterprise Biometric Identification | doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025 | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | volume = 42 | issue = 21| pages = 7905–7916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations use the cloud in a variety of different service models (with acronyms such as [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], and [[IaaS]]) and deployment models ([[Cloud computing#Private cloud|private]], [[Cloud computing#Public cloud|public]], [[Cloud computing#Hybrid|hybrid]], and [[community cloud|community]]).&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Srinivasan|first=Madhan|title='State-of-the-art cloud computing security taxonomies: a classification of security challenges in the present cloud computing environment|publisher= ACM ICACCI'|year=2012|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2345396.2345474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security concerns associated with cloud computing fall into two broad categories: security issues faced by cloud providers (organizations providing [[Software as a service|software-]], [[Platform as a service|platform-]], or [[Infrastructure as a service|infrastructure-as-a-service]] via the cloud) and security issues faced by their customers (companies or organizations who host applications or store data on the cloud).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://security.sys-con.com/node/1231725|title=Swamp Computing a.k.a. Cloud Computing|publisher=Web Security Journal|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility is shared, however. The provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure and that their clients’ data and applications are protected, while the user must take measures to fortify their application and use strong passwords and authentication measures.

When an organization elects to store data or host applications on the public cloud, it loses its ability to have physical access to the servers hosting its information. As a result, potentially sensitive data is at risk from insider attacks. According to a recent [[Cloud Security Alliance]] report, insider attacks are the sixth biggest threat in cloud computing.&lt;ref name="Top Threats to Cloud Computing v1.0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Threats to Cloud Computing v1.0|url=https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/topthreats/csathreats.v1.0.pdf|publisher=Cloud Security Alliance|accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, cloud service providers must ensure that thorough background checks are conducted for employees who have physical access to the servers in the data center. Additionally, data centers must be frequently monitored for suspicious activity.

In order to conserve resources, cut costs, and maintain efficiency, cloud service providers often store more than one customer's data on the same server. As a result, there is a chance that one user's private data can be viewed by other users (possibly even competitors). To handle such sensitive situations, cloud service providers should ensure proper [[Isolation (database systems)|data isolation]] and logical storage segregation.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"/&gt;

The extensive use of [[virtualization]] in implementing cloud infrastructure brings unique security concerns for customers or tenants of a public cloud service.&lt;ref name="Cloud Virtual Security Winkler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Cloud Computing: Virtual Cloud Security Concerns|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh641415.aspx|publisher=Technet Magazine, Microsoft|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtualization alters the relationship between the OS and underlying hardware – be it computing, storage or even networking. This introduces an additional layer – virtualization – that itself must be properly configured, managed and secured.&lt;ref name="virtualization risks hickey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickey|first=Kathleen|title=Dark Cloud: Study finds security risks in virtualization|url=http://gcn.com/articles/2010/03/18/dark-cloud-security.aspx|publisher=Government Security News|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific concerns include the potential to compromise the virtualization software, or "hypervisor". While these concerns are largely theoretical, they do exist.&lt;ref name="Securing the Cloud Winkler virt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Securing the Cloud: Cloud Computer Security Techniques and Tactics|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Waltham, MA USA|isbn=978-1-59749-592-9 |page=59|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/723529/description#description}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a breach in the administrator workstation with the management software of the virtualization software can cause the whole datacenter to go down or be reconfigured to an attacker's liking.

== Cloud security controls ==

Cloud security architecture is effective only if the correct defensive implementations are in place. An efficient cloud security architecture should recognize the issues that will arise with security management.&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"&gt;Krutz, Ronald L., and Russell Dean Vines. "Cloud Computing Security Architecture." Cloud Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Secure Cloud Computing. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley, 2010. 179-80. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The security management addresses these issues with security controls. These controls are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack. While there are many types of controls behind a cloud security architecture, they can usually be found in one of the following categories:&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"/&gt;

;Deterrent controls
:These controls are intended to reduce attacks on a cloud system. Much like a warning sign on a fence or a property, deterrent controls typically reduce the threat level by informing potential attackers that there will be adverse consequences for them if they proceed.  (Some consider them a subset of preventive controls.)

;Preventive controls
:Preventive controls strengthen the system against incidents, generally by reducing if not actually eliminating vulnerabilities.  Strong authentication of cloud users, for instance, makes it less likely that unauthorized users can access cloud systems, and more likely that cloud users are positively identified.

;Detective controls
:Detective controls are intended to detect and react appropriately to any incidents that occur. In the event of an attack, a detective control will signal the preventative or corrective controls to address the issue.&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"/&gt;  System and network security monitoring, including intrusion detection and prevention arrangements, are typically employed to detect attacks on cloud systems and the supporting communications infrastructure.

;Corrective controls
:Corrective controls reduce the consequences of an incident, normally by limiting the damage. They come into effect during or after an incident.  Restoring system backups in order to rebuild a compromised system is an example of a corrective control.

==Dimensions of cloud security==

It is generally recommended that information security controls be selected and implemented according and in proportion to the risks, typically by assessing the threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. Cloud security concerns can be grouped in various ways; Gartner named seven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/gartner-seven-cloud-computing-security-risks-853|title=Gartner: Seven cloud-computing security risks|publisher=InfoWorld|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Cloud Security Alliance]] identified twelve areas of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-cloud-computing-plus-industry-insights/|title=Top Threats to Cloud Computing Plus: Industry Insights|last=|first=|date=2017-10-20|year=|website=|publisher=Cloud Security Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cloud access security broker]]s (CASBs) are software that sits between cloud users and cloud applications to provide visibility into cloud application usage, data protection and governance to monitor all activity and enforce security policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)?|publisher=CipherCloud|url = https://www.ciphercloud.com/what-is-a-casb|accessdate = 2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and privacy==

;Identity management :Every enterprise will have its own [[identity management system]] to control access to information and computing resources. Cloud providers either integrate the customer’s identity management system into their own infrastructure, using [[Federated identity management|federation]] or [[Single sign-on|SSO]] technology, or a biometric-based identification system,&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt; or provide an identity management system of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/identity-management-in-the-cloud/d/d-id/1140751 |title=Identity Management in the Cloud |publisher=Information Week |date=2013-10-25 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; CloudID,&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt; for instance, provides privacy-preserving cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification. It links the confidential information of the users to their biometrics and stores it in an encrypted fashion. Making use of a searchable encryption technique, biometric identification is performed in encrypted domain to make sure that the cloud provider or potential attackers do not gain access to any sensitive data or even the contents of the individual queries.&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt;

;Physical security :Cloud service providers physically secure the IT [[Computer hardware|hardware]] (servers, routers, cables etc.) against unauthorized access, interference, theft, fires, floods etc. and ensure that essential supplies (such as electricity) are sufficiently robust to minimize the possibility of disruption.  This is normally achieved by serving cloud applications from 'world-class' (i.e. professionally specified, designed, constructed, managed, monitored and maintained) data centers.

;Personnel security :Various information security concerns relating to the IT and other professionals associated with cloud services are typically handled through pre-, para- and post-employment activities such as security screening potential recruits, security awareness and training programs, proactive.
;Privacy :Providers ensure that all critical data (credit card numbers, for example) are [[data masking|masked]] or encrypted and that only authorized users have access to data in its entirety. Moreover, digital identities and credentials must be protected as should any data that the provider collects or produces about customer activity in the cloud.

==== Cloud Vulnerability and Penetration Testing ====
Scanning could from outside and inside using free or commercial products is very important because without a hardened environment your service is considered as a soft target. Virtual servers should be hardened like a physical server against [[Data leakage prevention|data leakage]], malware, and exploited vulnerabilities. "Data loss or leakage represents 24.6% and cloud related malware 3.4% of threats causing cloud outages”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thangasamy|first=Veeraiyah|date=2017|title=Journal of Applied Technology and Innovation|url=|journal=http://www.apu.edu.my/ejournals/jati/journal/JATI-VOLUME_1-ISSUE_2-2017.pdf|volume=1|pages=97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanning and penetration testing from inside or outside the cloud require to be authorized by the cloud provider. Since the cloud is a shared environment with other tenants following penetration testing rules of engagement step-by-step is a mandatory requirement. Violation of [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement acceptable use policy] which can lead to termination of the service.

== Data security ==
A number of security threats are associated with cloud data services: not only traditional security threats, such as network eavesdropping, illegal invasion, and denial of service attacks, but also specific cloud computing threats, such as side channel attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services. The following security requirements limit the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jun Tang|first=Yong Cui|date=2016|title=Ensuring Security and Privacy Preservation for Cloud Data Services|url=http://www.4over6.edu.cn/cuiyong/lunwen/Ensuring%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20Preservation%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20Services.pdf|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|doi=10.1145/2906153|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confidentiality ===
Data confidentiality is the property that data contents are not made available or disclosed to illegal users. Outsourced data is stored in a cloud and out of the owners' direct control. Only authorized users can access the sensitive data while others, including CSPs, should not gain any information of the data. Meanwhile, data owners expect to fully utilize cloud data services, e.g., data search, data computation, and data sharing, without the leakage of the data contents to CSPs or other adversaries.

=== Access controllability ===
Access controllability means that a data owner can perform the selective restriction of access to her or his data outsourced to cloud. Legal users can be authorized by the owner to access the data, while others can not access it without permissions. Further, it is desirable to enforce fine-grained access control to the outsourced data, i.e., different users should be granted different access privileges with regard to different data pieces. The access authorization must be controlled only by the owner in untrusted cloud environments.

=== Integrity ===
Data integrity demands maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data. A data owner always expects that her or his data in a cloud can be stored correctly and trustworthily. It means that the data should not be illegally tampered, improperly modified, deliberately deleted, or maliciously fabricated. If any undesirable operations corrupt or delete the data, the owner should be able to detect the corruption or loss. Further, when a portion of the outsourced data is corrupted or lost, it can still be retrieved by the data users.

== Encryption ==
Some advanced [[encryption]] algorithms which have been applied into cloud computing increase the protection of privacy. In a practice called [[crypto-shredding]], the keys can simply be deleted when there is no more use of the data.

=== Attribute-based encryption (ABE) ===
[[Attribute-based encryption]] is a type of [[public-key encryption]] in which the [[secret key]] of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes (e.g. the country in which he lives, or the kind of subscription he has). In such a system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext.

==== Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) ====

In the CP-ABE, the encryptor controls access strategy. The main research work of CP-ABE is focused on the design of the access structure.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |url= https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bwaters/publications/papers/cp-abe.pdf|title= Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption|last1= Bethencourt|first1= John|last2= Sahai|first2= Amit|author-link2= Amit_Sahai|last3= Waters|first3= Brent|book-title= IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2007|pages= 321–334}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) ====

In the KP-ABE, attribute sets are used to describe the encrypted texts and the private keys are associated to specified policy that users will have.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) ===
Fully [[homomorphic encryption]] allows computations on encrypted data, and also allows computing sum and product for the encrypted data without decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Searchable encryption (SE) ===
Searchable encryption is a cryptographic system which offer secure search functions over encrypted data.
&lt;ref name="Wang et al. 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Qian|

SE schemes can be classified into two categories: SE based on secret-key (or symmetric-key) cryptography,
and SE based on public-key cryptography.
In order to improve search efficiency, symmetric-key SE generally builds keyword indexes to answer user queries.

==Compliance==

Numerous laws and regulations pertain to the storage and use of data.  In the US these include privacy or data protection laws, [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], the [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), and [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998]], among others.

Similar laws may apply in different legal jurisdictions and may differ quite markedly from those enforced in the US.  Cloud service users may often need to be aware of the legal and regulatory differences between the jurisdictions.  For example, data stored by a cloud service provider may be located in, say, Singapore and mirrored in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyslegaledge.com/2014/08/29/managing-legal-risks-arising-from-cloud-computing/|title=Managing legal risks arising from cloud computing  |publisher=DLA Piper |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these regulations mandate particular controls (such as strong access controls and audit trails) and require regular reporting. Cloud customers must ensure that their cloud providers adequately fulfil such requirements as appropriate, enabling them to comply with their obligations since, to a large extent, they remain accountable.

;Business continuity and data recovery
:Cloud providers have [[business continuity planning|business continuity]] and [[data recovery]] plans in place to ensure that service can be maintained in case of a disaster or an emergency and that any data loss will be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/benefits-cloud-based-recovery.aspx|title=It’s Time to Explore the Benefits of Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery |publisher=Dell.com |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans may be shared with and reviewed by their customers, ideally dovetailing with the customers' own continuity arrangements. Joint continuity exercises may be appropriate, simulating a major Internet or electricity supply failure for instance.

;Log and audit trail
:In addition to producing logs and [[audit trail]]s, cloud providers work with their customers to ensure that these logs and audit trails are properly secured, maintained for as long as the customer requires, and are accessible for the purposes of forensic investigation (e.g., [[eDiscovery]]).

;Unique compliance requirements
:In addition to the requirements to which customers are subject, the data centers used by cloud providers may also be subject to compliance requirements. Using a cloud service provider (CSP) can lead to additional security concerns around data jurisdiction since customer or tenant data may not remain on the same system, or in the same data center or even within the same provider's cloud.&lt;ref name="Securing the Cloud Winkler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Securing the Cloud: Cloud Computer Security Techniques and Tactics|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Waltham, MA USA|isbn=978-1-59749-592-9|pages=65, 68, 72, 81, 218–219, 231, 240|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/723529/description#description}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The European Union’s [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] regulation has introduced new compliance requirements for customer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.safeswisscloud.ch/en/blog/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-how-does-new-european-data-protection-standard-impact|title=General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): How does the new European data-protection standard impact a company's cloud strategy? {{!}} Safe Swiss Cloud|website=safeswisscloud.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and contractual issues==

Aside from the security and compliance issues enumerated above, cloud providers and their customers will negotiate terms around liability (stipulating how incidents involving data loss or compromise will be resolved, for example), [[intellectual property]], and end-of-service (when data and applications are ultimately returned to the customer). In addition, there are considerations for acquiring data from the cloud that may be involved in litigation.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Richard|title='The emergence of cloud storage and the need for a new digital forensic process model|publisher=Murdoch University|year=2013|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/19431/1/emergence_of_cloud_storage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are discussed in [[service-level agreement]]s (SLA).

===Public records===

Legal issues may also include [[Records management|records-keeping]] requirements in the [[public sector]], where many agencies are required by law to retain and make available [[Records management#Managing electronic records|electronic records]] in a specific fashion. This may be determined by legislation, or law may require agencies to conform to the rules and practices set by a records-keeping agency. Public agencies using cloud computing and storage must take these concerns into account.

The '''East–West Center''' ('''EWC'''), or the '''Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West''', is an education and research organization established by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1960 to strengthen relations and understanding among the peoples and nations of [[Asia]], the [[Pacific]], and the [[United States]]. It is headquartered in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].

The East–West Center originated as a [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] faculty initiative with a February 16, 1959, memo from professor [[Murray Turnbull]], then acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, to political science professor Norman Meller, then chairperson of the faculty senate, that proposed the creation of an International College of Cultural Affairs. However, [[University of Hawaii]] President [[Laurence H. Snyder]] stated that budgetary constraints prevented proceeding at the time with the idea.&lt;!--

Two months later, following radio reports of an April 16, 1959 speech in Washington, D.C. by then Sen. [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Texas|TX]]) that proposed the creation of an international university in Hawaii "as a meeting place for the intellectuals of the East and the West," history professor John Stalker and Meller urged President Snyder to respond at once to Johnson's suggestion.&lt;!--

On June 9, 1959, Sen. Johnson introduced a bill in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to establish an educational center in Hawaii to provide for "cultural and technical interchange between East and West," with a companion bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] by [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[John A.

On May 14, 1960, President Eisenhower signed the Mutual Security Act of 1960 which authorized the creation of a Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West (East–West Center) at the University of Hawaii, and on August 31, 1960, signed the Department of State Appropriation Act, 1961, which appropriated $10 million for the Center (including $8.2 million in capital spending for six new buildings), and on September 30, 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signed Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1962, which appropriated an additional $3.3 million for the Center.&lt;!--

On October 25, 1960, the University of Hawaii signed a [[grant-in-aid]] agreement with the State Department to establish and operate the East–West Center, and received its first installment of $1.1 million in federal funding on November 8, 1960.&lt;!--

Four of the six buildings were completed and opened in September 1962: Edmondson Hall (a four-story building containing classrooms and laboratories), Kennedy Theatre (an 800-seat theatre), Hale Kuahine (a four-story women's dormitory for 120 students), and Lincoln Hall (a four-story residence hall for senior scholars and faculty).&lt;!--

In 1977, John A. Burns Hall, located south of Hale Manoa on the {{convert|21|acre|m2|adj=on}} East–West Center campus, was completed. The four-story building for administrative offices was designed by architect John Hara to integrate with the style of the other East–West Center buildings (its windows mimic those of Lincoln Hall). It was built with State of Hawaii funds to compensate the federal government for the University's use of Edmondson Hall, the Kennedy Theatre, and the 4-story wing of Moore Hall, which had been built with federal funds for the East–West Center.&lt;!--

==Structure==
EWC program areas include Education, Research, Seminars, a [[Washington, D.C.]] office (which also houses and administers the United States Asia Pacific Council), an Office of External Affairs and the East–West Center Foundation.

===Research Program===
The Research Program conducts studies on economic development, trade, energy, governance, politics, security, conflict reduction, population, health, and environment. Under the Research umbrella is the Pacific Islands Development Program (the research and training arm and regional secretariat of the [[Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders]] representing 22 Pacific island nations).

===Education Program===
The Education Program offers educational opportunities for students and professional development seminars and workshops for educators from the U.S. and the region. The Student Program is carried out in partnership with the University of Hawaii and other universities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. scholarships are awarded annually in an international competition. Also under the Education Program are the [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] (APLP) (a certificate program for graduate-level students and mid-level professionals)[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/aplp/], AsiaPacificEd and the Asian Studies Development Program (both work with primary, secondary, and college educators to infuse Asian Pacific content in curricula), and Education 2020 (a focus on new approaches to educational challenges in the Asia Pacific Region). Most of education program participants reside in EWC dormitories like [[Hale Manoa Dormitory]].

===East–West Seminars===
East–West Seminars bring professionals from government, civil society, business and the media together for short-term dialogue and exchange programs to share knowledge and address issues of regional and global concern. Included in the Seminars Program are the Media Program (provides journalist with first-hand examination of issues in the region and the U.S.), Senior Policy Seminar (brings together top level foreign affairs and security officials, private sector and civil society leaders to discuss key regional issues), and the Asia Pacific Executive Forum (brings to American cities discussions on topics that affect the economics and business of the region). The East–West Center also organizes various women empowerment programs. It recently organized 2014 Changing Faces Women’s Leadership Seminar at Hawaii which saw the participation of 13 women entrepreneurs from the Asia Pacific Region.

===Office of External Affairs===
The Office of External Affairs (OEA) connects the resources and research of the EWC with the local, national, and international community through educational outreach, public programs, briefings, and media relations. Within the OEA is the News and Information office (provides EWC research findings, opinion pieces, and analysis of issues to journalists and the public), the Arts Program (presents performances and exhibitions illuminating the cultural values and art forms of national and ethnic traditions in the region), and the Alumni Office (works with an international network of professionals from more than 50 countries who have had a past affiliation with the EWC).

===East–West Center Foundation===
The East–West Center Foundation expands and enhances support for the EWC with private resources that support scholarships, research, and seminar initiatives not covered by core Congressional funding.

==Funding==
Approximately half of Center funding comes from the U.S. government, with additional support provided by private agencies, individuals, foundations, corporations, and the governments of the region. In 2005 the EWC received a total of $37 million (including $19.2 million from the U.S. Congress).

On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama requested a reduction in federal funding for the EWC, from $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $12 million for fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref name=wp20110421&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outcome of the 2010 request was a $2 million increase in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  Subsequently in 2011, a request to reduce the budget by 50% (reduction by $10.7 million) was placed as part of the budget proposal.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  The outcome of this request was a $2 million decrease in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;

==Impact==
The impact of the EWC is far-reaching. More than 50,000 people have participated in EWC programs since 1960, including many who currently hold positions of leadership throughout the United States and the Asia Pacific. Alumni include heads of government, cabinet members, university and [[NGO]] presidents, corporate and media leaders, educators and individuals prominent in the arts.

==East–West Center Gallery==
The East–West Center Gallery presents changing exhibits of traditional and contemporary arts of the Pacific region.  The gallery is located on the campus of the University of Hawaii, and is open daily except Saturday.  Cultural performances are also presented.

== Hale Manoa Dormitory ==
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-HaleManoa-wide.JPG|thumb|Hale Manoa Dormitory]]

Hale Manoa is the East–West Center's student [[dormitory]].&lt;ref name="Place Names of Hawaii"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkw4JooFxZAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Hale+Manoa+Dormitory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oW-Aid00G8&amp;sig=LooeaKiMeEVXPcSDs6nf3xxe07I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwksr1qoHKAhVCKGMKHUZFCkU4ChDoAQhHMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%20Manoa%20Dormitory&amp;f=false | title=Place Names of Hawaii - Hale Manoa | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 13-story building, constructed in 1962, was designed by American architect [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]], and is located in the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Hale Manoa Dormitory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/128714/hale-manoa-dormitory-honolulu-hi-usa | title=Hale Manoa Dormitory | publisher=Emporis is a global provider of building information | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dormitory has a housing capacity of more than 400. This is a predominantly [[graduate student]] dormitory and most of the residents are mainly recipients of East West Center scholarships or are affiliated with their programs. Hence here there are [[EWC Graduate Degree Fellows]], [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] participants, [[EWC Affiliates]] and others who are not directly funded by the EWC. A large majority of the residents are international students from the Asia-Pacific region like China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Recently, there has been a move to bring in more students from [[South Asian]] countries.

It was an all-male dormitory, whereas a sister dormitory, [[Hale Kuahine]], situated just next to the [[Imin Center]] and also a [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]] building, housed all the females. Currently, Hale Manoa houses students of both genders.

'''Emotion work''' is understood as the art of trying to change in degree or quality an emotion or feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ferrara | first = Alessandro | author-link = Alessandro Ferrara | contribution = Rousseau's psychology of the self: C Excursus on authenticity | editor-last = Ferrara | editor-first = Alessandro | editor-link = Alessandro Ferrara | title = Modernity and authenticity: a study in the social and ethical thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau | page = 87 | publisher = State University of New York | location = Albany | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780791412367 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotion work may be defined as the management of one's own feelings, or work done in an effort to maintain a relationship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Cook |first1= Alicia |last2= Berger |first2= Peggy |title= Predictors of emotion work and household labor among dual-earner couples |date= April 2000 |website= cyfernet.org |publisher= CYFAR Program, [[University of Minnesota]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501193538/http://www.cyfernet.org/parent/workandfamily/colorado_findings.html |archive-date= 1 May 2009 |url= http://www.cyfernet.org/parent/workandfamily/colorado_findings.html |access-date= 10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is dispute as to whether emotion work is only work done regulating one’s own emotion, or extends to performing the emotional work for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Oliker | first = Stacey J. | contribution = Women friends and marriage work | editor-last = Oliker | editor-first = Stacey J. | title = Best friends and marriage: exchange among women | page = 124 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780520063921 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hochschild==

[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]], who introduced the term in 1979, distinguished emotion work – unpaid emotional work that a person undertakes in private life  – from [[emotional labor]]: emotional work done in a paid work setting.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1979&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 551–575 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | date = November 1979 | jstor = 2778583 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie R. |chapter=Ideology and emotion management: A perspective and path for future research|editor-last=Kemper |editor-first=Theodore D.|title=Research agendas in the sociology of emotions|pages=117&amp;ndash;142|location=Albany, NY|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0269-6|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion work has use value and occurs in situations in which people choose to regulate their emotions for their own non-compensated benefit (e.g., in their interactions with family and friends). By contrast, emotional labor has exchange value because it is traded and performed for a wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callahan|first1=Jamie L.|last2=McCollun|first2=Eric E.|chapter=Obscured variability: The distinction between emotion work and emotional labor|editor-last1=Ashkanasy|editor-first1=Neal M.|editor-last2=Zerbe|editor-first2=Wilfred J.|editor-last3=Haertel|editor-first3=Charmine E.

In a later development, Hochschild distinguished between two broad types of emotion work, and among three techniques of emotion work.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1990&gt;{{citation | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | contribution = Ideology and emotion management: a perspective and path for future research | editor-last = Kemper | editor-first = Theodore D. | title = Research agendas in the sociology of emotions | pages = 117–144 | publisher = [[State University of New York Press]] | location = Albany | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780585092379 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HkHgh2isxHIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=ARLIE+RUSSELL+HOCHSCHILD+emotion+work&amp;ots=U6qWOvm4dv&amp;sig=H5ZImY1DgQowyuIKXtKuHPezri0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; The two broad types involve evocation and suppression of emotion, while the three techniques of emotion work that Hochschild describes are cognitive, bodily and expressive.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1990 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Peterson | first = Gretchen | contribution = Managing emotions | editor-last1 = Turner | editor-first1 = Jonathan H. | editor-last2 = Stets | editor-first2 = Jan E. | editor-link1 = Jonathan H. Turner | title = Handbook of the sociology of emotions | page = 125 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780387307152 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept (if not the term) has been traced back as far as [[Aristotle]]: as Aristotle saw, the problem is not with emotionality, but with the ''appropriateness'' of emotion and its expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = Daniel Goleman | contribution = Aristotle's challenge | editor-last = Goleman | editor-first = Daniel | editor-link = Daniel Goleman | title = Emotional intelligence: why it can matter more than IQ | page = xiv | publisher = Bantam Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780553375060 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Examples of emotion work include showing affection, apologizing after an argument, bringing up problems that need to be addressed in an [[intimate relationship]] or any kind of [[interpersonal relationship]], and making sure the household runs smoothly.

Emotion work also involves the orientation of self/others to accord with accepted [[norm (social)|norm]]s of emotional expression: emotion work is often performed by family members and friends, who put pressure on individuals to conform to emotional norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1= Ruberg | first1= Willemijn | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1= Ruberg | editor-first1= Willemijn | editor-last2= Steenbergh | editor-first2= Kristine | title = Sexed sentiments: interdisciplinary perspectives on gender and emotion | page = 9 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9789042032415 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, then, an individual's ultimate obeisance and/or resistance to aspects of emotion regimes are made visible in their emotion work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ruberg | first = Odette | contribution = Divine providence and resignation: the role of religion in the management of emotions of the Anglo-Irish Countess of Dunraven, Caroline Wydham-Quin (1790-1870) | editor-last1= Ruberg | editor-last2= Steenbergh | title = Sexed sentiments: interdisciplinary perspectives on gender and emotion | page = 75 | year = 2010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural norms often imply that emotion work is reserved for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | contribution = Gendered sexualities | editor-last = Kimmel | editor-first = Michael S. | editor-link = Michael Kimmel | title = The gendered society | pages = 237–238 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780195149753 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly evidence to the effect that the emotional management that women and men do is asymmetric;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Oliker | contribution = Women friends and marriage work | editor-last = Oliker | title = Best friends and marriage: exchange among women | page = 144 | year = 1989 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in general, women come into a marriage groomed for the role of emotional manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Goleman | author-link = Daniel Goleman | contribution = Intimate enemies | title = Emotional intelligence | editor-last = Goleman | editor-link = Daniel Goleman | page = 132 | year = 1995  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The social theorist, Victor Jeleniewski Seidler, argues that women's emotion work is merely another demonstration of [[false consciousness]] under [[patriarchy]], and that emotion work, as a concept, has been adopted, adapted or criticized to such an extent that it is in danger of becoming a "catch-all-cliché".&lt;ref name=Seidler&gt;{{citation | last = Seidler | first = Victor J. | contribution = Masculinity, violence and emotional life | editor-last1 = Williams | editor-first1 = Simon J. | editor-last2 = Bendelow | editor-first2 = Gillian | editor-link1 = Simon Williams (sociologist) | title = Emotions in social life: critical themes and contemporary issues | pages = 209–210 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780203437452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the concept of emotion work has itself been criticized as a wide over-simplification of mental processes such as [[Psychological repression|repression]] and [[denial]] which continually occur in everyday life.&lt;ref name=Seidler /&gt;

==Literary analogues==
[[Rousseau]] in ''[[The New Heloise]]'' suggests that the attempt to master instrumentally one's affective life always results in a weakening and eventually the fragmentation of one's identity, even if the emotion work is performed at the demand of ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ferrara | author-link = Alessandro Ferrara | contribution = Beyond the limits of autonomy Rousseau's ethic of authenticity: B The limits of autonomy | editor-last = Ferrara | editor-link = Alessandro Ferrara | title = Modernity and authenticity: a study in the social and ethical thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau | page = 104 | year = 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

'''Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz''' (2 August 1924 – 20 August 2013) was a French historian and archaeologist. As an archaeologist he worked at [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]]. He has published numerous books including works on Qumran and the context of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

Laperrousaz is now ''professeur honoraire'' of the religious studies faculty of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and was formerly the director of that institution. He was a resident at the [[École Biblique|École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem]]. He has long been acquainted with Qumran, having been a participant in the excavations directed by [[Roland de Vaux]] from 1953 to 1956. From 1970 to 1995 Laperrousaz continued an archaeological mission to Jerusalem and the Qumran area on a yearly basis. Always a strong believer in the [[Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Qumran–Essene Theory|Qumran-Essene hypothesis]], he differed with de Vaux over interpretations of the site of Qumran. His most influential work is ''Qoumran: L'Etablissement essénien des bord de la Mer Morte: Histoire et archéologie du site'', an independent study of the archaeology of Qumran.

== Selected publications ==
Laperrousaz has been a prolific writer on archaeological subjects in French. Among his books are:

&lt;section begin=Lead /&gt;
&lt;!-- Lead section of this article transcluded in Developmental psychology --&gt;
'''Evolutionary developmental psychology''' ('''EDP''') is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the [[Developmental psychology|development]] of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M.

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Development and evolution ===
Like mainstream [[evolutionary psychology]], EDP is rooted in [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] theory of natural selection. Darwin himself emphasized development, using the process of embryology as evidence to support his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=John Murray|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=John Murray|year=1874|isbn=|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 1: The Evidence of the Descent of Man from Some Lower Form}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machluf|first=Karin|last2=Lidde|first2=James R.|last3=Bjorklund|first3=David F.|date=2014|title=An Introduction to Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/12/2/147470491401200201.full.pdf|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1177/147470491401200201|pmid=|access-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''The Descent of Man'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Man is developed from an ovule...which differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals. The embryo itself at a very early period can hardly be distinguished from that of other members of the vertebrate kingdom."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Darwin also published his observations of the development of one of his own sons in 1877, noting the child's emotional, moral, and linguistic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=1877|title=A Biographical Sketch of an Infant|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Darwin/infant.htm|journal=Mind|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this early emphasis on developmental processes, theories of evolution and theories of development have long been viewed as separate, or even opposed to one another (for additional background, see [[nature versus nurture]]). Since the advent of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], evolutionary theory has been primarily [[Gene-centered view of evolution|"gene-centric"]], and developmental processes have often been seen as incidental.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]]'s appraisal of development in 1973 illustrates this shift: "The details of embryological developmental processes, interesting as they may be, are irrelevant to evolutionary considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Selfish Gene |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= |location=Oxford |pages=62 |orig-year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] regarded ontogenetic variation as "developmental noise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sociobiology: The New Synthesis |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1975 |isbn= |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a consequence of this shift in perspective, many biologists interested in topics such as embryology and developmental systems subsequently branched off into [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morange |first=Michel |date=2011 |title=Evolutionary developmental biology its roots and characteristics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611001771 |journal=Developmental Biology |publisher=Elsevier |volume=357 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.013 |pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspectives in developmental psychology ===
Despite the minimization of development in evolutionary theory, early developmental psychology was influenced by evolution. Both Darwin's theory of evolution and [[Karl Ernst von Baer|Karl Ernst von Baer's]] developmental principles of ontogeny shaped early thought in developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://n.ereserve.fiu.edu/010026902-1.pdf|title=The Handbook of Developmental Psychology|last=Cairns|first=Robert B|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=|location=|pages=|chapter=The Making of Developmental Psychology|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thierry Preyer|Wilhelm T. Preyer]], a pioneer of child psychology, was heavily inspired by Darwin's work and approached the mental development of children from an evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/11304-030|title=Readings in the history of psychology|last=Preyer|first=Wilhelm|publisher=Century|year=1948|isbn=|location=East Norwalk, CT|pages=|chapter=The mind of the child|orig-year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evolutionary theory has had a limited impact on developmental psychology as a whole,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; and some authors argue that even its early influence was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=William R|date=1992|title=Darwin and developmental psychology: Past and present|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.5|pmid=|volume=28|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental psychology, as with the social sciences in general, has long been resistant to evolutionary theories of development&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; (with some notable exceptions, such as [[John Bowlby|John Bowlby's]] work on attachment theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment and loss|last=Bowlby|first=John|publisher=Hogarth|year=1969|isbn=|volume=Vol 1: Attachment|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary approaches to human behavior were, and to some extent continue to be, considered a form of genetic determinism and dismissive of the role of culture and experience in shaping human behavior (see [[Standard social science model]]).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture|last=Tooby|first=John|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|editor-last=Barkow|editor-first=Jerome H|location=New York|pages=19–139|chapter=The psychological foundations of culture|editor-last2=Cosmides|editor-first2=Leda|editor-last3=Tooby|editor-first3=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of developmental psychologists who have embraced evolutionary perspectives are [[Psychological nativism|nativists]], who argue than infants possess innate cognitive mechanisms (or modules) which allow them to acquire crucial information, such as language (for a prominent example, see [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/nativists.aspx|title=The nativists are restless|last=Price|first=Michael|date=9 October 2009|website=American Psychological Association Monitor on Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The inheritance and innateness of grammars|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K|last2=Meltzoff|first2=Andrew N|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0195115345|editor-last=Gopnik|editor-first=Myrna|location=|pages=7–44|chapter=Evolution, nativism, and learning in the development of language and speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary developmental psychology ===
Evolutionary developmental psychology can be viewed as a more focused theoretical framework derived from the larger field of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP). Mainstream evolutionary psychology grew out of earlier movements which applied the principles of evolutionary biology to understand the mind and behavior such as sociobiology, ethology, and behavioral ecology,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; differing from these earlier approaches by focusing on identifying [[psychological adaptation]]s rather than adaptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/epfaq/sociobiology.html|title=Is evolutionary psychology just a politically correct version of sociobiology?|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|date=|website=The Evolutionary Psychology FAQ|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While EDP theory generally aligns with that of mainstream EP, it is distinguished by a conscious effort to reconcile theories of both evolution and development.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; EDP theory diverges from mainstream evolutionary psychology in both the degree of importance placed on the environment in influencing behavior, and in how evolution has shaped the development of human psychology.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Advocates of EDP assert that evolutionary psychologists, while acknowledging the role of the environment in shaping behavior and making claims as to its effects, rarely develop explicit models (i.e., predictions of how the environment might shape behavior) to support their claims .&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDP seeks to distinguish itself from mainstream evolutionary psychology in this way by embracing a [[Developmental systems theory|developmental systems approach]], and emphasizing that function at one level of organization (e.g., the genetic level) effects organization at adjacent levels of an organization. Developmental systems theorists such as [[Robert Lickliter]] point out that the products of development are both genetic and epigenetic, and have questioned the strictly gene-centric view of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lickliter|first=Robert|last2=Honeycutt|first2=Hunter|date=2003|title=Developmental Dynamics: Toward a Biologically Plausible Evolutionary Psychology|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4826/6e82dec5e037507e05b20259207206d1c7b6.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|pages=819–835|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.819|pmid=14599279|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lickliter|first=Robert|date=2008|title=The growth of developmental thought: Implications for a new evolutionary psychology|url=|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|publisher=Elsevier|issue=26|pages=353–369|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors have rebutted the claim that mainstream evolutionary psychologists do not integrate developmental theory into their theoretical programs, and have further questioned the value of developmental systems theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Barrett|first3=H. Clark|date=2003|title=The Second Law of Thermodynamics Is the First Law of Psychology: Evolutionary Developmental Psychology and the Theory Of Tandem, Coordinated Inheritances: Comment on Lickliter and Honeycutt|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/barrett/tooby2003psychbull.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.858|pmid=14599284|access-date=2016-04-17|pages=858–865}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Evolutionary developmental psychology#Criticism|Criticism]]).

Additionally, evolutionary developmental psychologists emphasize research on psychological ''development'' and behaviors across the lifespan. Pioneers of EDP contrast their work with that of mainstream evolutionary psychologists, who they argue focus primarily on adults, especially on behaviors related to socializing and mating.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"/&gt;

Evolutionary developmental psychologists have worked to integrate evolutionary and developmental theories, attempting to synthesize the two without discarding the theoretical foundations of either. This effort is evident in the types of questions which researchers working in the EDP paradigm ask; in reference to [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas Tinbergen's]] [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]], EP typically focuses on evolutionary ("Why") questions, while EDP explicitly integrates proximate questions ("How"), with the assumption that a greater understanding of the former category will yield insights into the latter.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the following table for an overview of Tinbergen's questions.

==Basic assumptions==
The following list summarizes the broad theoretical assumptions of EDP. From "Evolutionary Developmental Psychology,"&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"/&gt; in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'':
# All evolutionarily-influenced characteristics in the phenotype of adults develop, and this requires examining not only the functioning of these characteristics in adults but also their [[ontogeny]].
# All evolved characteristics develop via continuous and bidirectional gene-environment interactions that emerge dynamically over time.
# Infants and children are prepared by natural selection to process some information more readily than others.
# Development is constrained by genetic, environmental, and cultural factors.
# Infants and children show a high degree of developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] and adaptive sensitivity to context.
# An extended childhood is needed in which to learn the complexities of human social communities.
# Many aspects of childhood serve as preparations for adulthood and were selected over the course of evolution (deferred adaptations).
# Some characteristics of infants and children were selected to serve an adaptive function at specific times in development and ''not'' as preparations for adulthood (ontogenetic adaptations).

== Developmental adaptations ==
EDP assumes that natural selection creates [[Psychological adaptation|adaptations]] for specific stages of development, rather than only specifying adult states.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Frequently, EDP researchers seek to identify such adaptations, which have been subdivided into deferred adaptations, ontogenetic adaptations, and conditional adaptations.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

=== Deferred adaptations ===
Some behaviors or traits exhibited during childhood or adolescence may have been selected to serve as preparations for adult life, a type of adaptation that evolutionary developmental psychologists have named "deferred adaptations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F|date=1997|title=The role of immaturity in human development|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=122|pages=153–169|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.122.2.153|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences in children's play may be an example of this type of adaptation: higher frequencies of "rough-and-tumble" play among boys, as well as content differences in fantasy play (cross-culturally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human ethology|last=Eibl-Eibesfeldt|first=Irenäus|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; girls engage in more "parenting" play than boys),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Male, female: The evolution of human sex differences|last=Geary|first=David C.|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2010|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; seem to serve as early preparation for the roles that men and women play in many extant contemporary societies, and, presumably, played over human evolutionary history.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

=== Ontogenetic adaptations ===
In contrast to deferred adaptations, which function to prepare individuals for future environments (i.e., adulthood), ontogenetic adaptations adapt individuals to their current environment.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; These adaptations serve a specific function during a particular period of development, after which they are discarded. Ontogenetic adaptations can be physiological (for example, when fetal mammals deriving nutrition and oxygen from the placenta before birth, but no longer utilize the placenta after birth) and psychological.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; David F. Bjorklund has argued that the imitation of facial gestures by infants, which has a predictable developmental window and seemingly different functions at different ages, shows evidence of being an ontogenetic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F|date=1987|title=A note on neonatal imitation|url=|journal=Developmental Review|issue=7|pages=86–92|doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90006-2|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conditional adaptations ===
EDP emphasizes that children display considerable developmental plasticity, and proposes a special type of adaptation to facilitate adaptive developmental plasticity, called a conditional adaptation. Conditional adaptations detect and respond to relevant environmental cues, altering developmental pathways in ways which better adapt an individual to their particular environment. These adaptations allow organisms to implement alternative and contingent [[Life history theory|life history strategies]], depending on environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=W.

Behaviors that benefit other members of one's social group, particularly those which appear costly to the [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] or "altruistic" individual, have received considerable attention from disciplines interested in the evolution of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosocial motives, emotions, and behavior: The better angels of our nature|last=Simpson|first=Jeffry A|last2=Beckes|first2=Lane|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2010|isbn=978-1433805462|editor-last=Mikulincer|editor-first=Mario|location=|pages=35–53|chapter=Evolutionary perspectives on prosocial behavior|editor-last2=Shaver|editor-first2=Phillip R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Tomasello has argued that cooperation and prosociality are evolved characteristics of human behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why we cooperate|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the emergence of "helping" behavior early in development (observed among 18-24 month old infants) as one piece of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warneken|first=Felix|last2=Tomasello|first2=Micheal|date=2006|title=Altruistic helping in human infants and young chimpanzees|url=|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1121448|pmid=|volume=311|pages=1301–1303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers investigating the ontogeny and evolution of human cooperation design experiments intended to reveal the prosociality of infants and young children, then compare children's performance with that of other animals, typically chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; While some of the helping behaviors exhibited by infants and young children has also been observed in chimpanzees, preschool-age children tend to display greater prosociality than both human-raised and semi-free-ranging adult chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warneken|first=Felix|last2=Hare|first2=Brian|last3=Melis|first3=Alicia P|last4=Hanus|first4=Daniel|last5=Tomasello|first5=Michael|date=2007|title=Spontaneous altruism by chimpanzees and young children|url=|journal=PLoS Biol|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050184|pmid=|volume=5|page=e184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life history strategies and developmental plasticity ===
EDP researchers emphasize that evolved strategies are context dependent, in the sense that a strategy which is optimal in one environment will often be sub-optimal in another environment. They argue that this will result in natural selection favoring "adaptive developmental plasticity," allowing an organism to alter its developmental trajectory in response to environmental cues.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Related to this is the idea of a [[Life history theory|life history strategy]], which can be conceptualized as a chain of resource-allocation decisions (e.g., allocating resources towards growth or towards reproduction) that an organism makes.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; Biologists have used life history theory to characterize between-species variation in resource-allocation in terms of a fast-slow continuum (see [[r/K selection theory]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pianka|first=Eric R|date=1970|title=On r-and K-selection|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=104|issue=940|pages=592–597|doi=10.1086/282697|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, some anthropologists and psychologists have applied this continuum to understand within-species variation in trade-offs between reproductive and somatic effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Kim|date=1993|title=Life history theory and evolutionary anthropology|url=|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|volume=2|issue=3|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueredo|first=Aurelio José|last2=Vásquez|first2=Geneva|last3=Brumbach|first3=Barbara H|last4=Sefcek|first4=Jon A|last5=Kirsner|first5=Beth R|last6=Jacobs|first6=W.J.|date=2005|title=The K-factor: Individual differences in life history strategy|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1349–1360|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.009|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Bruce J|last2=Figueredo|first2=Aurelio José|last3=Brumbach|first3=Barbara H|last4=Schlomer|first4=Gabriel L|date=2009|title=Fundamental dimensions of environmental risk: The impact of harsh versus unpredictable environments on the evolution and development of life history strategies|url=|journal=Human Nature|volume=20|issue=2|pages=204–268|doi=10.1007/s12110-009-9063-7|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that childhood environment and early life experiences are highly influential in determining an individual's life history strategy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzawa|first=Christopher W|last2=Bragg|first2=Jared M|date=2012|title=Plasticity in human life history strategy|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|issue=S6|doi=10.1086/667410|pmid=|pages=S369–S382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as exposure to violence, harsh child-rearing, and environmental unpredictability (e.g., frequent moving, unstable family composition) have been shown to correlate with the proposed behavioral indicators of "fast" life history strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Bruce J|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F|date=2012|title=Beyond mental health: An evolutionary analysis of development under risky and supportive environmental conditions|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=48|issue=3|doi=10.1037/a0027651|pmid=|pages=591–597}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., early sexual maturation, unstable couple relationships, impulsivity, and reduced cooperation), where current reproduction is prioritized over future reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[John Tooby]], [[Leda Cosmides]], and H. Clark Barrett have refuted claims that mainstream evolutionary psychology neglects development, arguing that their discipline is, in reality, exceptionally interested in and highly considerate of development. In particular, they cite cross-cultural studies as a sort of natural developmental "experiment," which can reveal the influence of culture in shaping developmental outcomes. The authors assert that the arguments of developmental systems theorists consists largely of [[truism]]s, of which evolutionary psychologists are well aware, and that [[developmental systems theory]] has no scientific value because it fails to generate any predictions.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Debra Lieberman similarly objected to the characterization of evolutionary psychology as ignorant of developmental principles. Lieberman argued that both developmental systems theorists and evolutionary psychologists share a common goal of uncovering species-typical cognitive architecture, as well as the ontogeny of that architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of mind: Fundamental questions and controversies|last=Lieberman|first=Debra|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Gangestad|editor-first=Steven W.|location=New York, NY|pages=193–202|chapter=Evolutionary Psychology and Developmental Systems Theory|editor-last2=Simpson|editor-first2=Jeffry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fermenting.jpg|thumb|Fermentation in progress: Bubbles of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] form a froth on top of the fermentation mixture.]]

'''Fermentation''' is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process that produces chemical changes in organic [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] through the action of [[enzymes]]. In [[biochemistry]], it is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] in the absence of oxygen. [[Fermentation in food processing|In the context of food production]], it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of [[microorganisms]] brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage.&lt;ref name="Hui 2004 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Hui | first=Y. H. | title=Handbook of vegetable preservation and processing | publisher=M.

In microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by the degradation of organic nutrients [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobically]].&lt;ref name="Prescott Microbiology"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072556781/information_center_view0/|title=Microbiology|author1=Klein, Donald W.|author2=Lansing M.|author3=Harley, John|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-255678-0|edition=6th|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the [[Neolithic age]]. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces [[lactic acid]] found in such sour [[food]]s as [[pickled cucumber]]s, [[kimchi]], and [[yogurt]], as well as for [[fermentation in winemaking|producing alcoholic beverages such as wine]] and [[beer]]. Fermentation occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Bowen|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/largegut/ferment.html|title=Microbial Fermentation|website=Hypertexts for biological sciences|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
Along with [[photosynthesis]] and [[aerobic respiration]], fermentation is a way of extracting energy from molecules, but it is the only one common to all bacteria and [[eukaryote]]s. It is therefore considered the oldest [[metabolic pathway]], suitable for an environment that does not yet have oxygen.&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;{{rp|389}} Yeast, a form of [[fungus]], occurs in almost any environment capable of supporting microbes, from the skins of fruits to the guts of insects and mammals and the deep ocean, and they harvest sugar-rich materials to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martini|first1=A.|title=Biodiversity and conservation of yeasts|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|date=1992|volume=1|issue=4|pages=324–333|doi=10.1007/BF00693768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=D.|last2=Howe|first2=A.|last3=Brown|first3=N.|last4=Barton|first4=H.|last5=Demidova|first5=M.|last6=Michelle|first6=H.|last7=Li|first7=L.|last8=Sanders|first8=H.|last9=Watkinson|first9=S.

The basic mechanism for fermentation remains present in all cells of higher organisms. [[Mammal]]ian [[muscle]] carries out the fermentation that occurs during periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in the creation of [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Donald|last2=Voet|first2=Judith G.|title=Biochemistry|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Global Education|isbn=9781118139936|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} In [[invertebrates]], fermentation also produces [[succinate]] and [[alanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broda|first1=E|title=The Evolution of the Bioenergetic Processes|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781483136134}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}

Fermentative bacteria play an essential role in the production of methane in habitats ranging from the [[rumen]]s of cattle to sewage digesters and freshwater sediments. They produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, [[formate]] and [[acetate]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s; and then consortia of microbes convert the carbon dioxide and acetate to methane. Acetogenic bacteria oxidize the acids, obtaining more acetate and either hydrogen or formate. Finally, [[methanogenesis|methanogens]] (which are in the domain ''[[Archea]]'') convert acetate to methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferry|first1=J G|title=Methane from acetate.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=September 1992|volume=174|issue=17|pages=5489–5495|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5489-5495.1992|pmc=206491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial]] outer membrane is omitted.]]Fermentation reacts [[NADH]] with an [[Endogeny|endogenous]], [[organic compound|organic]] [[electron acceptor]].&lt;ref name="Prescott Microbiology"/&gt; Usually this is [[pyruvate]] formed from sugar through [[glycolysis]]. The reaction produces [[NAD+]] and an organic product, typical examples being [[ethanol]], [[lactic acid]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]. However, more exotic compounds can be produced by fermentation, such as [[butyric acid]] and [[acetone]]. Fermentation products contain chemical energy (they are not fully oxidized), but are considered waste products, since they cannot be metabolized further without the use of oxygen.

Fermentation normally occurs in an [[anaerobic environment]]. In the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NADH, and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]]. This is called [[oxidative phosphorylation]], and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that reason, fermentation is rarely utilized when oxygen is available. However, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, some strains of [[yeast]] such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' prefer fermentation to [[aerobic respiration]] as long as there is an adequate supply of [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugars]] (a phenomenon known as the [[Crabtree effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piškur|first1=Jure|last2=Compagno|first2=Concetta|title=Molecular mechanisms in yeast carbon metabolism|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642550133|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fermentation processes involve [[obligate anaerobe]]s, which cannot tolerate oxygen.

Although [[yeast]] carries out the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in the production of [[ethanol]] in [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent: [[bacteria]] carry out the fermentation in the production of [[xanthan gum]].

The figure illustrates the process. Before fermentation, a glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate molecules. The energy from this [[exothermic reaction]] is used to bind inorganic [[phosphate]]s to ATP and convert NAD+ to NADH. The pyruvates break down into two [[acetaldehyde]] molecules and give off two [[carbon dioxide]] molecules as a waste product. The acetaldehyde is reduced into ethanol using the energy and hydrogen from NADH, and the NADH is oxidized into NAD+ so that the cycle may repeat. The reaction is catalysed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/&gt;

===Lactic acid===
{{Main|Lactic acid fermentation}}

''Homolactic fermentation'' (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis&lt;ref name="Introductory Botany 2007. p. 86"&gt;Introductory Botany: plants, people, and the Environment. Berg, Linda R. Cengage Learning, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-534-46669-5}}.  p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; undergoes a simple [[redox]] reaction, forming [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61"&gt;AP Biology. Anestis, Mark. 2nd Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-07-147630-0}}. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volume 3. Thorpe 1922. p.159"&gt;A dictionary of applied chemistry, Volume 3. Thorpe, Sir Thomas Edward. Longmans, Green and Co., 1922. p.159&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique because it is one of the only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHOHCOOH
It occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the [[blood]] can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of [[bacterium|bacteria]] (such as [[lactobacilli]]) and some [[fungi]]. It is the type of bacteria that converts [[lactose]] into lactic acid in [[yogurt]], giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either [[homolactic fermentation]], where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or ''Heterolactic fermentation'', where some lactate is further metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide&lt;ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61"/&gt; (via the [[phosphoketolase]] pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHOHCOOH + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
If lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula):
:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
Heterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between [[lactic acid fermentation]] and other types, e.g. [[alcoholic fermentation]] (see [[Fermentation#Hydrogen gas production in fermentation|below]]). The reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:
*The acidity of lactic acid impedes biological processes. This can be beneficial to the fermenting organism as it drives out competitors that are unadapted to the acidity. As a result, the food will have a longer shelf life (part of the reason foods are purposely fermented in the first place); however, beyond a certain point, the acidity starts affecting the organism that produces it.
*The high concentration of lactic acid (the final product of fermentation) drives the equilibrium backwards ([[Le Chatelier's principle]]), decreasing the rate at which fermentation can occur and slowing down growth.
*Ethanol, into which lactic acid can be easily converted, is volatile and will readily escape, allowing the reaction to proceed easily. [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is also produced, but it is only weakly acidic and even more volatile than ethanol.
*Acetic acid (another conversion product) is acidic and not as volatile as ethanol; however, in the presence of limited oxygen, its creation from lactic acid releases additional energy. It is a lighter molecule than lactic acid, that forms fewer hydrogen bonds with its surroundings (due to having fewer groups that can form such bonds), thus is more volatile and will also allow the reaction to move forward more quickly.
*If [[propionic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and longer monocarboxylic acids are produced (see [[mixed acid fermentation]]), the amount of acidity produced per glucose consumed will decrease, as with ethanol, allowing faster growth.

===Hydrogen gas===
{{Main|Fermentative hydrogen production}}
[[Hydrogen]] gas is produced in many types of fermentation ([[mixed acid fermentation]], [[butyric acid]] fermentation, [[caproate]] fermentation, [[butanol]] fermentation, [[glyoxylate]] fermentation) as a way to regenerate NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from NADH. [[Electron]]s are transferred to [[ferredoxin]], which in turn is oxidized by [[hydrogenase]], producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/&gt; Hydrogen gas is a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[methanogen]]s and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reducer]]s, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the production of such an energy-rich compound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Glucose could theoretically be converted into just CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the global reaction releases little energy.

==Modes of operation==
Most industrial fermentation uses batch or fed-batch procedures, although continuous fermentation can be more economical if various challenges, particularly the difficulty of maintaining sterility, can be met.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Teng|last2=Chen|first2=Xiang-bin|last3=Chen|first3=Jin-chun|last4=Wu|first4=Qiong|last5=Chen|first5=Guo-Qiang|title=Open and continuous fermentation: Products, conditions and bioprocess economy|journal=Biotechnology Journal|date=December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1503–1511|doi=10.1002/biot.201400084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batch===
In a batch process, all the ingredients are combined and the reactions proceed without any further input. Batch fermentation has been used for millennia to make bread and alcoholic beverages, and it is still a common method, especially when the process is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Cinar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cinar|first1=Ali|last2=Parulekar|first2=Satish J.|last3=Undey|first3=Cenk|last4=Birol|first4=Gulnur|title=Batch fermentation modeling, monitoring, and control.|date=2003|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=9780203911358}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} However, it can be expensive because the fermentor must be sterilized using high pressure steam between batches.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; Strictly speaking, there is often addition of small quantities of chemicals to control the pH or suppress foaming.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|25}}

Batch fermentation goes through a series of phases. There is a lag phase in which cells adjust to their environment; then a phase in which exponential growth occurs. Once many of the nutrients have been consumed, the growth slows and becomes non-exponential, but production of ''secondary metabolites'' (including commercially important antibiotics and enzymes) accelerates. This continues through a stationary phase after most of the nutrients have been consumed, and then the cells die.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|25}}

===Fed-batch===
{{See also|Fed-batch culture}}
Fed-batch fermentation is a variation of batch fermentation where some of the ingredients are added during the fermentation. This allows greater control over the stages of the process. In particular, production of secondary metabolites can be increased by adding a limited quantity of nutrients during the non-exponential growth phase. Fed-batch operations are often sandwiched between batch operations.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmid|first1=Rolf D.|last2=Schmidt-Dannert|first2=Claudia|title=Biotechnology : an illustrated primer|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527335152|edition=Second|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open===
The high cost of sterilizing the fermentor between batches can be avoided using various open fermentation approaches that are able to resist contamination. One is to use a naturally evolved mixed culture. This is particularly favored in wastewater treatment, since mixed populations can adapt to a wide variety of wastes. [[Thermophile|Thermophilic]] bacteria can produce lactic acid at temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius, sufficient to discourage microbial contamination; and ethanol has been produced at a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°C. This is just below its boiling point (78&amp;nbsp;°C), making it easy to extract. [[Halophile|Halophilic]] bacteria can produce bioplastics in hypersaline conditions. Solid-state fermentation adds a small amount of water to a solid substrate; it is widely used in the food industry to produce flavors, enzymes and organic acids.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt;

===Continuous===
In continuous fermentation, substrates are added and final products removed continuously.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; There are three varieties: [[chemostat]]s, which hold nutrient levels constant; [[turbidostat]]s, which keep cell mass constant; and [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactors]] in which the culture medium flows steadily through a tube while the cells are recycled from the outlet to the inlet.&lt;ref name=Schmid/&gt; If the process works well, there is a steady flow of feed and effluent and the costs of repeatedly setting up a batch are avoided. Also, it can prolong the exponential growth phase and avoid byproducts that inhibit the reactions by continuously removing them. However, it is difficult to maintain a steady state and avoid contamination, and the design tends to be complex.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; Typically the fermentor must run for over 500 hours to be more economical than batch processors.&lt;ref name=Schmid/&gt;

==History of human use==
The use of [[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]], particularly for [[alcoholic beverage|beverages]], has existed since the [[Neolithic]] and has been documented dating from 7000–6600 BCE in [[Jiahu]], [[Neolithic China|China]],&lt;ref name="mcgovern"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGovern | first1 = P.

The turning point came when [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895), during the 1850s and 1860s, repeated Schwann's experiments and showed that fermentation is initiated by living organisms in a series of investigations.&lt;ref name="Volume 3. Thorpe 1922. p.159"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lengeler/&gt;{{rp|6}} In 1857, Pasteur showed that lactic acid fermentation is caused by living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjcollazo.com/fjc_publishings/documents/LPasteurRpt.htm Accomplishments of Louis Pasteur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130000148/http://www.fjcollazo.com/fjc_publishings/documents/LPasteurRpt.htm |date=2010-11-30 }}. Fjcollazo.com (2005-12-30). Retrieved on 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, he demonstrated that bacteria cause [[souring]] in milk, a process formerly thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in identifying the role of microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of [[pasteurization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/chemists/louis-pasteur-info.htm HowStuffWorks "Louis Pasteur"]. Science.howstuffworks.com (2009-07-01). Retrieved on 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, working to improve the French [[brewing industry]], Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, "''Etudes sur la Bière''", which was translated into English in 1879 as "Studies on fermentation".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Pasteur (1879) Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them. Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined fermentation (incorrectly) as "Life without air",&lt;ref name="Modern History Sourcebook 1895"&gt;Modern History Sourcebook: Louis Pasteur (1822–1895): Physiological theory of fermentation, 1879. Translated by F. Faulkner, D.C. Robb.&lt;/ref&gt; but correctly showed that specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-products.

Although showing fermentation to be the result of the action of living microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of the fermentation process, or prove that it is caused by the microorganisms that appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation [[enzyme]] from [[yeast]].&lt;ref name="Modern History Sourcebook 1895"/&gt; Success came in 1897 when the German chemist [[Eduard Buechner]] ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this "dead" liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFrBP8S7my4C&amp;pg=PA25 New beer in an old bottle]: Eduard Buchner and the Growth of Biochemical Knowledge. Cornish-Bowden, Athel. Universitat de Valencia. 1997. {{ISBN|978-84-370-3328-0}}. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry.  The "unorganized ferments" behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cP1IrqiBPCwC&amp;pg=PA7 The enigma of ferment: from the philosopher's stone to the first biochemical Nobel prize]. Lagerkvist, Ulf. World Scientific Publishers. 2005. {{ISBN|978-981-256-421-4}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Buechner won the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] for his work.&lt;ref&gt;A treasury of world science, Volume 1962, Part 1. Runes, Dagobert David. Philosophical Library Publishers. 1962. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up until the present. For example, in the 1930s, it was discovered that microorganisms could be [[mutation|mutated]] with physical and chemical treatments to be higher-yielding, faster-growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a more concentrated medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinkraus |first1=Keith |title=Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods |date=2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781351442510 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=H.

==Etymology==
The word "ferment" is derived from the Latin verb ''fervere'', which means to boil. It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in [[alchemy]], but only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until around 1600.

A '''fibrous root system''' is the opposite of a [[taproot]] system. It is usually formed by thin, moderately branching [[root]]s growing from the [[Plant stem|stem]].  A fibrous root system is universal in [[monocotyledon]]ous plants and [[fern]]s. The fibrous root systems look like a mat made out of roots when the tree has reached full maturity.

Most [[tree]]s begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years change to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal surface roots and only a few vertical, deep anchoring roots. A typical mature tree 30–50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil.

A few plants with fibrous root systems:
* [[Coconut]] palm&lt;ref&gt;Thampan, P.K. (1981). ''Handbook on Coconut Palm''. Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grass]]
* 
Fibrous roots grow fairly close to the surface of the ground.
Leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.

Forages have a fibrous root system, which helps combat erosion by anchoring the plants to the top layer of the soil, and covering the entirety of the field, as it is a non-row crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/advantages-fibrous-root-taproot-systems-104165.html|title=The Advantages of the Fibrous Root &amp; Taproot Systems|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fibrous root system, the roots grow downwards into the soil, and also branch off sideways throughout the soil. This forms a mass of fine roots, with no distinct tap root, because the embryonic root dies back while the plant is still young and growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cropsreview.com/fibrous-root.html|title=Taproot and Fibrous Root Systems, Specialized Roots|newspaper=CropsReview.Com|author=Bareja, Ben G. |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Field Archaeology Act'' is a state Act legislating the preservation, interpretation and protection of [[archaeology]] in  the state of [[Minnesota]], [[United States of America]]. The Act is divided into twelve sections.

== Passage and revisions ==
The Act was first brought into force in 1963 and has undergone ten revisions since that time.

== Effects ==
The passage of the Field Archaeology Act in 1963 impacted the practice of archaeology in Minnesota in several critical ways. It provided proscriptions related to the practice of archaeology, banned unlicensed practitioners from conducting archaeological investigations on state sites, and enacted penalties for violations of the Act. It also officially established the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist, and outlined the licensing process and requirements for archaeologists seeking to work on state sites. In terms of physical archaeological remains and data recovered as a result of field archaeology, the Act explicitly granted ownership and title to the state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=138|title=Field Archaeology Act|last=|first=|publisher=Revisor of Statutes|year=1963|isbn=|location=Minnesota, United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological protection ==
The Act affords protection to state archaeological sites under Section 138.32, in that the state "reserves to itself the exclusive right and privilege of field archaeology on state sites, in order to protect and preserve archaeological and scientific information, matter, and objects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist ==
The Act defines the position of the State Archaeologist, and dictates the lawful duties thereof. The Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist is charged with the following duties:
* Acts as the agent of the state to enforce the Act. 
* Sponsors, engages in, and directs fundamental archaeological research.
* Cooperates with agencies to preserve and interpret archaeological sites.
* Encourages protection of archaeological sites on private property.
* Retrieves and protects artifacts and data discovered on public property.
* Retrieves and protects archaeological remains disturbed by agency construction.
* Helps preserve artifacts and data recovered by archaeological work.
* Disseminates archaeological information through report publication.
* Approves archaeologist's qualifications for licensing to work on public property.
* Formulates licensing provisions for archaeological work on public property.
* Issues emergency licenses for archaeological work on public property.
* Revokes or suspends archaeological licenses due to good cause
* Approves curation arrangements of artifacts and data from state sites.
* Repossesses artifacts from state sites that are not being properly curated.
* Consults with the Minnesota Historical Society and Minnesota Indian Affairs Council regarding significant field archaeology.
* Completes annual reports about the Office of the State Archaeologist's and licensees' activities.
* Reviews and comments on agency development plans that may affect state sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/|title=Our Role|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Archaeological licensing ==
The Act provides that any archaeological work conducted on non-federal public land in Minnesota, requires a permit issued by the Office of the State Archaeologist. There are four kinds of licenses, including 
* Yearly license for reconnaissance/Phase I survey.
* Site-specific license for site evaluations/Phase II.
* Site-specific license for major excavations/Phase III.
* Site-specific license for burial authentications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/professional-archaeologists/manuals-licenses/license-types/|title=License Types|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State archaeologist provides a review and vetting of an archaeologist's qualifications, and forwards the application onto the Minnesota Historical Society for license issuance.

== Burial grounds ==
Burial grounds and cemeteries in Minnesota are governed by the ''[[Private Cemeteries Act (Minnesota)|Private Cemeteries Act]]''. The Act was first enacted in 1976, and has been amended eight times, most recently in 2007. The State Archaeologist oversees the implementation of this Act and has the following associated duties: 
* Authenticates all unrecorded burial sites over 50 years old
* Grants permission for disturbances in unrecorded non-Indian cemeteries.
* Allows posting and approves signs for authenticated non-Indian cemeteries.
* Maintains unrecorded cemetery data.
* Provides burial sites data to the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGEO) -- formerly the Land Management Information Center (LMIC).
* Determines the ethnic identity of burials over 50 years old.
* Helps determine tribal affiliation of Indian burials.
* Determines if osteological analysis should be done on recovered remains.
* Helps establish provisions for dealing with unaffiliated Indian remains.
* Reviews development plans that may impact unrecorded burials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/the-public/resources/laws-and-statutes/|title=Laws and Statutes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firdeusi Institute Logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Seal of Firdeusi Institute for Persian Studies]]

Firdeusi (eng: Ferdowsi) Institute for Iranian and Persian Studies is a non-for-profit and non-governmental organisation, which scientific and research activity is conducted autonomously, and is not based on political or religious matters. The Institute has been established in the form of “Center” (with no membership) by two founders: [[Marin Barleti University]] and Iranian Cultural Foundation “Saadi Shirazi” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.iranalbania.ir|title=Official web-site of Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation|work= iranalbania.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the Cooperation agreement held in October 6, 2010. The ceremony of launching was held  on 29 October 2010, initiating the functioning of the first research institute for Persian studies in Albania, at University level.

The '''Institute name''' “Firdeusi” (eng: Ferdowsi) comes the greatest Persian poets, thinkers and writers, Abul-Kasim Hasan Pur-Ali Tusi Ferdowsi, known otherwise as the Father of the Iranology Studies worldwide. The choice came also as a tribute to the “Ferdowsi [[Shahnameh]] Millenium” proclaimed by [[UNESCO]]  in 2010.
The Institute Logo has been inspired by the poet’s name and is interwoven with calligraphy elements from the [[Persian language]]. Logo represents an open book, being a metaphor of the scientific character of the Institute.

==Persian studies in Albania==
Iranian studies in Albania although not academically pursued, have always enjoyed Albanian people interest. The diffusion of Persian literature and culture in Albania is closely linked with the presence of Ottoman Empire in Albania and with the heavy influence Persian culture exerted on the Ottoman administration and Turkish culture of the era. Another key factor in the popularisation of Persian culture among Albanians is the expansion of Islam in the territories lived in by Albanians during the 16th and 17th centuries. Meanwhile, during the 19th century, the Persian language was widely used among Albanian intellectuals.

Naim and Sami Frashëri were among the most prominent scholars of oriental and Iranian studies in Albania. Naim Frashëri published two books in Persian: the first, ''Grammar of the Persian Language'' was published in 1871, while the second one, a compilation of poems in Persian, ''Tehajjulat''" was published in 1885. These represented the cornerstone of Persian literature and culture in Albania.

Other personalities of Iranology in Albania include: Vexhi Buharaja, translator into Albanian language of many Persian books (such as “Gjylistani dhe Bostani” “3500 verses from Shahname”, etc.), [[Tahir Dizdari]], author of “Persian words in Albanian language”, Hafiz Ali Korca and Fan Noli, with his  translation of Omar Khajam’s famous “quatrains”, Dalan Shapllo, scholar, writer and translator of Hafiz Shirazi’s mystical poems and many more contemporaneous Albanian linguists, scholars and writers.

[[Krypton-85]], half-life 10.76 years, is formed by the fission process with
a fission yield of about 0.3%. Only 20% of the '''fission products''' of mass 85 become &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr itself; the rest passes through a short-lived [[nuclear isomer]] and then to stable &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb. If irradiated reactor fuel is [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]], this radioactive [[krypton]] may be released into the air. This krypton release can be detected and used as a means of detecting clandestine nuclear reprocessing. Strictly speaking, the stage which is detected is the dissolution of [[used nuclear fuel]] in [[nitric acid]], as it is at this stage that the krypton and other fission gases like the more abundant [[xenon]] are released.

Increase of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] gases above a certain limit can lead to fuel pin swelling and even puncture, so that fission gas measurement after discharging the fuel from the reactor is most important to make burn-up calculations, to study the nature of fuel inside the reactor, behaviour with pin materials, for effective utilization of fuel and also reactor safety.

The [[strontium]] radioisotopes are very important as strontium is a [[calcium]] mimic which is incorporated in bone growth and therefore has a great ability to harm humans. On the other hand, this also allows &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr to be used in the open source [[radiotherapy]] of [[bone tumor]]s. This tends to be used in [[palliative]] care to reduce the pain due to secondary [[tumor]]s in the [[bone]]s.

[[Strontium-90]] is a strong [[beta decay|beta]] emitter with a [[half-life]] of 28.8 years. Its [[fission product yield]] decreases as the mass of the [[fissile]] nuclide increases. A map of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr  contamination around [[Chernobyl]] has been published by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The only stable [[yttrium]] isotope, &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y, will be found with yield somewhat less than 1% in a fission product mixture which has been allowed to age for months or years, as the other isotopes have half-lives of 106.6 days or less.

&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr decays into &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y which is a beta emitter with a half-life of 2.67 days.
&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y is sometimes used for [[medical]] purposes and can be obtained either by the [[neutron activation]] of stable &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y or by using a device similar to a [[technetium cow]].

A significant amount of [[zirconium]] is formed by the fission process; some of this are short-lived radioactives (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr and &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr which decay to [[molybdenum]]), while almost 10% of the fission products mixture after years of decay consists of five stable or nearly stable isotopes of zirconium plus [[Zirconium-93|&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr]] with a halflife of 1.53 million years which is one of the 7 major [[long-lived fission product]]s.

In [[PUREX]] plants the zirconium sometimes forms a [[third phase]] which can be a disturbance in the plant. The third phase is the term in solvent extraction given to a third layer (such as [[foam]] and/or emulsion) which forms from the two layers in the solvent extraction process. The zirconium forms the third phase by forming small particles which stabilise the [[emulsion]] which is the third phase.

Niobium-95 with a halflife of 35 days is initially present as a fission product. The only stable isotope of [[niobium]] has mass number 93, and fission products of mass 93 become relatively stable zirconium-93 (half life 1.53 Ma).

[[technetium-99|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], half-life 211k years, is produced at a yield of about 6% per fission; see also the main [[fission product]]s page.

Plenty of both stable [[ruthenium]] and radioactive ruthenium-103 is formed by the fission process. The ruthenium in [[PUREX raffinate]] can become oxidized to form [[ruthenium tetroxide]] which forms a purple vapour above the surface of the aqueous liquor. The ruthenium tetroxide is very similar to [[osmium tetroxide]], the ruthenium compound is a stronger oxidant which enables it to form deposits by reacting with other substances. In this way the ruthenium in a reprocessing plant is very mobile and can be found in odd places. Also at [[Chernobyl]] during the fire the ruthenium became volatile and behaved differently from many of the other metallic fission products. Some of the particles which were emitted by the fire were very rich in ruthenium.

In addition the ruthenium in PUREX [[raffinate]] forms a large number of [[nitrosyl]] complexes which makes the chemistry of the ruthenium very complex. The [[ligand]] exchange rate at ruthenium and [[rhodium]] tends to be long, hence it can take a long time for a ruthenium or rhodium compound to react.

It has been suggested that the ruthenium and palladium in PUREX raffinate should be used as a source of the metals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/pt/docs/iem/jeju02/session2/SessionII-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiae.ru/eng/inf/tex/t52.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhodium-103 ==
{|
|{{Iso2|103|Rh|R}}|| ||{{Iso2|105|Rh|V}}
|}
While less rhodium than ruthenium and palladium is formed (around 3.6% yield), the mixture of fission products still contains a significant amount of this metal. Due to the high prices of ruthenium, [[rhodium]] and palladium some work has been done on the separation of these metals to enable them to be used at a later date. Because of the possibility of the metals being contaminated by radioactive isotopes, metals are not suitable for making consumer products such as [[jewellery]] but this source of the metals could be used for [[catalyst]]s in industrial plants such as petrochemical plants.

Potential Applications of Fission Platinoids in Industry, Zdenek Kolarik, ''Platinum Metals Review'', 2005, '''49''', April (2).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/dynamic/&lt;/ref&gt;

A dire example of people being exposed to radiation from contaminated jewellery occurred in the United States where it is thought that the [[gold]] seeds which were used to contain [[radon]] were [[recycle]]d into jewellery. The gold did contain radioactive decay products of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hpposters/goldjewelry.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

A great deal of [[palladium]] forms during the fission process. In [[nuclear reprocessing]], not all of the fission palladium dissolves; also some palladium that dissolves at first comes out of solution later. Palladium-rich dissolver fines (particles) are often removed as they interfere with the solvent extraction process by stabilising the [[third phase]].

The fission palladium can separate during the process in which the [[PUREX raffinate]] is combined with [[glass]] and heated to form the final [[high level waste]] form. The palladium forms an [[alloy]] with the fission tellurium. This alloy can separate from the glass.

[[Isotopes of tellurium|Tellurium-128 and -130]] are essentially stable. They only decay by [[double beta decay]], with half lives &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.  They constitute the major fraction of natural occurring [[tellurium]] at 32 and 34% respectively.
[[Tellurium-132]] and its daughter &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of iodine|I]] are important in the first few days after a criticality. It was responsible for a large fraction of the dose inflicted on workers at [[Chernobyl]] in the first week.

The [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] forming &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Te/&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;I is: [[Tin-132]] (half-life 40 s) decaying to [[antimony-132]] (half-life 2.8 minutes) decaying to [[tellurium-132]] (half-life 3.2 days) decaying to [[iodine-132]] (half-life 2.3 hours) which decays to stable xenon-132.

The creation of [[tellurium-126]] is delayed by the long half-life (230 k years) of [[tin-126]].

[[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life of 8 days, is a hazard from [[nuclear fallout]] because iodine concentrates in the [[thyroid gland]]. See also [[Radiation effects from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Iodine-131]] and
[[Downwinders#Nevada]].

In common with &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I is used for the treatment of [[cancer]]. A small dose of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I can be used in a thyroid function test while a large dose can be used to destroy the thyroid cancer. This treatment will also normally seek out and destroy any secondary [[tumor]] which arose from a thyroid cancer. Much of the energy from the [[Beta particle|beta]] emission from the &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I will be absorbed in the thyroid, while the [[gamma ray]]s are likely to be able to escape from the thyroid to irradiate other parts of the body.

Large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I was released during an experiment named the [[Green Run]]&lt;ref&gt;{{web archive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which fuel which had only been allowed to cool for a short time after irradiation was reprocessed in a plant which had no iodine scrubber in operation.

[[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life almost a billion times as long, is a [[long-lived fission product]].

[[Iodine-127|&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is stable, the only one of the [[isotopes of iodine]] that is nonradioactive. It makes up only about {{frac|1|6}} of the iodine in spent fuel, with I-129 about {{frac|5|6}}.

In reactor fuel, the fission product [[xenon]] tends to migrate to form [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s in the fuel. As caesium 133, 135, and 137 are formed by the [[beta particle]] decay of the corresponding xenon isotopes, this causes the caesium to become physically separated from the bulk of the uranium oxide fuel.

Because &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is a potent [[nuclear poison]] with a large [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[neutron]] absorption, the buildup of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe can build up through decay of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe will be quickly consumed through [[neutron capture]] reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems may not be able to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe burns off. It is thought that [[xenon poisoning]] was one of the factors which led to the power surge which damaged the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] reactor core.

[[Caesium-137]] with a half-life of 30 years is the main [[medium-lived fission product]], along with Sr-90.
Cs-137 is the primary source of penetrating [[gamma radiation]] from spent fuel until 300 years or more after discharge.
It is the most significant radioisotope left in the area around [[Chernobyl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap1.html IAEA map]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesium-134]] is found in [[spent nuclear fuel]] but is not produced by [[nuclear weapon]] explosions, as it is only formed by [[neutron capture]] on stable Cs-133, which is only produced by [[beta decay]] of Xe-133 with a half-life of 3 days. Cs-134 has a half-life of 2 years and may be a major source of gamma radiation in the first few years after discharge.

[[Caesium-135]] is a [[long-lived fission product]] with much weaker radioactivity. [[Neutron capture]] inside the reactor diverts much of the [[xenon-135]] that would otherwise decay to Cs-135.

A lot of [[barium]] is formed by the fission process, a short lived barium isotope was confused with radium by some early workers. They were bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to form a new element. But instead they caused fission which generated a large amount of radioactivity in the target. Because the chemistry of barium and radium the two elements could be coseparated by for instance a precipitation with [[sulfate]] anions. Because of this similarity of their chemistry the early workers thought that the very radioactive fraction which was separated into the "radium" fraction contained a new isotope of radium. Some of this early work was done by [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]].

A great deal of the lighter [[lanthanide]]s ([[lanthanum]], [[cerium]], [[neodymium]], and [[samarium]]) are formed as fission products. In [[Africa]] at [[Oklo]] where the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] operated millions of years ago the isotopic mixture of neodymium is not the same as 'normal' neodymium, it has an isotope pattern very similar to the neodymium formed by fission.

In the aftermath of [[criticality accident]]s the level of &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;La is often used to determine the fission yield (in terms of the number of nuclei which underwent fission).

[[Samarium-149]] is the second most important [[neutron poison]] in nuclear reactor physics. [[Samarium-151]], produced at lower yields, is the third most abundant [[medium-lived fission product]] but emits only weak [[beta radiation]]. Both have high neutron absorption cross-sections, so that much of them produced in a reactor are later destroyed there by neutron absorption.

[[File:AtmosphericModelSchematic.png|thumb|right|350px|Climate models are systems of [[differential equation]]s based on the basic laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]]. To "run" a model, scientists divide the planet into a 3-dimensional grid, apply the basic equations, and evaluate the results.

A '''general circulation model''' ('''GCM''') is a type of [[climate model]]. It employs a [[mathematical model]] of the general circulation of a planetary [[atmosphere]] or ocean. It uses the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] on a rotating sphere with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] terms for various energy sources ([[radiation]], [[latent heat]]). These equations are the basis for computer programs used to [[simulation|simulate]] the Earth's atmosphere or oceans. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and [[Ocean general circulation model|OGCM]]) are key components along with [[sea ice]] and land-surface components.

GCMs and global climate models are used for [[weather forecasting]], understanding the [[climate]] and forecasting [[climate change]].

Versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were originally created by [[Syukuro Manabe]] and [[Kirk Bryan (oceanographer)|Kirk Bryan]] at the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL) in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="noaa200"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html |title=: The First Climate Model |publisher=NOAA 200th Celebration |year=2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical, chemical and sometimes biological equations.

==Terminology==
The acronym ''GCM'' originally stood for ''General Circulation Model''. Recently, a second meaning came into use, namely ''Global Climate Model''. While these do not refer to the same thing, General Circulation Models are typically the tools used for [[climate model|modelling climate]], and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the term "global climate model" is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model, or may refer to the general class of [[climate model]]s that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically.

==History==
{{See also|Numerical weather prediction#History}}
In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the [[troposphere]]. It became the first successful [[climate model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Atmospheric and oceanic models==
{{Further|Atmospheric model|Oceanic model}}
Atmospheric (AGCMs) and oceanic GCMs (OGCMs) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (CGCM or AOGCM). With the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for [[evapotranspiration]] over land, AOGCMs become the basis for a full climate model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pubs.GISS: Sun and Hansen 2003: Climate simulations for 1951-2050 with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model|url = http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/su04000r.html|website = pubs.giss.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-25|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
A recent trend in GCMs is to apply them as components of Earth system models, e.g. by coupling [[ice sheet model]]s for the dynamics of the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s, and one or more [[chemical transport model]]s (CTMs) for [[chemical species|species]] important to climate. Thus a [[Carbon cycle#Carbon cycle modelling|carbon CTM]] may allow a GCM to better predict [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] changes in [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations. In addition, this approach allows accounting for inter-system feedback: e.g. chemistry-climate models allow the possible effects of climate change on [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theozonehole.com/climate.htm |title=Tango in the Atmosphere: Ozone and Climate Change |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |accessdate=20 April 2010 |date=February 2004 |first=Jeannie |last=Allen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Three-dimensional (more properly four-dimensional) GCMs apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time. They contain parameterisations for processes such as [[convection]] that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

A simple general circulation model (SGCM) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity. Examples are programs that solve the [[primitive equations]], given energy input and energy [[dissipation]] in the form of scale-dependent [[friction]], so that [[atmospheric wave]]s with the highest [[wavenumber]]s are most attenuated. Such models may be used to study atmospheric processes, but are not suitable for climate projections.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere (and typically contain a land-surface model as well) using imposed [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/index.php |title=Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project |publisher=The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may include atmospheric chemistry.

AGCMs consist of a dynamical core which integrates the equations of fluid motion, typically for:

* surface pressure
* horizontal components of velocity in layers
* temperature and water vapor in layers
* radiation, split into solar/short wave and terrestrial/[[infrared]]/long wave
* [[Parametrization (climate)|parameters]] for:
** convection
** land surface processes
** [[albedo]] 
** [[hydrology]]
** cloud cover

A GCM contains [[prognostic equation]]s that are a function of time (typically winds, temperature, moisture, and surface pressure) together with [[diagnostic equation]]s that are evaluated from them for a specific time period. As an example, pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the [[hydrostatic equation]] to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest. Pressure is used to compute the pressure gradient force in the time-dependent equation for the winds.

OGCMs model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may contain a [[sea ice]] model. For example, the standard resolution of [[HadCM3#Ocean model (HadOM3)|HadOM3]] is 1.25 degrees in latitude and longitude, with 20 vertical levels, leading to approximately 1,500,000 variables.

AOGCMs (e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[GFDL CM2.X]]) combine the two submodels. They remove the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface. These models are the basis for model predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. AOGCMs internalise as many processes as possible. They have been used to provide predictions at a regional scale. While the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand, AOGCMs may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself.

===Grid===
The fluid equations for AGCMs are made discrete using either the [[finite difference method]] or the [[spectral method]]. For finite differences, a grid is imposed on the atmosphere. The simplest grid uses constant angular grid spacing (i.e., a latitude / longitude grid). However, non-rectangular grids (e.g., icosahedral) and grids of variable resolution&lt;ref&gt;C.

[[HadGEM1]] (and other ocean models) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the [[El Niño|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). Spectral models generally use a [[gaussian grid]], because of the mathematics of transformation between spectral and grid-point space. Typical AGCM resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude: HadCM3, for example, uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude, giving a grid of 96 by 73 points (96 x 72 for some variables); and has 19 vertical levels. This results in approximately 500,000 "basic" variables, since each grid point has four variables ([[Wind speed|''u'',''v'']], [[Temperature|''T'']], [[Humidity|''Q'']]), though a full count would give more (clouds; soil levels). HadGEM1 uses a grid of 1.875 degrees in longitude and 1.25 in latitude in the atmosphere; HiGEM, a high-resolution variant, uses 1.25 x 0.83 degrees respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For a standard finite difference model, uniform gridlines converge towards the poles. This would lead to computational instabilities (see [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]]) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles. Ocean models suffer from this problem too, unless a rotated grid is used in which the North Pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass. Spectral models do not suffer from this problem. Some experiments use [[geodesic grid]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] [[cube]] such that it covers the surface of a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gridding the sphere|url=http://mitgcm.org/projects/cubedsphere/|work=MIT GCM|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flux buffering===
Some early versions of AOGCMs required an ''ad hoc'' process of "flux correction" to achieve a stable climate. This resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce. Such a model failed to match observations. However, if the fluxes were 'corrected', the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised, which could affect model sensitivity. As a result, the vast majority of models used in the current round of IPCC reports do not use them. The model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary include improved ocean physics, improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean, and more physically consistent coupling between atmosphere and ocean submodels. Improved models now maintain stable, multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Third Assessment Report - Climate Change 2001 - Complete online versions|url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/309.htm|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112230927/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F309.htm|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convection===
Moist convection releases latent heat and is important to the Earth's energy budget. Convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models, and hence it must be handled via parameters. This has been done since the 1950s. Akio Arakawa did much of the early work, and variants of his scheme are still used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/arakawa.htm |title=Arakawa's Computation Device |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a variety of different schemes are now in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grads.iges.org/reps/rep27/colarep27.html |title=COLA Report 27 |publisher=Grads.iges.org |date=1996-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206085956/http://grads.iges.org/reps/rep27/colarep27.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/amip/10Tbl2.10.html |title=Table 2-10 |publisher=Pcmdi.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainbow.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/cmip/table4.html |title=Table of Rudimentary CMIP Model Features |publisher=Rainbow.llnl.gov |date=2004-12-02 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds are also typically handled with a parameter, for a similar lack of scale. Limited understanding of clouds has limited the success of this strategy, but not due to some inherent shortcoming of the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of the Atmosphere |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Most models include software to diagnose a wide range of variables for comparison with observations or [[process study|study of atmospheric processes]]. An example is the 2-metre temperature, which is the standard height for near-surface observations of air temperature. This temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures. Other software is used for creating plots and animations.

Coupled AOGCMs use [[transient climate simulation]]s to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios. These can be idealised scenarios (most commonly, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increasing at 1%/yr) or based on recent history (usually the "IS92a" or more recently the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] scenarios). Which scenarios are most realistic remains uncertain.

The 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] F [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212120/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig9-3.htm igure 9.3] shows the global mean response of 19 different coupled models to an idealised experiment in which emissions increased at 1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/348.htm#fig93 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141613/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/348.htm#fig93 |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170118/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig9-5.htm Figure 9.5] shows the response of a smaller number of models to more recent trends. For the 7 climate models shown there, the temperature change to 2100 varies from 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C with a median of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C.

Future scenarios do not include unknown events{{snd}} for example, volcanic eruptions or changes in solar forcing. These effects are believed to be small in comparison to [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) forcing in the long term, but large volcanic eruptions, for example, can exert a substantial temporary cooling effect.

Human GHG emissions are a model input, although it is possible to include an economic/technological submodel to provide these as well. Atmospheric GHG levels are usually supplied as an input, though it is possible to include a carbon cycle model that reflects vegetation and oceanic processes to calculate such levels.

For the six SRES marker scenarios, IPCC (2007:7–8) gave a "best estimate" of global mean temperature increase (2090–2099 relative to the period 1980–1999) of 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C to 4.0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ar4 spm projections"/&gt; Over the same time period, the "likely" range (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ar4 spm projections"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a scenario where global emissions start to decrease by 2010 and then declined at a sustained rate of 3% per year, the likely global average temperature increase was predicted to be 1.7&amp;nbsp;°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, rising to around 2&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100. In a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions, the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100. A rise as high as 7&amp;nbsp;°C was thought possible, although less likely.

Another no-reduction scenario resulted in a median warming over land (2090–99 relative to the period 1980–99) of 5.1&amp;nbsp;°C. Under the same emissions scenario but with a different model, the predicted median warming was 4.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

AOGCMs internalise as many processes as are sufficiently understood. However, they are still under development and significant uncertainties remain. They may be coupled to models of other processes, such as the [[carbon cycle]], so as to better model feedbacks. Most recent simulations show "plausible" agreement with the measured temperature anomalies over the past 150 years, when driven by observed changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. Agreement improves by including both natural and anthropogenic forcings.&lt;ref name='f4'&gt;IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/005.htm Summary for Policy Makers]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307220102/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/005.htm |date=7 March 2016 }}, [http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/figspm-4.htm  Figure 4]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094407/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2Ffigspm-4.htm |date=21 October 2016 }}, in {{citation

Climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system. Thousands of papers have been published about model-based studies. Part of this research is to improve the models.

In 2000, a comparison between measurements and dozens of GCM simulations of [[ENSO]]-driven tropical precipitation, water vapor, temperature, and outgoing longwave radiation found similarity between measurements and simulation of most factors. However the simulated change in precipitation was about one-fourth less than what was observed. Errors in simulated precipitation imply errors in other processes, such as errors in the evaporation rate that provides moisture to create precipitation. The other possibility is that the satellite-based measurements are in error. Either indicates progress is required in order to monitor and predict such changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0442(2000)013%3C0538:TSOTTH%3E2.0.CO%3B2 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The model mean exhibits good agreement with observations.
* The individual models often exhibit worse agreement with observations.
* Many of the non-flux adjusted models suffered from unrealistic climate drift up to about 1&amp;nbsp;°C/century in global mean surface temperature.
* The errors in model-mean surface air temperature rarely exceed 1&amp;nbsp;°C over the oceans and 5&amp;nbsp;°C over the continents; precipitation and sea level pressure errors are relatively greater but the magnitudes and patterns of these quantities are recognisably similar to observations.
* Surface air temperature is particularly well simulated, with nearly all models closely matching the observed magnitude of variance and exhibiting a correlation &gt; 0.95 with the observations.
* Simulated variance of sea level pressure and precipitation is within ±25% of observed.
* All models have shortcomings in their simulations of the present day climate of the stratosphere, which might limit the accuracy of predictions of future climate change.
** There is a tendency for the models to show a global mean cold bias at all levels.
** There is a large scatter in the tropical temperatures.
** The [[polar night jet]]s in most models are inclined poleward with height, in noticeable contrast to an equatorward inclination of the observed jet.
** There is a differing degree of separation in the models between the winter [[sub-tropical jet]] and the polar night jet.
* For nearly all models the r.m.s. error in zonal- and annual-mean surface air temperature is small compared with its natural variability.
** There are problems in simulating natural seasonal variability. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} [http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2000/CoveyAbeOuchi.html ( 2000)]
*** In flux-adjusted models, seasonal variations are simulated to within 2 [[kelvin|K]] of observed values over the oceans. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models shows errors up to about 6 K in extensive ocean areas.
*** Near-surface land temperature errors are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted models, which systematically underestimates (by about 5 K) temperature in areas of elevated terrain. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models forms a similar error pattern (with somewhat increased amplitude) over land.
*** In Southern Ocean mid-latitudes, the non-flux-adjusted models overestimate the magnitude of January-minus-July temperature differences by ~5 K due to an overestimate of summer (January) near-surface temperature. This error is common to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted models.
*** Over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land areas, zonal mean differences between July and January temperatures simulated by the non-flux-adjusted models show a greater spread (positive and negative) about observed values than results from the flux-adjusted models.
*** The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate a reasonable seasonal cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in their prediction of long-term climatic changes (such as global warming), but it is not a sufficient condition unless the seasonal cycle and long-term changes involve similar climatic processes.
* Coupled climate models do not simulate with reasonable accuracy clouds and some related hydrological processes (in particular those involving upper tropospheric humidity). Problems in the simulation of clouds and upper tropospheric humidity, remain worrisome because the associated processes account for most of the uncertainty in climate model simulations of anthropogenic change.

==Relation to weather forecasting==
The global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to (and often share computer code with) [[numerical weather prediction|numerical models for weather prediction]], but are nonetheless logically distinct.

Most [[weather forecasting]] is done on the basis of interpreting numerical model results. Since forecasts are short{{snd}} typically a few days or a week{{snd}} such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed SSTs. They also require accurate initial conditions to begin the forecast{{snd}} typically these are taken from the output of a previous forecast, blended with observations. Predictions must require only a few hours; but because they only cover a one-week the models can be run at higher resolution than in climate mode. Currently the [[ECMWF]] runs at {{convert|9|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/index_forecasts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503014123/http://www.ecmwf.int/index_forecasts.html |archivedate=3 May 2008 |df= }} [http://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16299-newsletter-no147-spring-2016.pdf ECMWF-Newsletter spring 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the {{convert|100|to|200|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} scale used by typical climate model runs. Often local models are run using global model results for boundary conditions, to achieve higher local resolution: for example, the [[Met Office]] runs a mesoscale model with an {{convert|11|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} resolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20010210225524/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/nwp/numerical/operational/index.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; covering the UK, and various agencies in the US employ models such as the NGM and NAM models. Like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the [[Global Forecast System|GFS]], global climate models are often spectral models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/nwp_gcm.html |title=What are general circulation models (GCM)? |publisher=Das.uwyo.edu |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of grid models. Spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster, thus reducing run times.

==Computations==
Climate models use [[quantitative method]]s to simulate the interactions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], oceans, [[land surface]] and [[cryosphere|ice]].

All climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave [[electromagnetic radiation]], chiefly [[Visible spectrum|visible]] and short-wave (near) [[infrared]], as well as outgoing energy as long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a [[First law of thermodynamics|change in temperature]].

The most talked-about models of recent years relate temperature to [[exhaust gas|emission]]s of [[greenhouse gas]]es. These models project an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record]], as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Meehl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10.html Climate Change 2007 Chapter 10: Global Climate Projections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415020743/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10.html |date=15 April 2016 }},{{Page needed|date=December 2011}} in {{Citation

Three (or more properly, four since time is also considered) dimensional GCM's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. They also contain parametrisations for processes such as convection that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose [[sea surface temperature]]s as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[EdGCM]], [[GFDL CM2.X]], ARPEGE-Climat&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article202  ARPEGE-Climat homepage, Version 5.1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104172118/http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article202 |date=4 January 2016 }}, 3 Sep 2009.

Retrieved 1 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the two models.

Models range in complexity:

* A simple [[radiant heat]] transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* Finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.
* Box models treat flows across and within ocean basins.

Other submodels can be interlinked, such as [[land use]], allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and ecosystems.

'''Giants' tomb''' (Italian: ''[[:wiktionary:Tomba|Tomba]] dei giganti'', [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: ''Tumba de zigantes'' / ''gigantis'') is the name given by [[Sardinians|local people]] and [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[Sardinia]]n [[megalithic]] [[gallery grave]] built during the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Nuragic civilization]]. They were collective tombs and can be found throughout [[Sardinia]], with 800 being discovered there.&lt;ref name=Atzeni.I&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2572124/ASPETTI_E_PROBLEMATICHE_DEL_RITUALE_FUNERARIO_DI_ETA_NURAGICA  Aspetti e problematiche del rituale funarario di età nuragica]&lt;/ref&gt;

A stone [[cairn]] lies over the burial chambers, with some examples having a cup-shaped entrance similar to the [[court cairn]] tombs of [[Ireland]].

==Types==
[[File:Giants' grave Coddu Vecchiu (Sardegna).jpg|right|500px|thumb|Coddu Vecchju - [[Arzachena]]]]

There are two general types of giants' tomb. In the so-called "slab type", uncut slabs are buried on end in the ground, and are arranged side-by-side. There is usually a central [[stele]], which is the largest slab (up to 4&amp;nbsp;m in height) and has a doorway cut through it.

In the more primitive slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is unmodified aside from the entrance that is cut through it at the base, or else there is a crude dolmen-like arrangement of 3 uncut rocks to form the entrance (Osono, Sortali, Lolghi, Pescaredda). In more advanced slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is modified so as to be rounded on top, and has a simple design carved into the front surface (Dorgali, Goronna, Santu Bainzu, Coddu Vecchju).

The [[sepulchre]]s have a characteristic rectangular plan with an [[apse]]. The burial chamber is usually 5 to 15 metres long and 1 to 2 metres high. The structures were originally covered by a mound resembling the shape of an overturned ship. Near the entrance an [[obelisk]] (''betile'' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]) is usually found, which symbolizes the gods or ancestors who watched over the dead.

The so-called "block type" tombs are made of rectangular-cut blocks (Bidistili, Madau II, Seleni II, Iloi, Mura Cuata).

There are also structures similar to the block-type giants tombs on the island of [[Malta]], in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/scotland/arran/ancient-sites/giants-graves.html Giant's Graves]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Menorca]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Lilliu, La civiltà nuragica, Sassari 1982 p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==
[[Image:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Replica catapult at [[Château des Baux]], [[France]]]]
While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==
{{see also|Technology during World War I}}
[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.  ''Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and "Nation-Building" in the Kennedy Era''.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.
For Project Camelot, see: Solovey, Mark.  "Project Camelot and the 1960s Epistemological Revolution: Rethinking the Politics-Patronage-Social Science Nexus," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 171-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''i-Tree''' is a collection of urban and rural [[forestry]] analysis and benefits assessment tools.  It was designed and developed by the [[United States Forest Service]] to quantify and value [[ecosystem services]] provided by trees including pollution removal, [[carbon sequestration]], avoided [[carbon emissions]], avoided [[stormwater runoff]], and more. i-Tree provides baseline data so that the growth of trees can be followed over time, and is used for planning purposes. Different tools within the i-Tree Suite use different types of inputs and provide different kinds of reports; some tools use a 'bottom up' approach based on tree inventories on the ground, while other tools use a 'top down' approach based on [[remote sensing]] data. i-Tree is peer-reviewed and has a process of ongoing collaboration to improve it.

There are seven different i-Tree applications which can enhance an individual's or organization's understanding of the benefits which trees provide in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many years the U.S. Forest Service has developed and refined these different applications: i-Tree Eco, i-Tree Landscape, i-Tree Hydro, i-Tree Design, i-Tree Canopy, i-Tree Species, i-Tree MyTree, i-Tree Streets, and i-Tree Vue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

i-Tree began in 2002 as survey of a sample of urban forest to simulate taking a [[tree inventory]] of an entire urban forest.  It then added hand held devices for efficient inventory of street trees.  The current version of i-Tree includes different tools which allow for several sources of data to be used, such as National Land Cover Data, Google Maps, and tree inventories. Some tools use continuous data on air pollution and meteorology for more accurate results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">{{hatnote|This article deals with the general meaning of the '''integument'''. Consult articles listed below for other articles dealing with similar or related concepts}}

In biology, '''integument''' is the natural covering of an organism or an organ, such as its [[skin]], [[husk]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"/&gt;

It derives from ''integumentum'', which means "a covering" in [[Latin]]. In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a [[cloak]] or a [[disguise]].&lt;ref name="Latin Cassel"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marchant, J.R.V. |author2=Charles Joseph F. | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1952 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English "integument" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of "clad" or "coated", as with a skin or husk.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical usage ==
In [[botany]] the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the [[Ovule#Integuments, chivai and chalaza|ovule]]. The integument may consist of one layer (or unitegmic) or two layers (or bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or [[seed]] coat.

==Zoological usage==
The integument of an organ in [[zoology]] typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the [[integumentary system]], where "integumentary" is a simile for "[[Skin|cutaneous]]".

In arthropods, the integument, or external "skin", consists of a single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[ectoderm]] from which arises the [[cuticle]],&lt;ref name="Kristensen&amp;Georges2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outer covering of [[chitin]] the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

==Derivative terms and sundry usages==
Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, "peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion"&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;) and integumented (as opposed to bare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-550-13202-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:
*[[Connective tissue in skeletal muscle]]
*[[Dorsal artery of the penis]] (example of integument enclosing an internal organ)
*[[Flensing]]
*[[Flesh]] (generic use of plural "integuments")
*[[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] (figurative usage)
*[[Integumentary system]] (senses related to vertebrate skin and medical aspects)

'''Leo Morandi''' (14 September 1923 &amp;ndash; 2 May 2009) was a promoter of the new post-[[World War II]] commercial [[ceramic]]s industry of [[Sassuolo]], Italy. At first he collaborated with local ceramic producers ([[Marazzi Group]]) and with Industries D'Agostino in [[Salerno]], [[Italy]]. In 1954, after selling an innovative [[patent]] to Ceramiche Marazzi ([[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]] selection unit), he was able to initiate startup of his own equipment supply business. Leo Morandi's innovations, knowledge, and experience aided growth and advancement throughout the [[Sassuolo]] ceramic companies, which in the 1960s constituted the worldwide known ''Sassuolo tile district''.

==Impact on industry==
In particular, he used two [[electrodes]] to select the biscuit; the passage of electricity through the material showed that it was not suitable for the successive glazing.

The production chain for ceramic tiles was then mainly handcrafted and labour-intensive, but Leo Morandi's inventions started the successful automation of various units. After the initial years he was able to open a distinct efficient production unit. Morandi was a reserved man and did not like publicity. He involved his workers and customers in the improvement of his inventions and innovations.
[[File:Fiera di Modena 1959.jpg|200px|left]]
Ceramic industry equipment examples include: automated floor tile edge glaze remover, automated packaging (floor tiles where historically bound with thin iron wire, before shipment), specialized [[silk]] screen machines, the peristaltic [[pump]], the transport line, the [[hydraulic press]], [[tile]] overturning mechanism, press reception unit, and glazing applications done with disk booths. These basic tile processing elements are still in use.

Leo Morandi began exporting these proven automated Italian [[ceramic]] industry innovations to [[Spain]], allowing advancement of two primary ceramic industry clusters.

[[File:The first Apollo 11 sample return container is unloaded.jpg|thumb|First samples from the Moon being delivered to LRL in 1969]]

The '''Lunar Receiving Laboratory''' ('''LRL''') was a facility at [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (Building 37) that was constructed to [[quarantine]] [[astronauts]] and material brought back from the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo program]] to mitigate the risk of [[back-contamination]]. After recovery at sea, crews from [[Apollo 11]],  [[Apollo 12]] and  [[Apollo 14]] walked from their [[helicopter]] to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] on the deck of an [[aircraft carrier]] and were brought to the LRL for quarantine. Samples of rock and [[regolith]] that the astronauts collected and brought back were flown directly to the LRL and initially analyzed in [[glovebox]] [[vacuum chamber]]s.

:::[[File:NASA-Houston LRL-installation.png]]

The quarantine requirement was dropped beginning with [[Apollo 15]] and the LRL was used for study, distribution and safe storage of the lunar samples. Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo space flight missions brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust from the lunar surface. The six space flights returned 2200 separate samples from six different exploration sites on the lunar surface.  (Other lunar samples were returned to Earth by three automated Soviet spacecraft, named [[Luna 16]], [[Luna 20]], and [[Luna 24]], which returned samples totaling 300&amp;nbsp;grams (approximately 3/4 pound) from three other lunar sites.)

In 1976, a portion of the samples were moved to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] for second-site storage. In 1979, a [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] was built to serve as the chief repository for the Apollo samples. It was constructed to provide permanent storage of the lunar sample collection in a physically secure and non-contaminating environment. The facility consists of storage vaults for the samples, laboratories for sample preparation and study, a vault for sample data and records, and machinery to supply nitrogen to the cabinets in which the samples are stored and processed. [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lun-fac.cfm] The Lunar Receiving Laboratory building is currently occupied by the Life Sciences division. It contains biomedical and environment labs, and is used for experiments involving human adaptation to [[microgravity]].

'''Mass communication''' is the study of how people exchange  their information through [[mass media]] to large segments of the population at the same time with an amazing speed. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood for relating  [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], and [[book]] publishing, as well as [[radio]], [[television]] and [[film]], even via [[internet]] as these mediums are used for disseminating information, [[news]] and [[advertising]].  Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] or [[organizational communication]], in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers.  The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], [[attitude (psychologist)|the attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the person or people receiving the information.

Definition of mass communication։

Normally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called Mass Communication. But in complete sense, mass communication can be defined as the process through which a message is circulated extensively among people nearby &amp; also throughout far extending areas such as entire countries or the globe.

What is Mass Communication?
* Mass communication is the process of transmitting messages to a large number of scattered audiences .... 

* Through mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to a large number of people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is being done through many mediums, such as radio, television, social networking, billboards, and newspapers.

==Field of study==
Mass communication is "the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2009, p. 624&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is regularly associated with [[media influence]] or media effects, and [[media studies]].  Mass communication is a branch of [[social science]] and a subfield of [[communication studies]] or [[communication]].

The [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]].  Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers.  Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].

In the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]] ([[Print media]]), [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]].  With the diversification of media options, the study of communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.  While the field of mass communication is continually evolving, the following four fields are generally considered the major areas of study within mass communication.  They exist in different forms and configurations at different schools or universities, but are (in some form) practiced at most institutions that study mass communication. '''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, refers to [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service.  Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of goods, services or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|title=What is Advertising?|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics or Features of Mass Communication
Mass Communication has all the features of general communication. In addition, it offers some unique characteristics because of its specialty in nature. 

Large Number of Audience

The foremost feature of mass communication is that it has large number of audience. No other communication gets as many receivers as it gets.
Heterogeneous Audience
Mass Communication is not only composed of a large number of audiences but also aims to heterogeneous audience. The heterogeneity here means that the audience may belong to different races, groups, section, cultures etc.
Scattered Audience
The audiences of Mass Communication are not organized in a certain area rather they are highly scattered in different geographical areas. The receivers of message of mass communication may stay any place of the country and even any place of the world.



Wide Area
The area of Mass Communication is wider than any other communication systems. In case of mass communication system, the message is structured, formal and standardized and that’s why it has acceptance all over the world.
Use of Channel
Mass Communication system uses various types of mass media channels such as-radio, television, newspapers, magazines etc.
Use of Common Message
Another unique characteristic of mass communication is that it sends the same message simultaneously to a large number of audiences staying far away from each other. If the audiences have the proper access to the media used by the sender they can easily get message wherever they stay in the world.
No Direct Feedback
Mass Communication does not produce any direct feedback. The reaction of audience cannot be known quickly here.
Outward Flow
The flow of message in mass communication is outward, not inward. The basic objective of mass communication is also to send message to the people outside the organization who say far away.
Use of Technology
Mass Communication system uses modern technology in the process of production and dissemination of the message to be sent.

===Journalism===
{{Main|Journalism}}
'''Journalism''', is the collection, verification, presentation, and editing of news for presentation through the media, in this sense, refers to the study of the product and production of [[news]].  The study of journalism involves looking at how news is produced, and how it is disseminated to the public through [[mass media]] outlets such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]]. The information provided pertains to current events, trends, issues, and people.

===Public relations===
{{Main|Public relations}}
'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]].  Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|title=What is Advertising?|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Communication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. [[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.

*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., &amp; Signorielli, N. (1986). "Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process" in J. Bryant &amp; D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17–40) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].
*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public "not what to think, but what to think about."  Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast.  This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "The Humanism of Media Ecology". Retrieved 9 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996). The medium is the massage: an inventory of effects. San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be “read” or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as “texts.” In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of study==

Communication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes.  Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication.  The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message.  Several prominent methods of study are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions.  To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.
*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.
*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script.  This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.
*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.

==Professional organizations==

The [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations.  Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">The '''{{Lang|de|Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis}}''' (MWV) (German for '''Mendelssohn Work Index''') is the first modern fully researched [[Catalogues of classical compositions#Comprehensive catalogues|music catalogue]] of the works of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. It appeared in 2009 under the auspices of the [[Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (SAW) under the leadership of the German music scholar Ralf Wehner, and is published by the firm of [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] as part of the "Leipzig Edition of the Works of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy".&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (2009), pp. 77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelssohn himself only allocated [[opus number]]s up to 72 for his published works, with further numbers up to 121 being added posthumously. Moreover, none of Mendelssohn's earlier works including his 12 [[String symphonies (Mendelssohn)|string symphonies]] or his operas, had any defined opus numbers. The MWV "conflates the known works into 26 groups and assigns a distinct MWV number to each of the works. Within each group, the works are ordered chronologically."&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''minimum intelligent signal test''', or '''MIST''', is a variation of the [[Turing test]] proposed by [[Chris McKinstry]] in which only [[Wiktionary:boolean|boolean]] (yes/no or true/false) answers may be given to questions.  The purpose of such a test is to provide a quantitative statistical measure of ''humanness'', which may subsequently be used to optimize the performance of [[artificial intelligence]] systems intended to imitate human responses.

McKinstry gathered approximately 80,000 propositions that could be answered yes or no, e.g.:

* Is Earth a planet?
* Was Abraham Lincoln once President of the United States?
* Is the sun bigger than my foot?
* Do people sometimes lie?

He called these propositions [[Mindpixel]]s.

These questions test both specific knowledge of aspects of culture, and basic facts about the meaning of various words and concepts. It could therefore be compared with the [[SAT]], [[intelligence test]]ing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program could be considered intelligent at all.

According to McKinstry, a program able to do much better than chance on a large number of MIST questions would be judged to have some level of intelligence and understanding. For example, on a 20-question test, if a program were guessing the answers at random, it could be expected to score 10 correct on average. But the [[probability]] of a program scoring 20 out of 20 correct by guesswork is only one in 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. one in 1,048,576; so if a program were able to sustain this level of performance over several independent trials, with no prior access to the propositions, it should be considered intelligent.

==Discussion==

McKinstry criticized existing approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] such as [[chatterbot]]s, saying that his questions could "kill" AI programs by quickly exposing their weaknesses. He contrasted his approach, a series of direct questions assessing an AI's capabilities, to the Turing test and [[Loebner Prize]] method of engaging an AI in undirected typed conversation.

Critics{{who|date=May 2013}} of the MIST have noted that it would be easy to "kill" a McKinstry-style AI too, due to the impossibility of supplying it with correct answers to all possible yes/no questions by ways of a finite set of human-generated Mindpixels: the fact that an AI can answer the question "Is the sun bigger than my foot?" correctly does not mean that it can answer variations like "Is the sun bigger than (my hand | my liver | an egg yolk | Alpha Centauri A | ...)" correctly, too.

However, the late McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, knowledgeable entity (on a par with humans) would be able to work out answers such as (yes | yes | yes | don't know | ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named. In other words, the MIST was intended as a test of AI, not as a suggestion for implementing AI.

It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator's gullibility than of the machine's intelligence. According to this argument, a human's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the [[ELIZA effect]], a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, [[anthropomorph]]izing the program. The response, suggested by [[Alan Turing]]'s essay "Can Machines Think?", is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent. The dispute is thus over what it means for a program to have "real" intelligence, and by what signs it can be detected.

A similar debate exists in the controversy over [[Great Ape language]], in which nonhuman primates are said to have learned some aspects of sign languages but the significance of this learning is disputed.

'''Null fill''' is used in [[radio]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] systems which are located on [[mountain]]s or tall [[tower]]s, to prevent too much of the [[Signalling (telecommunications)|signal]] from overshooting the nearest part of intended coverage area.  [[phase shifting|Phasing]] is used between antenna elements to take [[electrical power|power]] away from the [[main lobe]] and electrically direct more of it at a more downward angle in the [[vertical plane]]. This requires a [[phased array]]. Changing the relative power supplied to each element also changes the [[radiation pattern]] in this manner, and often both methods are used in combination.

== Historical overview ==

===Origins===
The [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted thinkers, such as [[Karl Marx]] with his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. (1967/1845). The German ideology. In L.D. Easton &amp; K.H.L. Guddat (Eds. and Trans.), ''Writings of the young Marx on philosophy and society''.

(1933) ''The human problems of an industrial civilization''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses. About the time Taylorism arose, [[James Hartness|Hartness]] reconsidered worker-machine interaction and its impact on worker psychology.&lt;ref name=Hartness1912&gt;{{Citation |last=Hartness |first=James |title=The human factor in works management |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1912 |location=New York and London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB41AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=1065709 |postscript=. Republished by Hive Publishing Company as Hive management history series no. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-87960-047-1}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation in 1948 of the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]] (ISR) at the [[History of the University of Michigan#Later 20th century .E2.80.94 Increasing student activism|University of Michigan]] was important because of its research on [[occupational stress]] and employee health.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, R.P. et al. (1971). ''Survey of working conditions: Final report on univariate and bivariate tables, Document No. 2916-0001''. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House, J.S.

Alienation and mental health in the modern industrial environment. In L. Levi (Ed.), ''Society, stress and disease'' (Vol. 1, pp. 148–180). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the impact of unemployment on mental health was conducted at the University of Sheffield’s Institute of Work Psychology.&lt;ref name = "Christie"/&gt; In 1970 Kasl and Cobb documented the impact of unemployment on blood pressure in U.S. factory workers.&lt;ref name="Kasl and Cobb"&gt;Kasl, S.V., &amp; Cobb, S.

===Recognition as a field of study===
A number of individuals are associated with the creation of the term “occupational health psychology” or "occupational health psychologist."&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2018). Occupational health psychology. In D.S. Dunn (Ed.), ''Oxford Bibliographies in Psychology''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They include Ferguson (1977),&lt;ref name = "Ferguson 1977"&gt;Ferguson, D. (1977). The psychologist and occupational health. ''Proceedings of the Annual Conference, Ergonomics Society of Australia and New Zealand'' (pp. 41–50).

New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Everly (1986),&lt;ref name="Everly 1986"/&gt; and Raymond, Wood, and Patrick (1990).&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"&gt;Raymond, J.S., Wood, D., &amp; Patrick, W.K.

''American Psychologist, 45'', 1159–1161. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.45.10.1159&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of stress-related worker compensation claims in the U.S., the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) "recognized stress-related psychological disorders as a leading occupational health risk" (p.&amp;nbsp;201).&lt;ref name="sauter1999"&gt;Sauter, S.L., Hurrell, J.J., Jr., Fox, H.R., Tetrick, L.E., &amp; Barling, J. (1999). Occupational health psychology: An emerging discipline.

''Monitor on Psychology'', [[American Psychological Association]]. 33(2). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/milestones.aspx] Retrieved July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When this change was coupled with an increased recognition of the impact of stress on a range of problems in the workplace, NIOSH found that their stress-related programs were significantly increasing in  prominence.&lt;ref name="sauter1999" /&gt; In 1990, Raymond et al.&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"/&gt; argued that the time has come for doctoral-level psychologists to get interdisciplinary OHP training, integrating [[health psychology]] with [[public health]], because creating healthy workplaces should be a goal for the field.

===Emergence as a discipline===
Established in 1987, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' is the first and "longest established journal in the fast developing discipline that is occupational health psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"&gt;Cox, T., &amp; Tisserand, M. (2006). Editorial: Work &amp; Stress comes of age: Twenty years of occupational health psychology. ''Work &amp; Stress, 20'', 1–5. doi:10.1080/02678370600739795&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 21–34). Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' was published by APA. That same year, the [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors [http://www.icohweb.org/site/scientific-committee-detail.asp?sc=33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_scientific_committees.asp International Commission on Occupational Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which focused primarily on OHP.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; In 1999, the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"&gt;Houdmont, J. (2009). Across the pond: A history of the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology. ''Newsletter of the Society of Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That workshop is considered to be the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"/&gt;

In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; Also in 2000, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' became associated with the EA-OHP.&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"/&gt; In 2005, the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] (SOHP) was established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schonfeld, I.S.

== Research topics ==

===Important theoretical models in OHP research===

Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort-reward imbalance models.

==== Demand-control-support model ====
The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., [[job control (workplace)|autonomy and control over the job]]) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to "job strain," a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).&lt;ref name = "karasek 1979"&gt;Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 24''(2), 285–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., &amp; Bongers, P.M. (2003). "The very best of the millennium": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8'', 282–305. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.8.4.282&lt;/ref&gt; The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‘skill discretion’ and ‘decision authority’.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"&gt;Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., &amp; Hutchinson, A.D. (2015). Differential associations of job control components with both waist circumference and body mass index. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 143'', 1–8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.034&lt;/ref&gt; Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"&gt;de Araújo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 6'', Suppl. 52–59&lt;/ref&gt; Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"/&gt; These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joensuu, M. et al. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986–2005. ''American Journal of Epidemiology, 175'', 609–619. doi:10.1093/aje/kws028&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1989"&gt;Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., &amp; Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 15'', 271–279. doi:10.5271/sjweh.1852&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Job demands-resources model ====

An alternative model, the [[job demands-resources model|job demands-resources (JD-R) model]],&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., &amp; Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 86'', 499–512. doi:10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.499&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Effort-reward imbalance model====
After the DCS model, the, perhaps, second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J., &amp; Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. ''Work &amp; Stress, 8'', 130–140. doi: 10.1080/02678379408259985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 27–41. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.

=== Occupational stress and physical health ===
A number of work-related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

====Cardiovascular disease====
{{Main|Occupational stress|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has identified health-behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required  attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44''(2), 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt; These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

Fredikson, Sundin, and Frankenhaeuser (1985) found that reactions to psychological stressors include increased activity in the brain axes which play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Fredrikson M., Sundin O., &amp; Frankenhaeuser M. (1985). Cortisol excretion during the defence reaction in humans. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 47'', 313–319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeQuattro, V., &amp; Hamad, R. (1985).

(1998). Is the effect of job strain on myocardial infarction risk due to interaction between high psychological demands and low decision latitude? Results from Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP). ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 46''(11), 1405–1415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.V., &amp; Hall, E.M. (1988). Job strain, workplace social support, and cardiovascular disease: A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the Swedish working population. ''American Journal of Public Health, 78''(10), 1336–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 17 [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] having reasonably high [[internal validity]] found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low levels of decision latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Belkic, K.L., Landsbergis, P.A., Schnall, P.L., &amp; Baker, D. (2004). Is job strain a source of major cardiovascular risk? ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health, 30''(2), 85–128.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings, however, were clearer for men than for women, on whom data were more sparse. Fishta and Backé's&lt;ref&gt;Fishta, A., &amp; Backé, E. (2015). Psychosocial stress at work and cardiovascular diseases: An overview of systematic reviews. ''International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 88'',997–1014. doi:10.1007/s00420-015-1019-0.&lt;/ref&gt; review-of-reviews also links work-related psychosocial stress to elevated risk of CVD in men. In a massive (''n'' &gt; 197,000) longitudinal study that combined data from 13 independent studies, Kivimäki et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Kivimäki, M., Nyberg, S., Batty, G., Fransson, E., Heikkilä, K., Alfredsson, L., . . . Theorell, T. (2012). Job strain as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data. ''The Lancet, 380'', 1491–1497. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60994-5&lt;/ref&gt; found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women. Meta-analytic research also links job strain (the combination of high demands and low control) to stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Y., Xu, S., Hua, J. et al. (2015). Association between job strain and risk of incident stroke: A meta-analysis. ''Neurology, 85'', 1648–1654. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000002098&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that, consistent with the ERI model, high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related rewards adversely affects cardiovascular health. At least five studies of men have linked effort-reward imbalance with CVD.&lt;ref&gt;Landsbergis, P., et al. (2003).

==== Job-related burnout and cardiovascular health ====

=== Workplace mistreatment ===
{{Main|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}}

There are many forms of workplace mistreatment ranging from relatively minor discourtesies to serious cases of bullying and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Caughlin, D.E., Gazica, M.W., Truxillo, D.M., &amp; Spector, P.E. (2014). Workplace mistreatment climate and potential employee and organizational outcomes: A meta-analytic review from the target’s perspective.

====Workplace incivility====
{{Main|Incivility}}
[[Workplace incivility]] has been defined as "low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target....Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others" (p.&amp;nbsp;457).&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, L. M., &amp; Pearson, C. M. (1999). Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace. ''Academy of Management Review, 24'', 452–471. doi:10.5465/AMR.1999.2202131&lt;/ref&gt;  Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.&lt;ref name="cortina magley"&gt;Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., &amp; Langhout, R.D.  (2001). Incivility in the workplace: Incidence and impact. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 6'', 64–80. doi:10.1037//1076-8998.6.1.64&lt;/ref&gt; In research on more than 1000 U.S. civil service workers, more than 70% of the sample experienced workplace incivility in the past five years. Compared to men, women were more exposed to incivility; incivility was associated with psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="cortina magley" /&gt;

====Workplace bullying====
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of [[workplace bullying]] vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual by one or more others who have more power than the target.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P.E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 271–296). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. doi:10.1037/10893-011&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying is sometimes termed ''[[mobbing]]''.

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
[[Sexual harassment]] is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do the job.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K.M., &amp; Richman, J.A.

==== Workplace violence ====
{{Main|Workplace violence}}
Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

::-Nonfatal assault-
Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Prevalence of workplace aggression in the U.S. workforce. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J.  Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 47–89). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented [[assault]]s per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.&lt;ref&gt;Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39''(1), 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"/&gt; A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the [[health care]] sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault-related injury.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., &amp; Ducatman, A.M. (2003). Risk factors for physical assault. State managed workers' compensation experience. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 25''(1), 31–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another workers' compensation study found that excessively high rates of assault-related injury in schools, healthcare, and, to a lesser extent, banking.&lt;ref&gt;Hashemi, L., &amp; Webster, B.S. (1998). Non-fatal workplace violence workers' compensation claims (1993 1996). ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40'', 561–567. doi:10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00095-3&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the physical injury that results from being a victim of workplace violence, individuals who witness such violence without being directly [[victimized]] are at increased risk for experiencing adverse psychological effects, including high levels of distress and arousal, as found in a study of Los Angeles teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, A.M. (1978). Combat neurosis in inner-city schools. ''American Journal of Psychiatry, 135''(10), 1189–1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

::-Homicide-
In 1996 there were 927 work-associated homicides in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2004). ''1992–2001 Census of fatal occupational injuries (CFOI) Revised data.'' Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

=== Mental disorder ===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.

==== Alcohol abuse ====
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., &amp; Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations.  ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16'', 734–746. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb00670.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk.  A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incident]] cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., &amp; Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19'', 647–655. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb01562.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.

==== Depression ====
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-III'']] major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., &amp; Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. ''Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32''(11), 1079–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]], no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted.   Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). ''Psychological Medicine, 35'', 865–871. doi:10.1017/S0033291704003241&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review and [[meta-analysis]] links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T.,  Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. ''Psychological Medicine, 47'', 1342–135. doi:10.1017/S003329171600355X&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

==== Personality disorders ====
{{Main|Personality disorder}}
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as [[substance abuse]] and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz &amp; Rogers (Eds.), ''Work accommodation and retention in mental health'' (pp. 163–188). New York: Springer. doi:10.1007978-1-4419-0428-9_9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., &amp; French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. ''Industrial Relations, 50'', 149–173. doi:10.1111/j.1468-232X.2010.00629.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schizophrenia ====
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to “noisesome” work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., &amp; Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. ''American Sociological Review, 51'', 242–258. doi:10.2307/2095519&lt;/ref&gt; The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the [[Psychiatric epidemiology#Example: The Epidemiological Catchment Area Project|Epidemiologic Catchment Area]] (ECA) study.&lt;ref&gt;Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., &amp; Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. ''Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26'', 273–280. doi:10.1007/BF00789219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological distress ===
{{Main|Psychological distress}}
[[longitudinal study|Longitudinal studies]] have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., &amp; Strahan, S.R. (2014). How do occupational stressor-strain effects vary with time? A review and meta-analysis of the relevance of time lags in longitudinal studies. Work &amp; Stress, 28, 9–30. doi: 10.1080/02678373.2013.877096&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress refers to [[negative affect]], without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrenwend, B.P., Shrout, P.E., Egri, G., &amp; Mendelsohn, F.S.

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and [[anxiety]] symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. [[Job satisfaction]] is also related to negative health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, E.S., &amp; Grunberg, L. (1995). Work alienation and problem alcohol behavior.

==== Psychosocial working conditions====
Parkes (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, K.R. (1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 67'', 784–796. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.784&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this "[[natural experiment]]," student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 70'', 314–328. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.314&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Carayon, P. (1992).  A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, &amp; J.J.

''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75'', 33–58. doi:10.1348/096317902167630&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment ====
A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, K. I., &amp; Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74'', 264–282. doi:10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

==== Economic insecurity ====
Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.&lt;ref name="probst sears"&gt;Probst, T.M., &amp; Sears, L.E. (2009). Stress during the financial crisis. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5'', 3–4. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV5January2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"&gt;Sinclair, R.R., Probst, T., Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schaffer, M.M.

==== Work-family balance ====
{{Main|Work–family conflict|Double burden|Work–life balance}}

Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work–family conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"&gt;Greenhaus, J.G., &amp; Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 165–183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other.&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"/&gt;

=== Workplace interventions ===
A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, K. M., &amp; Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13'', 69–93. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.13.1.69&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

====Industrial organizations====
OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention,  an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30''(2), 129 137. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.129&lt;/ref&gt; The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.

Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., &amp; Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. ''Health Education Quarterly, 19''(1), 55–76. doi:10.1177/109019819201900105&lt;/ref&gt; The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and [[productivity]]. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.

====Modestly scaled interventions====
Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2'', 6–7. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The interventions tended reduce organization health-care costs.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"/&gt;

==== Health promotion ====

Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., &amp; Pelletier, K.R. (2011). An integral framework for organizational wellness: Core technology, practice models, and case studies In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 95–118). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, [[school violence#Prevention and intervention|education]], has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully "screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.L, &amp; Catano, V.M. (2006) Screening and selecting out violent employees. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 549–577). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that aggression-prevention training of existing employees may be an alternative to screening. Only a small number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training programs to reduce workplace violence currently exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Training as a workplace aggression intervention strategy. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 579–605). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total Worker Health™====
{{Main|Total Worker Health}}

Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,&lt;ref name = "Schill"&gt;Schill, A. L., &amp; Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health™ program: An overview. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55''(12 Suppl.), S8–S11. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000000037&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by [[NIOSH]]. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit.&lt;ref name = "Schill"/&gt; Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;Anger, W. K., Elliot, D. L., Bodner, T., Olson, R., Rohlman, D. S., Truxillo, D. M., &amp; ... Montgomery, D. (2015). Effectiveness of Total Worker Health interventions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 20'', 226–247. doi:10.1037/a0038340&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and safety===
{{Main|Work accident}}

Psychological factors are an important factor in [[occupational accident]]s that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's [[safety climate]] that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. ''Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42'', 1517–1522. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2009.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Online patient education''', also known as '''online patient engagement''', is a method of providing medical information and education to patients using [[learning management systems]] delivered through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of bariatric Centers of Excellence Web sites for functionality and efficacy. Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;4(5):571-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of computer-based instruction and includes web seminars, downloadable materials, interactive learning courses, and audio/visual presentations. Generally, online patient education is supplemented with in-person consultations tailored to each individual.

==General usage==
Health professionals use online patient education to prepare patients for medical procedures, administer intake and informed consent paperwork, educate patients about health conditions, provide information about preventive care, encourage healthy behavior and lifestyle changes, etc. Health insurance companies use online patient education to inform patients about coverage policies. 

Online patient education is gaining popularity as home Internet access becomes more common and medical practices increasingly utilize digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in patient education Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 203-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers in Patient Education. Comput Inform Nurs 21(2):88-96, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Patients either view online patient education programs and materials in a medical office or from their homes or other remote locations with Internet access. Content may include interactive features such as quizzes, live question and answer sessions (in moderated web seminars), and the ability to complete and submit forms.

==Patient education by type==

===On location===
Any education delivered verbally by a healthcare provider to a single patient or group of patients can be considered as On Location patient education. Although this is still the most commonly used patient education method it is time consuming, can have consistency problems, and relies heavily on the individual patient ability to absorb, understand, and retain the verbal information.

===Paper based===
The second most common method. Any information brochure at a healthcare provider office falls under this category. The benefits of printed materials is that patients can refer back to the information

===Web based===
Patient education that is made available by a healthcare provider via his/her website, specific portal, or EHR. Web based education can be provided in an [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] and [[Synchronous learning|Synchronous]] styles.

==Advantages==
Educating patients with online technology can be advantageous&lt;ref&gt;Online patient education: A superior alternative to in-person information seminars Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages S44-S45&lt;/ref&gt; for both medical practices and patients because it gives health care providers the opportunity to create comprehensive educational materials that are consistently presented, rather than relying on face-to-face meetings in which information is presented by a staff member.&lt;ref&gt;Patients Postoperatively Forget Aspects of Preoperative Patient Education. Obesity Surgery, 15, 2005 1066-1069&lt;/ref&gt; Patients need not possess advanced computer/web skills to use this method of learning. A survey of 3200 patients revealed that even patients who are not computer literate are satisfied with online patient education as means of learning about medical care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12962">'''Onomasiology''' (from {{lang-el|ὀνομάζω}} (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "how do you express X?" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of [[lexicology]], the study of words (although some apply the term also to [[grammar]] and conversation). 

Onomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior&lt;ref&gt;OED: "The study of language which deals with the identification of a preconceived
meaning or concept by name or names"&lt;/ref&gt;
(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as [[semasiology]]: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" (answers: ''french fries'' in the US, ''chips'' in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., "what is the meaning of the term ''chips''?" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).

Onomasiology can be carried out [[wikt:synchronic|synchronically]] or [[wikt:diachronic|diachronically]], i.e. historically.

==Definition==

Onomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in [[Romance languages]]. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and [[Hugo Schuchardt]] started the "[[Wörter und Sachen]]" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the "dame phonétique" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the "dame sémantique" (justify semantic changes).

Another branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable [[linguistic atlas]]es. The first ones are ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, the ALF (''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'') by [[Jules Gilliéron]] (1902–1920), the AIS (''Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'') by [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]] (1928–1940), the DSA (''Deutscher Sprachatlas'') by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by [[Hans Kurath]], the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).

In 1931 the German linguist [[Jost Trier]] introduced a new method in his book ''Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes'' which is known as the [[lexical field theory]]. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by [[Cecil H. Brown]], [[Stanley R. Witkowski]], [[Brent Berlin]]). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of [[Dirk Geeraerts]], Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical ''Onomasiology Online'', which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by [[Joachim Grzega]], Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.

==Instruments for the historical onomasiologist==

The most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:
* the [[linguistic atlas]]
* the [[etymological dictionary]]
* the dialect dictionary
* [[thesaurus|thesauri]]
* diachronic [[text corpus|text corpora]]

==Lexical change==
===Explanations===

When a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.

The coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):
* difficulties in classifying the thing to be named or attributing the right word to the thing to be named, thus confusing designations
* fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world
* everyday contact situations
* institutionalized and non-institutionalized linguistic pre- and proscriptivism
* flattery
* insult
* disguising things (i.e. [[euphemism|euphemistic]] language, [[doublespeak]])
* taboo
* avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words
* abolition of forms that can be ambiguous in many contexts
* wordplay/puns
* excessive length of words
* morphological misinterpretation (creation of transparency by changes within a word = [[folk-etymology]])
* deletion of irregularity
* desire for plastic/illustrative/telling names for a thing
* natural prominence of a concept
* cultural-induced prominence of a concept
* changes in the world
* changes in the categorization of the world
* prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

The following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.

===Processes===

In the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected ["naming in a more abstract sense"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected ["naming in a more concrete sense"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.

If the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):

* adoption of either
# an already existing word of speaker's own language ([[semantic change]]) or (b)
# a word from a foreign language ([[loanword]])
* [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (e.g. ''to e-mail'' from the noun ''e-mail'')
* composition (in a broad sense, i.e. [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and derivations, which are, very consciously, not further subclassified)
* [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] (i.e. morpheme deletion, e.g. the noun ''daily'' from ''daily newspaper'')
* [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] (i.e. morpheme shortening, e.g. ''fan'' from ''fanatic'')
* [[acronym]]s (e.g. ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* [[Blend word|blend]]ings (including [[folk-etymology|folk-etymologies]], although these come up non-intentionally, e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* [[back-derivation]] (e.g. ''to baby-sit'' from ''babysitter'')
* [[reduplication]] (e.g. ''goody-goody'')
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] alteration (e.g. number change as in ''people'' as a plural word instead of a singular word)
* [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] compounds (e.g. ''peacock'' for original ''pea'', which already meant 'peacock')
* wordplaying/[[pun]]s
* stress alteration (e.g. stress shift in E. ''ímport'' vs. ''impórt'')
* graphic alteration (e.g. E. ''discrete'' vs. ''discreet'')
* [[Phraseology|phraseologism]]
* [[Root (linguistics)|root creation]] (including [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] and expressive words)

The name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.

In order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations ([[iconeme]]s) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:

*contiguity relations (= "neighbor-of" relations)
*similarity relations (= "similar-to" relations)
*partiality relations (= "part-of" relations)
*contrast relations (= "opposite-to" relations)
These relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. 

A complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):

* identity (e.g. with loans)
* "figurative", i.e. individually felt, similarity of the concepts (e.g. ''mouse'' for a computer device that looks '''like''' a mouse)
* contiguity of concepts (e.g. ''a Picasso'' for a painting '''by''' Picasso or ''glass'' for a container made '''out of''' glass)
* partiality of concepts (e.g. ''bar'' 'place of an inn where drinks are mixed' for the '''entire''' inn)
* contrast of concepts (e.g. ''bad'' in the sense of "good")
* "literal" or "figurative" similarity between the forms of a sign and the concept (e.g. with onomatopoetic words like ''purr'')
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. with generalization of meaning, e.g. ''Christmas tree'' for any kind of fir tree or even any kind of conifer)
* strong relation between contents of signs and contrast of concepts (e.g. with ''learn'' in the sense of "teach" in some English dialects)
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. ''corn'' in the English sense of "wheat" or Scottish sense of "oats" instead of "cereal")
* ("literal") similarity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* contiguity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''brunch'' from ''breakfast + lunch'', ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* "literal", i.e. objectively visible, similarity and contiguity of concepts (e.g. with the transfer of names among spruce and fir in many dialects)
* "literal" similarity of referents and strong relation between contents of signs
* multiple associations (e.g. with certain forms of word-play)

The concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.

'''Oyster reef restoration''' refers to the process of rebuilding or restoring of [[oyster reef]]s all over the globe. Over time, [[oyster]]s have been negatively affected by environmental change, such as harmful fishing techniques,&lt;ref name="Restoration Suitability"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=Jennifer Beseres|last2=Cleveland|first2=Andrew|last3=Palmer|first3=Terence A.|title=A Restoration Suitability Index Model for the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in the Mission-Aransas Estuary, TX, USA.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=July 2012|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1–11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0040839|pmid=22792410|pmc=3394728}}&lt;/ref&gt; over harvesting,&lt;ref name="Oyster Restoration Nekton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Laura A.|last2=Furlong|first2=Jessica N.|last3=Brown|first3=Kenneth M.|title=Oyster Reef Restoration in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: Effect of Artificial Substrate and Age on Nekton and Benthic Macroinvertebrate Assemblage Use|journal=Restoration Ecology|date=March 2014|volume=22|issue=2|pages=214–222|doi=10.1111/rec.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[water pollution]], and other factors. The results of these factors have been disease and ultimately, a large decline in the global population of oysters and the prevalence and sustainability of oyster reefs. Apart from the ecological importance of oyster reefs, [[oyster farming]] is an important industry, particularly in coastal areas. Both artificial materials and natural components have been used to rebuild the reefs in an attempt to regenerate the oyster population thus fostering the reformation of reefs.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration alternative substrates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Lindsey|last2=De Santiago|first2=Kevin|last3=Palmer|first3=Terence|title=Oyster reef restoration: effect of alternative substrates on oyster recruitment and nekton habitat use.|journal=Journal of Coastal Conservation |date=February 2015|volume=19|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1007/s11852-014-0351-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem and history ==
The first stage in an oyster’s life cycle is the free-swimming larval stage. After about three weeks, the larva attaches to a hard [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]—surface area to attach to—such as prop roots, dock pilings, natural rock, and other oysters becoming an oyster spat—oysters that have just settled to the bottom.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oysterrestoration.com/faq.html |title=Oyster Reef Restoration Project |publisher=Oysterrestoration.com |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of oysters often join together, thus forming an oyster reef (also referred to as oyster bed, oyster mat).&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/easternoyster/ |title=Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once attached to a surface, oysters will stay there for the remainder of their lives.

Oyster beds provide a number of ecological, economical and recreational benefits to the environment. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Eastern Oyster acts as a [[keystone species]] by filtering [[estuaries]] and maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems. In addition to being a keystone species, oysters also serve as an [[indicator species]]—they are used to gather information on the overall health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project" /&gt;

Since the early Americas, oyster beds have been beneficial for the North American Indians, who harvested oysters for subsistence purposes, and for the European colonists in the region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Since the 19th century oyster beds have been vital for commercial harvests and have generated substantial income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/Oyster_reef.htm |title=Oyster_reef |publisher=Sms.si.edu |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of oyster populations have greatly declined within the last century due to over-harvesting, dredging, increased sedimentation, invasive species, pollution and disease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/restoration/techniques/oysterrestoration.html |title=NOAA Habitat Conservation &amp;#124; Restoration Center &amp;#124; Restoration Techniques and Monitoring &amp;#124; Oyster Restoration |publisher=Habitat.noaa.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that more than 85% of oyster reefs are gone, making it the most threatened marine habitat in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Beck.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012527/http://www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Beck.pdf |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, this has spawned a need for oyster restoration projects in order to revitalize the depleted natural resource of the oyster population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; In response to this decline, many oyster restoration projects have been put into place throughout the southeastern United States. The projects develop a long-term strategy of sustained productivity for oyster reefs and restore the ecological role they provide to nearby reef habitats.&lt;ref name="carteret1"&gt;http://main2.carteret.edu/~kemps/files/Oyster%20Gardening%20Manual%20print.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="southalabama1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southalabama.edu/marinesciences/oysterproposal.doc | title=Marine Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The first step in oyster restoration is to determine the locations for potential reefs. This is often done by comprehensive surveys that measure salinity levels, water quality, previous existence of oyster reefs, substrate conditions, prevalence of diseases, tidal range, oxygen concentration, algae concentration, prevalence of predators, accessibility and security.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

Once the location is determined, cultch—fossilized shell, coral or other similar materials produced by living organisms designed to provide points of attachment for oysters&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;—is often obtained from sustainable recycling programs. Used oyster and clam shells from farmers and restaurants are collected and disinfected by volunteers to be used in oyster restoration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/OysterResearch/2768.asp |title=Oyster Restoration (OYR) |publisher=Fgcu.edu |date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once returned to the water, these recycled shells provide substrate for oyster larval eggs to begin populating oyster beds laid out by volunteers programs such as those implemented in Southwest Florida,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncfisheries.net/shellfish/recycle1.htm |title=NCDMF Oyster Sanctuaries |publisher=Ncfisheries.net |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aquanic.org/species/shellfish/documents/oysterrestoration.pdf |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026092221/http://aquanic.org/species/shellfish/documents/oysterrestoration.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saltwaterfishing.sc.gov/oyster.html |title=Saltwater Recreational Fishing License Program |publisher=Saltwaterfishing.sc.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shellfish.uga.edu/pdf/brochures/ga_program_07_proof2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Southern California, and Alabama.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://www.marsci.uga.edu/gaseagrant/pdf/MAREX%20BULLETIN%20VOL.%208%20Intertidal%20Growth.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025307/http://www.marsci.uga.edu/gaseagrant/pdf/MAREX%20BULLETIN%20VOL.%208%20Intertidal%20Growth.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common species of oysters used in oyster restoration is the Eastern American oyster ([[Crassostrea virginica]]),&lt;ref name="state1" /&gt; which is also called the American Oyster, Atlantic Oyster, Common Oyster, and Virginia Oyster.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

According to the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC), oysters in the southern part of the United States spawn when water temperatures are above 68 degrees.&lt;ref name="carteret1" /&gt; But they are affected more by the specific site where oyster restoration projects occur, the species of oysters used in a project, and if they are native to the surrounding area and disease free.&lt;ref name="nature1"&gt;[http://www.nature.org/files/lease_sub_lands.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200458/http://www.nature.org/files/lease_sub_lands.pdf |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly in the southeastern U.S., mangroves and other shoreline vegetation are often planted in conjunction with oyster restoration efforts to provide substrate – surface area to attach to – and reduce shoreline erosion resulting in less sediment deposits within estuaries.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

Oyster restoration in public waters often requires permits and licenses from various agencies with requirements varying from state to state. Most often permits typically involve the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], state natural resource agencies and state public health departments.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Goals ==
The typical desired outcomes of these restoration projects are the restoration of oyster reefs to produce a fully functioning, three-dimensional bed system that provides associated ecosystem services and biological functions, such as marine biodiversity, shoreline protection, sediment trapping, water quality improvement, and recreational fishing opportunities.

NOAA provides some of the major goals of an oyster restoration project:
* Augment commercial harvest
* Serve as habitat
* Improve water quality
* Increase or improve spat set in an area by creating oyster sanctuaries
* Maintain or increase biodiversity
* Restore ecological function
* Provide a barrier to prevent beach or shoreline erosion
* Protect and enhance sea grass restoration projects&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Environmental value ==
Intertidal oysters act as a keystone species by maintaining a healthy coastal ecosystem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marex.uga.edu/shellfish/oysterrest.html |title=G.E.O.R.G.I.A |publisher=Marex.uga.edu |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They filter the water and increase water clarity by extracting organic and inorganic particles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The filtration capacity of an average adult oyster is estimated to be 50 gallons per day.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oysterrecovery.org/Content/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=88 |title=Oyster Recovery Partnership: Shell Recycling Alliance |publisher=Oysterrecovery.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oysters not only clean the water, but also act as effective shoreline buffers&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; by dissipating the energy caused by boat wakes and waves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; Oyster reefs also support critical fisheries by providing habitat for numerous species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish.&lt;ref name="southalabama1"/&gt;

The ecological value of reusing oyster shells for oyster restoration projects is vital not only for producing zero waste, but also for diversifying and increasing the number of oyster beds in a given area.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/florida/misc/art26796.html#partners |title=Florida Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to environmental benefits, oyster restoration is also economically beneficial since coastal communities rely heavily on oysters for profit and subsistence.&lt;ref name="nature2"/&gt;

=== Environmental preventative issues ===
Some ancient reefs are used to make restorative oyster reefs in nearby sites. However, to reduce the risk of environmental damage when dredging, many projects tend to stay away from this method of transplanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseagrant.org/home/coastwatch/coastwatch-articles?task=showArticle&amp;id=519 |title=North Carolina Sea Grant – Coastwatch Articles |publisher=Ncseagrant.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue of environmental harm is placing invasive or newly introduced oyster species in an unknown habitat that can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt; Therefore, it is important to correctly place oyster species in their respective habitats to prevent environmental harm to nearby oyster reefs.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt; More information is available in local extension agencies within the state you live in.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Economic value ==
Oyster reefs provide essential habitats for many ecological and economically important fish as well as invertebrate species.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Healthy oyster populations improve the quality of water, which in turn improves commercial and recreational fishing, recreational boating, and [[ecotourism]].&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Not only does oyster restoration create additional jobs through the duration of projects, but it also safeguards many other jobs ranging from marine construction to scientific research jobs.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Dr. Paul Zimba, Director of the Center for Coastal Studies at [[Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi]] said, "Oysters are an important ecological and economic resource. They create habitats for fish and shellfish, filter and clean bay waters, protect shorelines from erosion, and are a valued commercial fishery element."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markham|first=Derek|title=Reefs could be replenished with electric oysters|url=http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/reefs-could-be-replenished-electric-oysters.html|publisher=Tree Hugger|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquaculture'''

The research in [[aquaculture]] has been a major contributor to the development of viable oyster strains to assist the commercial aquaculture industry and local ecosystems.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The industry of aquaculture is booming with global profits exceeding $3,000,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Oyster restoration projects assist in the production of aquaculture harvests and have different procedural measures for different areas of the United States.

Aquaculture techniques vary geographically and represent regional differences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Some areas of the U.S. have enacted policies to lease out areas for aquaculture businesses to utilize the oyster-restored beds. These leasing policies will prove beneficial to job creation in coastal areas, improve the surrounding economy, and restore habitats where oyster restoration projects and commercial businesses occur.&lt;ref name="maryland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.maryland.gov/pressreleases/091203.asp |title=Governor O'Malley Proposes Oyster Restoration and Aquaculture Development Plan |publisher=Governor.maryland.gov |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, aquaculture has and will continue to gain recognition for providing sustainable harvesting methods.&lt;ref name="maryland1"/&gt;

== Social value ==
Oyster restoration has many recreational benefits. Improved water clarity and overall cleaner water greatly increases recreational fishing, boating and swimming. This allows locals and tourists to appreciate the environment around them.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

In many parts of the southeastern United States volunteer efforts are responsible for oyster restoration. Community-based oyster restoration programs allow people to become knowledgeable on the important benefits oysters provide to an ecosystem. This volunteerism connects individuals with their environment as well as ensures the existence of oyster populations for future generations to appreciate.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature2"/&gt; Areas of the southeastern United States, such as the coastal areas in the Gulf of Mexico, have a rich tradition related to oysters and other marine food that coastal areas provide. Oysters are part of the social culture in these areas and oyster restoration is a step towards preserving their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/elpubs/pdf/er01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to volunteering with oyster restoration projects, individuals with shoreline property—or those who have access to it—have the option of backyard shellfish gardening. This sustainable form of oyster harvesting allows for personal consumption or environmental enhancement and usually does not require special licenses or permits.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Specific examples in the southeastern United States ==

=== Florida ===
The Oyster Reef Restoration began in June 2009 and is expected to be completed by the fall of 2010. The project is funded by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. The goal of the project is to restore the important oyster habitat in the St. Lucie and Loxahatchee Estuaries, two of the largest brackish water systems on the east coast of Florida, where over the last 50 years oyster populations have declined by as much as 75%.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

=== South Carolina ===
South Carolina Oyster Restoration and Enhancement (SCORE) is another volunteer oyster restoration movement. SCORE operates under the direction of the [[South Carolina Department of Natural Resources]] (SCDNR) and began in May 2001. The sites span approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} of the South Carolina coastline and have constructed 188 oyster reefs at 35 sites since the program began.&lt;ref name="Restoration Sites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://score.dnr.sc.gov/deep.php?subject=24 |title=Restoration Sites |publisher=Score.dnr.sc.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===
The Eastern Oyster populations of the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River basins have plunged 97% to 3% of historic numbers throughout the last century.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt; In response to this drastic change, the Citizens’ Oyster Gardening Project (COGP) began. COGP is an environmental demonstration project that encourages oyster gardening aimed to reestablish populations of native Eastern Oysters in North Carolina through education and aquaculture methods. Educational workshops teach volunteers how to measure water quality and give information on oyster gardening techniques as well as necessary tools and materials. Advocacy through networking by volunteers is key to COGP’s success.&lt;ref name="Aqu Cogp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carteret.edu/aqu/cogp/ |title=Aqu Cogp |publisher=Carteret.edu |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific examples in Eastern United States ==

=== New York ===
As of September 2016, the Environmental Protection Department of New York City has added nearly 50,000 adult oysters to Jamaica Bay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/nyregion/oyster-project-new-york-harbor.html|title=Oysters Are Nearly Extinct in New York Waters. This Team Is Trying to Coax Them Back.|last=Schmidt|first=Samantha|date=2016-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-27|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding comes from a grant of $1 million given by the United States Interior Department's Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By inducing a self-sustaining oyster population into Jamaica Bay, potential benefits include: "improving water quality, protecting the shoreline from erosion and reviving habitats for fish and wildlife".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pete Malinowski is a founder and director of the [[Billion Oyster Project]] who hopes to rejuvenate 1 billion oysters into the New York City waters and says, “It used to be known for its oysters. At one time, half of the world’s oysters were harvested in the New York Harbor.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal seems ambitious but pales to the number of oysters that populated the waters in colonial times: 3 trillion oysters, and 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 annual spawn of oyster larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Catch The Fight For Our Local Seafood|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2015|isbn=978-1-59420-448-7|location=USA|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, 85 cages with five gallons of oysters each were tied to a 400 pound anchor and pulled into the harbor to be dropped. For 2 years the department will assess the surrounding water quality and monitor oyster beds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Palomar Observatory''' is an astronomical [[observatory]] located in [[San Diego County, California]], United States, {{convert|145|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Los Angeles]], California, in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]].  It is owned and operated by the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) located in [[Pasadena, California]]. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University, [http://www.astro.cornell.edu Dept. of Astronomy]: [http://www.astro.cornell.edu/facilities/palomar.php  Palomar Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory operates several telescopes, including the 200-inch ({{convert|200|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Hale Telescope]] and the 48-inch ({{convert|48|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Samuel Oschin Telescope]].  In addition, other instruments and projects have been hosted at the observatory, such as the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the historic 18-inch ({{convert|18|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Schmidt telescope]], Palomar Observatory's first telescope, dating from 1936.

==History==

===Hale's vision for large telescopes and Palomar Observatory===

Astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]], whose vision created the Palomar Observatory, built the world's largest telescope four times. He published an article that was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that the American people would understand and support his project even though the country was in the depths of the Great Depression.

Hale followed this article with a letter to the International Education Board (later absorbed into the [[General Education Board]]) of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] dated April 16, 1928 in which he requested funding for this project. In his letter, Hale stated:

"No method of advancing science is so productive as the development of new and more powerful instruments and methods of research. A larger telescope would not only furnish the necessary gain in light space-penetration and photographic resolving power, but permit the application of ideas and devices derived chiefly from the recent fundamental advances in physics and chemistry."

===Hale Telescope===
{{Main|Hale telescope}}

The 200-inch telescope is named after astronomer and project manager [[George Hale]]. It was built by Caltech with a $6&amp;nbsp;million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, using a [[Pyrex]] blank manufactured by [[Corning Glass Works]] under the direction of George McCauley after several years of unsuccessful attempts by [[General Electric]] under Dr. A.L. Ellis. The first steps toward funding the construction of the 200 inch telescope were taken by Hale in 1928 and included a 23-ton glass block cast by [[José Antonio de Artigas Sanz]]. [[John August Anderson|Dr. J.A. Anderson]] was the initial project manager assigned in  the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TtcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Super Camera of the Skies."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1942, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope (the largest in the world at that time) saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] January 26, 1949 targeting [[NGC 2261]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://365daysofastronomy.org/2009/01/26/january-26-60th-anniversary-of-hale-telescope-first-light/  "60th Anniversary of Hale Telescope,"] ''[[365 Days of Astronomy]]'' (podcast). January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The American astronomer [[Edwin Powell Hubble]] was the first astronomer to use the telescope.

The 200-inch telescope was the largest telescope in the world from 1949 until 1975, when the Russian [[BTA-6]] telescope saw [[first light (astronomy)|first light]]. Astronomers using the Hale Telescope have discovered distant objects at the edges of the known universe called [[quasar]]s and have given us the first direct evidence of stars in distant galaxies. They have studied the structure and chemistry of intergalactic clouds, leading to an understanding of the synthesis of elements in the universe, and have discovered thousands of [[asteroid]]s. A one-tenth-scale engineering model of the telescope at Corning Community College in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], home of the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) was used to discover at least one minor planet, [[34419 Corning]].{{JPL|34419|†}}

===Architecture and design===
[[File:Palomar Observatory Dome - High Resolution.jpg|thumb|Hale Telescope Dome]]

According to the Observatory's Public Affairs Office, [[Russell W. Porter]] was primarily responsible for the [[Art Deco]] architecture of the Observatory's buildings, including the dome of the 200–inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Max Mason]] directed the construction and [[Theodore von Karman]] was involved in the engineering.

===Palomar Observatory and light pollution===

Much of the surrounding region of Southern California has adopted shielded lighting to reduce the [[light pollution]] that would potentially affect the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa International Dark-Sky Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101110647/http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa |date=2008-01-01 }} (IDA): [http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/is020.pdf  "Sky Glow Effect on Existing Large Telescopes"], IDA Info #20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescopes and instruments==
[[Image:P48 1994 Jean Large.jpg|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Jean Mueller]] posing with the [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] ]]

* The 200-inch [[Hale Telescope]] was first proposed in 1928 and has been operational since 1948. It was the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescope in the world]] for 45 years.&lt;ref name=HALE&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 200-inch Hale Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 60-inch reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building. It was dedicated in 1970 to take some of the load off of the Hale Telescope. This telescope was used to discover the first [[brown dwarf]] star.&lt;ref name=60IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 60-inch Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/60-inch.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 48-inch [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] was started in 1938 and installed in 1948. It was initially called the 48–inch Schmidt, and was dedicated to [[Samuel Oschin]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=SOT&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Samuel Oschin Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] was discovered using this instrument.&lt;ref name=SOTD&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Discoveries from Palomar Observatory’s 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html#science |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of Eris triggered the discussions in the international astronomy community that led to [[Pluto]] being re-classified as a [[dwarf planet]].

===Former instruments===

* An 18-inch [[Schmidt camera]] became the first operational telescope at the Palomar in 1936.  In the 1930s, [[Fritz Zwicky]], a Caltech astronomer, discovered over 100 [[supernovae]] in other galaxies with this telescope and gathered the first evidence for dark matter.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] was discovered with this instrument in 1993.  It has since been retired and is on display at the small museum/visitor center.&lt;ref name=18IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 18-inch Schmidt Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#p18 |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] was a multi-telescope instrument that permitted astronomers to make very high resolution measurements of the sizes and positions of objects in space. The shapes of some bright stars have been measured with the PTI.  It operated from 1995 to 2008.&lt;ref name=PTI&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#pti |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Palomar Planet Search Telescope (PPST), aka ''Sleuth,'' was a {{Convert|0.1|m|in|abbr=on}} robotic telescope that operated from 2003 until 2008.  It was dedicated to the search for planets around other stars using the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] method.  It operated in conjunction with telescopes at [[Lowell Observatory]] and in the [[Canary Islands]] as part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).&lt;ref name=PPST&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Sleuth: The Palomar Planet Finder |url=http://palomarskies.blogspot.de/2009/10/goodbye-to-sleuth.html |publisher=Palomar Skies |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The observatory has completed several [[astronomical survey]]s: the first in the 1950s, the second in the 1980s and 1990s, and a third in 2003.

===POSS-I===
The initial [[National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]] (POSS or POSS-I), sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6 [[degree (angle)|degree]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescope. The survey covered the sky from a [[declination]] of +90 degrees ([[Celestial pole|celestial north pole]]) to -27 degrees and all [[right ascension]]s and had a sensitivity to +22 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees [[declination]] was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.

Fritz Zwicky was the first astronomer to observe on Mt. Palomar and was the father of the Sky Survey Technique.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech did recognize Fritz Zwicky's sky survey pioneering work; however, The Big Picture project failed to recognize his contribution to the sky survey technique in the introductory panel at the Griffith Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) produced images which were based on the photographic data developed in the course of POSS-I.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS): [http://aps.umn.edu/ MAPS catalogue;] Mollise, Rod. (2006). {{Google books|Z0mvZk0s_TMC|''The Urban Astronomer's Guide: a Walking tour of the Cosmos for City Sky Watchers,'' p. 238.|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.B. Whiteoak, an Australian radio astronomer, used the same instrument to broaden this POSS-I data further.  Whiteoaks observations extended south to about -45 degrees [[declination]], using the same field centers as the corresponding northern declination zones. Unlike POSS-I, the [[Whiteoak extension]] consisted only of red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates.

===POSS-II===
{{Redirect|Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|POSS I|Palomar Sky Survey}}

The '''Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey''' ('''POSS II''', sometimes '''Second Palomar Sky Survey''') was performed in the 1980s and 1990s that made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was given an achromatic corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ), red (IIIaF) and near infrared (IVN) plates, respectively. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, [[J. Dave Mendenhall]], K. Rykoski, [[Jeffrey L. Phinney]] and [[Jean Mueller]] (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets during the course of POSS II and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then graduate student C. Wilson early in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516193335/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html |date=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the completion of the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), POSS II was the most extensive wide-field sky survey ever. When completed, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] will surpass ''POSS I'' and ''POSS II'' in depth, although the POSS covers almost 2.5 times more area on the sky.

POSS II also exists in digitized form (i.e., the photographic plates were scanned), both in photographic form as the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS)&lt;ref&gt;NASA/Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).: [http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/  &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ultimission &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rchive at &lt;u&gt;ST&lt;/u&gt;ScI (MAST)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=this appears to be an incomplete sentence|date=March 2012}}

===QUEST===
The multi-year POSS projects were followed by the Palomar [[Quasar Equatorial Survey Team]] (QUEST) Variability survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech press release: [http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12417.html "New Sky Survey Begins at Palomar Observatory."] July 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This survey yielded results that were used by several projects, including the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] project. Another program that used the QUEST results discovered [[90377 Sedna]] on 14 November 2003, and around 40 [[Kuiper belt]] objects. Other programs that share the camera are [[Shri Kulkarni]]'s search for [[Gamma ray burster|gamma-ray bursts]] (this takes advantage of the automated telescope's ability to react as soon as a burst is seen and take a series of snapshots of the fading burst), [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]]' search for [[supernova]]e to test whether the [[universe's expansion]] is accelerating or not, and [[S. George Djorgovski]]'s [[quasar]] search.

The camera for the Palomar QUEST Survey was a mosaic of 112 [[Charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) covering the whole (4 degree by 4 degree) field of view of the Schmidt telescope, the largest CCD mosaic used in an astronomical camera when built. This instrument was used to produce The Big Picture, the largest astronomical photograph ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ "The Big Picture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204102050/http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Big Picture is on display at [[Griffith Observatory]].

===Current research===
Current research programs on the 200-inch Hale Telescope cover the range of the observable universe including studies on near-Earth asteroids, outer solar system planets, Kuiper Belt Objects, star formation, exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;JPL: [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-090 "Planet-Hunting Method Succeeds at Last."] May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; gamma-ray bursts, black holes, quasars and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl Hale Telescope Observing Runs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212205940/http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope is actively working on a new sky survey, the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] (PTF).&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/ Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 60-inch telescope is used for a variety of projects including follow-up observations for the Palomar Transient Factory and is a rapid response telescope for [[gamma-ray bursts]].

===Clearest images===
In September 2007, a team of [[astronomer]]s from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] released some of the clearest pictures ever taken of [[outer space]].  The pictures were obtained through the use of a new hybrid "[[Lucky imaging]]" and "[[adaptive optics]]" system that sharpens pictures taken from the Palomar Observatory.  The resolution attained exceeds that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6975961.stm "'Clearest' images taken of space,"] BBC.

==Visiting==

The Palomar Observatory is an active research facility. However, parts of it are open to the public during the day. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the 200-inch telescope daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The observatory is open 7 days a week, year round, except for December 24 and 25 and during times of inclement weather. Guided tours of the 200-inch Hale Telescope dome and observing area are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October.  Details are available at the [http://palomar-observatory.org Observatory's web site].   There is a visitor's center and a gift shop on the grounds. Behind-the-scenes tours for the public are offered through the community support group, [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/friends.html Friends of Palomar Observatory].  Periodic tours are also organized by the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben H. Fleet Science Center: [http://www.rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html Palomar Observatory tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030411112150/http://rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html |date=2003-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The observatory is located off [[California State Route 76|State Route 76]] in northern [[San Diego County, California]], is two hours' drive from downtown [[San Diego]], and three hours' drive from central [[Los Angeles]] ( [[UCLA]], [[LAX]] airport ).  Those staying at nearby Palomar Campground can visit Palomar Observatory by hiking {{convert|2.2|mi|km}} up Observatory Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Observatory Trail in Cleveland National Forest | url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/observatory-trail-palomar-mountain/ | website=hikespeak.com | publisher=Hikespeak | accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the October 11 and 12, 1989, [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic strips, Calvin has a dream where Stupendous Man takes the lens from the Palomar Observatory telescope (though really the telescope has a mirror and not a lens) and uses it to destroy his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/search.php?phrase=stupendous+man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian band [[The Rheostatics]]' 1992 release ''[[Whale Music (album)|Whale Music]]'' features a track entitled "Palomar." The song depicts a man named Palomar on the top of a mount, cleaning his lenses with saline waters, and assembling his kaleidoscope in his lonely observatory.  The song presents a visual characterization of a man on a mountain and his relationship with his best friend, a dog.

In 1994, Palomar is mentioned in the first episode of season 2 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]". [[Fox Mulder]] refers to Hale's suggestion that an [[elf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Hale.html Biography of George Ellery Hale] at scienceworld.wolfram.com&lt;/ref&gt; crawled through his window and told him to build the observatory.

The band [[Wellwater Conspiracy]]'s 1997 debut album, ''[[Declaration of Conformity]]'', contains an instrumental track entitled "Palomar Observatory."  Wellwater Conspiracy singer/drummer [[Matt Cameron]] grew up in [[San Diego]] near the observatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14062">'''The Papaye Peasant Movement''', Mouvman Peyizan Papay (MPP) in [[Haitian Creole]], is recognized as both the largest peasant movement in Haiti and a grass-roots organization (GRO). MPP has approximately 60,000 members, including 20,000 women and 10,000 youths.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2005/islands|website=The Goldman Environmental Prize|publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is localized in the Central Plateau, home to about 13% of the Haitian population, the majority of whom are rural [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] or agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographical Context|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Geographical-context,53-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP focuses on re-establishing [[food sovereignty]] in [[Haiti]] through a number or programs and methods which include educating people on [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] methods and organizing skills. While these are the primary foci of MPP, the organization has expanded to provide a plethora of other services to its members, including legal aid, health care services, and university scholarships. The movement seeks to empower peasants to control their own livelihood, thus decreasing dependency on multinational organizations which have flooded the Haitian agricultural market in recent decades.

== Organization ==

Workers in the same neighborhood join together to form groups which meet weekly. At least seven groups in the same region form a local assembly, which meets monthly. The regional assembly, comprising at least four local assemblies, meets every three months, while the general assembly – which all local assemblies attend – meets once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Organisation,66-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Papaye Peasant Movement was established in 1973 by [[Jean-Baptiste Chavannes (agronomist)|Jean-Baptiste Chavannes]], a Catholic lay-worker turned [[Agronomy|agronomist]], with the intent to collaborate with rural farmworkers in order to develop more efficient and more sustainable farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste ensures a future for Haitian farmers|url=http://grist.org/article/nijhuis-jean-baptiste/|website=Grist|publisher=Grist|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Chavannes originally worked with two small groups (groupements) of workers, MPP now includes over 4,000 groups. The organizations' activities have diversified over time, in a slow but methodical manner, beginning with economic initiatives.

In 1976, MPP implemented a savings and [[credit union]], SERE POU CHOFE (Haitian Creole for "Save to Warm") in part because the heads of the movement saw increasing personal income and tackling hunger is being inherently linked to one another. SERE POU CHOFE enabled members to where members deposit savings from which other members could borrow and then replenish.

In 1978, MPP created KONBIT SÈVO MEN AK KÈ ANSANM (Union of minds, hearts, and hands), also known as KOSMIKA, a multi-sector union which focused on storing and producing agricultural products, finding and building warehouses to store farming tools, and establishing a farmer's bank. The following year, MPP founded a youth leadership program and the Young Peasant Workers association or Jeunes Travailleurs Paysan (JTP) which works to educate youths on a variety of subjects and prepares them to take on leadership roles later in life.

The Movement of Women of MPP, along with a separate association for and run by women, was established in 1981 in order to attack [[gender inequality]] within the movement. These two entities focus on tackling violence against women, defending social and cultural rights, as well as promoting economic independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MPP|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-History-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, the MPP had to maintain a relatively low profile due to political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Duvalier]] regime in Haiti. When Duvalier was forced out in 1986, the movement began to gain political traction, and played a large role in supporting Operation Lavalas, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide|Jean-Bertrand Aristide's]] party. Aristide became the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 1991, only to be [[1991 Haitian coup d'état|overthrown]] a few months later. Many of the leaders of MPP went into hiding, while others were imprisoned or tortured. Chavannes Jean-Baptiste himself went into exile from 1993 to 1994. Nevertheless, the movement continued its activities and opened an office in Boston in order to spread information on a worldwide scale. Full operations resumed in 1994 when Haiti established a constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uvin|first1=Peter|title=Fighting Hunger at the Grassroots: Paths to Scaling Up|journal=World Development|date=January 1995|volume=23|issue=6|pages=927–938|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(95)00028-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention areas ==

=== Community education and legal aid ===

MPP provides a number of training education programs and workshops for group members, while also providing university-level training for middle managers who often come back to the organization. Higher-level workshops are also provided to trained instructors.

The youth education program, JTP, is organized by a three-tier system: Pre-Nursery JTP (PPJTP) for children ages 5 to 10, Nursery JTP (PJTP) for children ages 10 to 15, and JTP for people ages 15 through 30, though members of JTP can also become group members or leaders within MPP. JTP programs provide courses on sex education, sports, music, dance, theater, and cultural activities. Some participants receive university scholarships and are sent to study in Port-au-Prince or abroad.

MPP also has a legal aid department which informs members of their rights, basic legal training, as well as legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Education|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Education.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic services ===

MPP develops [[cooperative]]s within different assemblies and trains assembly members to manage the financial aspects of their projects. The organization also conducts feasibility and productivity studies, helps grous prepare reports, and provides economic counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economy and Cooperatives|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Economy-and-Cooperatives.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February, 2013, MPP celebrated the inauguration of a modern corn storage and processing mill which was built with the help of two Canadian organizations: [[Development and Peace (Canada)|Développement et Paix]] and [[ACDI/VOCA|ACDI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration of a storage center at Marmmont|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Inauguration-of-a-storage-centre.html|website=Mouvment Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community healthcare ===

MPP has a number of health projects relating to hygiene, [[Reproductive health|sexual health]], nutrition, and parenting skills. It also has a health center with a laboratory, and a pharmacy where community members can receive services and medical consultations. MPP also has a community health worker program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Healthcare|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Healthcare.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

=== Agro-ecology ===

About 75% of the Haitian population lives in rural areas, a large portion of whom practice subsistence agriculture. Until the 1980s, the country was in large part self-sustainable in terms of rice, manioc, and potato production. After the dismantlement of the Duvalier dictatorship, however, organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] urged the country to liberalize markets and undergo structural reform, leading to a rural exodus and greatly affecting the agricultural sector. The liberalization of markets caused government funding for agricultural and public-sector  development to decrease, further depleting the agricultural sector. Many [[multinational corporation]]s took advantage of the newly liberalized market to export goods, creating Haitian dependency on agricultural imports. Additionally, [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] has caused mass erosion, thus decreasing soil arability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP)|url=http://map.seedmap.org/solutions/food-sovereignty/people-farmer-led-movements/papaye-peasant-movement-mpp/|website=Seed Map|publisher=Seed Map|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP's [[Agroecology|agro-ecology]] program seeks to address the issue of dependence and food sovereignty by focusing on forms of agriculture based on environmental health. The organization teaches innovative farming practices, including germinating seedlings inside discarded tires and using other methods so as not to exhaust the land. Farmers focus on growing organic, indigenous crops in order to maintain biodiversity, and thus reject hybrid and GMO seed donations from multinational corporations. The program also comprises a reforestation component in order to help improve soil quality and prevent further erosion. Since its inception, MPP members have planted over 20&amp;nbsp;million trees, and their efforts continue.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Beverly|title=Haitian Farmers Resist GM Crops, Environmental Destruction|url=http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/89771:haitian-farmers-resist-gm-crops-environmental-destruction|accessdate=21 November 2014|agency=Truthout|publisher=Truthout|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water management ===

MPP conducts courses on [[Water resource management|water management]] and storage. Methods include draining water from kitchens and showers into ponds filled, gravel, and charcoal, thus producing clean water. This water is then used to for irrigation and fish breeding. MPP also uses cisterns to catch water on rooves, mountain-top catchment lakes, and water-drip irrigation systems in order to save and store water.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt;

=== Alternative energy ===

MPP has taken on multiple [[alternative energy]] initiatives. Leaders have conducted workshops on how to install [[solar panel]]s and how to build solar-powered batteries; they have also established a facility to manufacture solar products.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"/&gt; Additionally, MPP promotes the use of natural fertilizer such as manure and compost.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt; They also produce alternative charcoal, bio-fuel from waste, and other alternative energy methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Energy|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Alternative-Energy,69-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-villages ===

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], there was an urban exodus to rural areas like Papaye, particularly from the Haitian capital of [[Port-au-Prince]]. MMP set up a camp for internally displaced people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leitch|first1=Laurie|title=Hope in the Ruins|journal=Psychotherapy Network|date=August 2010|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaborations with partners such as [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] (UUSC), helped refugees build eco-villages. Earthquake survivors, MMP members, and volunteers built the houses, – survivors were paid a minimum salary for their work – taught urban dwellers sustainable farming methods, and set up personal and community gardens. Water management methods were also installed so that eco-village dwellers would have access to clean water. So far, the experiment has been a success and many other organizations are replicating this model in Haiti and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti Eco-village|url=http://vimeo.com/62163892|website=Vimeo|publisher=UUSC|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns and Public Events ==

=== World Environment Day Protest ===
In June, 2012, 12,000 Haitian farmers marched in the streets of the town of [[Hinche]] in order to protest multinational corporations pushing [[hybrid seed]]s and biofuels on local farmers.  They buried coffins inscribed with the names of a number of corporations as a part of the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmers say no to multinational offensive|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Farmers-say-no-to-multinational.html|website=Mouvement Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seeds for Haïti ===
The Seeds for Haïti campaign was launched inn 2012 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Sandy]] in collaboration with MPP's French partner, [[Frères des Hommes]].  The organizations were able to raise enough money to buy 20 tons of seeds in order to support Haitian farmers who lost their supply as a result of the hurricane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">In [[rhetoric]], a '''parenthesis''' (plural: ''parentheses''; from the [[Ancient Greek]] word παρένθεσις ''parénthesis'' 'injection, insertion', literally '(a) putting in beside') or '''parenthetical phrase''' is an explanatory or qualifying word, clause, or sentence inserted into a passage. The parenthesis could be left out and still form grammatically correct text.&lt;ref name="Walker1823"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Walker|title=A Rhetorical Grammar: In which the Common Improprieties in Reading and Speaking are Detected ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TsJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=1823|publisher=T. Cadell|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parentheses are usually marked off by round or square [[bracket]]s, dashes, or commas.

==Examples==
;Billy-bob, a great singer, was not a good dancer.:The phrase ''a great singer'', set off by commas, is both an [[appositive]] and a parenthesis.
;A dog (not a cat) is an animal that barks.:The phrase ''not a cat'' is a parenthesis.
;My umbrella (which is somewhat broken) can still shield the two of us from the rain.:The phrase ''which is somewhat broken'' is a parenthesis.
;Please, Gerald, come here!: ''Gerald'' is both a noun of [[direct address]] and a parenthesis.

==Types==
The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.&lt;ref&gt;''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interjection: My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!
*Aside: My father, if you don’t mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.
*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.
*Absolute phrase: My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.
*Free modifier: My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.
*Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.
*Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.

==Punctuation==
While a parenthesis need not be written enclosed by the [[bracket|curved brackets]] called ''parentheses'', their use, principally around rhetorical parentheses, has made the [[punctuation mark]]s the only common use for the term in most contexts.

'''Participatory GIS''' ('''PGIS''') is a [[Public participation|participatory]] approach to [[spatial planning]] and spatial information and [[communications management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/participatory_gis_opportunity_or_oxymoron.pdf |title=Participatory GIS: opportunity or oxymoron? |author1=Jo Abbot |author2=Robert Chambers |author3=Christine Dunn |author4=Trevor Harris |author5=Emmanuel de Merode |author6=Gina Porter |author7=Janet Townsend |author8=Daniel Weiner |date=October 1998 |work=PLA notes 33 |pages=27–34 |publisher= |accessdate=28 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081409/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/participatory_gis_opportunity_or_oxymoron.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Abbot, J. et al. 1998.

PGIS combines [[Participatory Learning and Action]] (PLA) methods with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |title=Overview: Mapping for Change: The emergence of a new practice |author1=Jon Corbett |author2=Giacomo Rambaldi |author3=Peter Kyem |author4=Dan Weiner |author5=Rachel Olson |author6=Julius Muchemi |author7=Mike McCall |author8=Robert Chambers |year=2006 |work=54:13-19 IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081053/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGIS combines a range of geo-spatial information management tools and methods such as sketch maps, [[participatory 3D modelling]] (P3DM), [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[global positioning system]] (GPS) data to represent peoples' spatial knowledge in the forms of (virtual or physical) two- or three-dimensional maps used as interactive vehicles for spatial learning, discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=246&amp;article=263&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication in Developing Countries |author=Rambaldi G., Kwaku Kyem A.

PGIS practice is geared towards community empowerment through measured, demand-driven, user-friendly and integrated applications of geo-spatial technologies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} GIS-based maps and spatial analysis become major conduits in the process. A good PGIS practice is embedded into long-lasting spatial decision-making processes, is flexible, adapts to different socio-cultural and bio-physical environments, depends on multidisciplinary facilitation and skills and builds essentially on visual language. The practice integrates several tools and methods whilst often relying on the combination of 'expert' skills with socially differentiated local knowledge. It promotes interactive participation of stakeholders in generating and managing spatial information and it uses information about specific landscapes to facilitate broadly-based decision making processes that support effective communication and community advocacy.

If appropriately utilized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |title=Practical ethics for PGIS practitioners, facilitators, technology intermediaries and researchers |author1=Gicomo Rambaldi |author2=Robert Chambers |author3=Mike McCall |author4=Jefferson Fox |year=2006 |work=PLA 54:106-113, IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081038/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice could exert profound impacts on community empowerment, innovation and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=247&amp;article=264&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Mapping and Geographic Information Systems: Whose Map?

The '''pressuron''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] which couples to both gravity and matter theorised in 2013.&lt;ref name="2013PhRvD..88d1504M"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minazzoli, O. |author2=Hees, A. |date=August 2013 |title= Intrinsic Solar System decoupling of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=041504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=2013PhRvD..88d1504M |arxiv=1308.2770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally postulated without self-interaction potential, the pressuron is also a [[dark energy]] candidate when it has such a potential.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli, O.|author2=Hees, A. |date=July 2014  |title= Late-time cosmology of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal multiplicative coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=90 |issue= 2 |pages=023017 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhRvD..90b3017M|arxiv = 1404.4266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressuron takes its name from the fact that it decouples from matter in pressure-less regimes,&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H/&gt; allowing the [[scalar-tensor theory]] of gravity involving it to pass [[Tests of general relativity#Post-Newtonian tests of gravity|solar system tests]], as well as tests on the [[equivalence principle]], even though it is fundamentally coupled to matter. Such a decoupling mechanism could explain why gravitation seems to be well described by [[general relativity]] at present epoch, while it could actually be more complex than that. Because of the way it couples to matter, the pressuron is a special case of the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]].&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D&gt;{{cite journal|author=Damour, T.|author2=Polyakov, A.M. |date=July 1994  |title= The string dilaton and a least coupling principle |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=423 |issue=  |pages=532–558 |doi= 10.1016/0550-3213(94)90143-0|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321394901430|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  1994NuPhB.423..532D|arxiv = hep-th/9401069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is one of the possible solutions to the present non-observation of various signals coming from massless or light scalar fields that are generically predicted in string theory.

== Mathematical formulation ==

The action of the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;S= \frac{1}{c}\int  d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \sqrt{\Phi} \mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi) + 
 \frac{1}{2\kappa}\left(\Phi  R-\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2-V(\Phi) \right) \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scalar curvature|Ricci scalar]] constructed from the [[Metric tensor|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric determinant, &lt;math&gt;\kappa=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the gravitational constant&lt;ref&gt;Note however that it is different from the [[Gravitational constant|effective constant]] measured with [[Cavendish experiment|Cavendish-type experiments]] (see also [[Scalar-tensor theory]])&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[Speed of light|velocity of light]] in vacuum, &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the pressuron potential and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|matter Lagrangian]]&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Electroweak interaction#After electroweak symmetry breaking|Electroweak lagrangian]] and [[Quantum chromodynamics#Lagrangian|Quantum chromodynamics lagrangian]]&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the non-gravitational fields.

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \kappa~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Phi}}T_{\mu \nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_{\mu} \nabla_{\nu} -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi  
+\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi^2}\left[\partial_{\mu} \Phi \partial_{\nu} \Phi - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}(\partial_{\alpha}\Phi)^2\right]-g_{\mu \nu} \frac{V(\Phi)}{2 \Phi} ,&lt;/math&gt;

and

where &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]] of the matter field,
and &lt;math&gt;T = g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is its [[Trace_(linear_algebra)|trace]].

=== Decoupling mechanism ===

If one considers a pressure-free [[perfect fluid]] (also known as a "dust"), the effective material Lagrangian becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88b7506M&gt;{{cite journal

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ith particle, &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; its position, and &lt;math&gt;\delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac delta function]], 
while at the same time the trace of the stress-energy tensor reduces to &lt;math&gt;T = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, there is an exact cancellation of the pressuron material source term &lt;math&gt; \left(  T -  \mathcal{L}_m \right) &lt;/math&gt;, and hence the pressuron effectively decouples from pressure-free matter fields.

In other words, the specific coupling between the scalar field and the material fields in the Lagrangian leads to a decoupling between the scalar field and the matter fields in the limit that the matter field is exerting zero pressure. 

=== Link to string theory ===

The pressuron shares some characteristics with the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]],&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D/&gt;&lt;ref name=Minazzoli2014119&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli O. |date=July 2014  |title= On the cosmic convergence mechanism of the massless dilaton|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=735 |issue= 2 |pages=119–121 |doi=  10.1016/j.physletb.2014.06.027|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314004304|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhLB..735..119M|arxiv = 1312.4357}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can actually be viewed as a special case of the wider family of possible dilatons.&lt;ref name=PhysRevD.65.023508&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gasperini, M.|author2=Piazza, F.|author3=Veneziano, G.|last-author-amp=yes |date=December 2001  |title= Quintessence as a runaway dilaton |journal=Physical Review D |volume=65 |issue= 2 |pages=023508 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2002PhRvD..65b3508G|arxiv = gr-qc/0108016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since perturbative [[string theory]] cannot currently give the expected coupling of the string dilaton with material fields in the effective 4-dimension action, it seems conceivable that the pressuron may be the string dilaton in the 4-dimension effective action.

== Experimental search ==

=== Solar System ===

According to Minazzoli and Hees,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt; [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian]] tests of gravitation in the Solar System should lead to the same results as what is expected from [[general relativity]], except for gravitational redshift experiments, which should deviate from [[general relativity]] with a relative magnitude of the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega_0} \frac{P}{c^2 \rho} \sim \frac{10^{-6}}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current cosmological value of the scalar-field function &lt;math&gt;\omega(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the mean pressure and density of the Earth (for instance). Current best constraints on the gravitational redshift come from [[Gravity Probe A|gravity probe A]] and are at the &lt;math&gt;10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; level only. Therefore, the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron is weakly constrained by Solar System experiments.

=== Cosmological variation of the fundamental coupling constants ===

Because of its non-minimal couplings, the pressuron leads to a variation of the [[Coupling constant|fundamental coupling constants]]&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is a classical effect, and it should not be confused with the [[Coupling constant#Running coupling|quantum running]] of the coupling constants&lt;/ref&gt; in regimes where it effectively couples to matter.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H /&gt; However, since the pressuron decouples in both the [[matter-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by pressure-less material fields) and the [[dark-energy-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by dark energy&lt;ref&gt;In the context of the pressuron, dark energy can either be a [[cosmological constant]] or due to a non-vanishing scalar potential &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), the pressuron is also weakly constrained by current cosmological tests on the variation of the coupling constants.

=== Test with binary pulsars ===

Although no calculations seem to have been performed regarding this issue, it has been argued that [[binary pulsar]]s should give greater constraints on the existence of the pressuron because of the high pressure of bodies involved in such systems.&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt;

'''Remanence''' or '''remanent magnetization''' or '''residual magnetism''' is the [[magnetization]] left behind in a [[ferromagnetic]] material (such as [[iron]]) after an external [[magnetic field]] is removed. It is also the measure of that magnetization.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi&gt;{{Harvnb|Chikazumi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, when a magnet is "magnetized" it has remanence.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, it is still in the Earth's field, but that has little effect on the remanence of a [[hard magnet]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The remanence of magnetic materials provides the magnetic memory in [[magnetic storage]] devices, and is used as a source of information on the past Earth's magnetic field in [[paleomagnetism]].

The equivalent term  '''residual magnetization''' is generally used in engineering applications. In [[transformer]]s, [[electric motors]] and [[Electric generator|generators]] a large residual magnetization is not desirable (see also [[electrical steel]]) as it is an unwanted contamination, for example a magnetization remaining in an [[electromagnet]] after the current in the coil is turned off. Where it is unwanted, it can be removed by [[degaussing]].

Sometimes the term '''retentivity''' is used for remanence measured in units of [[magnetic flux density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetic Tape Storage and Handling|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub54/glossary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Saturation remanence===
[[Image:B-H loop.png|thumb|'''Fig. 1''' A family of AC [[hysteresis]] loops for grain-oriented electrical steel ('''''B'''''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; denotes ''remanence'' and '''''H'''''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''[[coercivity]]'').]]
The default definition of magnetic remanence is the magnetization remaining in zero field after a large magnetic field is applied (enough to achieve [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]).&lt;ref name=Chikazumi/&gt; The effect of a magnetic [[hysteresis loop]] is measured using instruments such as a [[vibrating sample magnetometer]]; and the zero-field intercept is a measure of the remanence. In [[physics]] this measure is converted to an average [[magnetization]] (the total [[magnetic moment]] divided by the volume of the sample) and denoted in equations as '''''M'''''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. If it must be distinguished from other kinds of remanence, then it is called the ''saturation remanence'' or ''saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM)'' and denoted by '''''M'''''&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;.

In engineering applications the residual magnetization is often measured using a [[B-H analyzer]], which measures the response to an AC magnetic field  (as in Fig. 1). This is represented by a [[flux density]] '''''B'''''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. This value of remanence is one of the most important parameters characterizing [[permanent magnet]]s; it measures the strongest magnetic field they can produce. [[Neodymium magnets]], for example, have a remanence approximately equal to 1.3 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]].

=== Isothermal remanence ===
Often a single measure of remanence does not provide adequate information on a magnet. For example, magnetic tapes contain a large number of small magnetic particles (see [[magnetic storage]]), and these particles are not identical.  Magnetic minerals in rocks may have a wide range of magnetic properties (see [[rock magnetism]]). One way to look inside these materials is to add or subtract small increments of remanence. One way of doing this is first [[Magnet#Magnetization and demagnetization|demagnetizing]] the magnet in an AC field, and then applying a field '''''H''''' and removing it.  This remanence, denoted by '''''M'''''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;('''''H'''''), depends on the field.&lt;ref name=Wohlfarth&gt;{{Harvnb|Wohlfarth|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''initial remanence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCurrie|Gaunt|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM)''.&lt;ref name="Néel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Néel|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of IRM can be obtained by first giving the magnet a saturation remanence in one direction and then applying and removing a magnetic field in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=Wohlfarth/&gt;  This is called ''demagnetization remanence'' or ''DC demagnetization remanence'' and is denoted by symbols like '''''M'''''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;('''''H'''''), where '''''H''''' is the ''magnitude'' of the field.&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer&gt;{{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another kind of remanence can be obtained by demagnetizing the saturation remanence in an ac field.  This is called ''AC demagnetization remanence'' or ''alternating field demagnetization remanence'' and is denoted by symbols like '''''M'''''&lt;sub&gt;af&lt;/sub&gt;('''''H''''').

If the particles are noninteracting single-domain particles with uniaxial anisotropy, there are simple linear relations between the remanences.&lt;ref name=Wohlfarth/&gt;

=== Anhysteretic remanence ===
Another kind of laboratory remanence is ''anhysteretic remanence'' or ''anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM)''. This is induced by exposing a magnet to a large alternating field plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an ''anhysteretic magnetization'', and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic magnetization curve is often close to an average of the two branches of the [[hysteresis loop]],&lt;ref name=Bozorth&gt;{{Harvnb|Bozorth|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jiles|Atherton|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several ways for experimental measurement of Anhysteretic Magnetization Curve, based on fluxmeters and DC biased demagnetization &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nowicki|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jaep|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the acquisition of [[natural remanent magnetization]] in rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Banerjee|Mellema|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">SX000i - ''International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications'', is a specification developed jointly by a multinational team from the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD) and [[Aerospace Industries Association]] (AIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia-aerospace.org/national_aerospace_standards/s-series_ils_specifications/ AIA page on the S-Series ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; SX000i is part of the [[S-Series of ILS specifications]].

SX000i provides information, guidance and instructions to ensure compatibility and the commonality of [[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS) processes among the S-Series suite of ILS specifications jointly developed by both associations.

By defining common logistics processes to be used across all S-Series ILS specifications and the interactions of the current S-Series ILS specifications with the logistics processes, the SX000i forms the basis for sharing and exchanging data securely through the life of products and services, not only within the support domain, but also with other domains such as Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap239.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=358730&amp;folderId=362247&amp;name=DLFE-10795.pdf An ISO standard for Product Support data interoperability: ISO 10303-239 edition 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The SX000i also provides governance for the maintenance of current S-Series ILS specifications and the development of new S-Series ILS specifications.

SX000i builds on existing standards and specifications so as to provide a unified view of sometimes contradictory ILS specifications and publications.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard and Fabrycky, Systems Engineering and Analysis, Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commandant Instruction M4105.8, United States Coast Guard System Integrated Logistic Support Policy Manual,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=514838 Integrated Product Support (IPS) Element Guidebook, Defense Acquisition University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DEF STAN 00-600, Integrated Logistic Support&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DoD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33898 ISO/IEC TR 19760: 2003, Systems engineering – A guide for the application of ISO/IEC 15288 (System life cycle processes)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-886-volume-07-supportability-engineering JSP 886 Volume 7 Part 1,Integrated Logistic Support]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NPD 7500.1D, NASA Policy Directive – Program and Project Life-Cycle Logistics Support Policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA/SP-2007-6105 Rev1,NASA Systems Engineering Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NATO AAP-20, Allied Administrative Publication 20 - Phased Armaments Programming System (PAPS)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NATO ALP-10, NATO Guidance on Integrated Logistics Support for Multinational Armament Programmes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OCCAR OMP1, OCCAR Management Procedure 1 (OMP1) - Principal Programme Management Procedures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SEMP Florida's Statewide Systems Engineering Management Plan, Appendix U, Integrated Logistic Support Plan Template&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/acquisition-operating-framework UK MoD Acquisition Operating Framework (AOF)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Army Regulation 700-127, Integrated Product Support&lt;/ref&gt; A reference and mapping of SX000i to these documents has been provided in Chapter 6.

== Purpose of the guide ==
SX000i provides a guide for the use of the S-series ILS specifications by ILS managers and practitioners, as well as for the management and future development of the specifications by the ILS specification Council and ILS specification Steering Committees (SC) and Working Groups (WG). 
SX000i:
* explains the vision and objectives for the suite of S-Series ILS specifications
* provides a framework that documents the global ILS process and interactions
* explains how the ASD/AIA S-Series ILS specifications interface with other standardization domains including program management, global supply chain management, engineering, manufacturing, security, safety, configuration management, quality, data exchange and integration, and life cycle cost
* describes the global governance of the S-Series ILS specifications development
* provides guidance on how to satisfy specific business requirements using an appropriate selection of defined processes and specifications

== SX000i development history ==
During the development of the S-Series ILS specifications, the different ASD/AIA Steering Committees and Working Groups identified the need for an "umbrella" specification to ensure the compatibility and commonality of ILS processes among the S-Series ILS specifications.

In 2011, the decision was made to develop, publicize and maintain an [[Integrated Logistics Support]] Guide, named SX000i, so as to provide a compatible and common ILS process to be used in the other S-Series ILS specifications.  Development of SX000i was viewed by the ILS Specifications Council as an essential step to achieve the vision for the S-Series ILS specifications.

In June 2011, the SX000i working group was formed and SX000i development started.  The current title of SX000i, International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications, was approved by the ASD/AIA ILS Specifications Council in June 2012.

Following the creation of the SX000i working group, the ASD/AIA Data Model and Exchange Working Group (DMEWG) was formed under the ILS Specifications Council in October 2011.  Working in close cooperation with the SX000i team, the DMEWG coordinates the data modeling activities that are performed within the respective S-Series ILS Specification SCs and WGs so as to harmonize and consolidate data requirements into one coherent data model. 
Publication of SX000i, and continuing DMEWG coordination activities, enable the achievement of the vision for the suite of ILS specifications "to apply common logistics processes so as to share and exchange data securely through the life of products and services".

The companies and organizations that are currently participating in the development of SX000i are:
* [[Airbus]] (France)

SX000i issue 1.0 was published in December 2015. An Issue 1.1 was published in July 2016.

The SX000i Steering Committee is currently co-chaired by the Spanish representative of [[Airbus Defence and Space]], on behalf of ASD, and [[Boeing]], on behalf of AIA.

== Intended use ==
SX000i is intended:
* To be a starting point for any potential users or new projects that would want to use the S-Series ILS specifications.
* To be an overview and coordinating document for all members of the international ILS community, engaged in the use and development of the S-Series ILS specifications on existing projects.
In that context, SX000i was developed for three primary applications: 
* New Product development 
* Support of existing Products
* ILS specification development and maintenance

== Target audiences ==
The target audiences for SX000i are:

=== Contractors ===
SX000i can be used by prime contractors, original equipment manufacturers, and suppliers as a reference for initially establishing their Product support strategies and plans, and selecting specifications to support those plans. SX000i can also be used to evaluate existing Product support strategies and projects.

=== Customers ===
SX000i can be used by customers to determine support requirements for new Products they are acquiring, or fielded Products for which they are seeking support, and to identify ILS specifications to be cited in solicitations.

=== ILS specifications Council ===
The ILS specifications Council uses SX000i to promote a commonality and interoperability among the S-Series ILS specifications.

=== ILS specification steering committees and working groups ===
Steering committees and working groups developing specifications use SX000i as a basis for describing relationships and interfaces between the ILS element(s) that their specification covers and: 	
* the other integrated logistic support elements
* the standardization domains
Steering committees use SX000i to ensure the compatibility of their specification with the other ILS specifications.
The Data modeling and Exchange Working group (DMEWG) uses SX000i to harmonize and consolidate data requirements into one coherent data model supporting all of the ILS specifications. 
Steering committees and working groups both use SX000i to ensure compliance with ILS specification Council governance requirements.

== SX000i structure ==
SX000i consists of six chapters:
* '''Chapter 1''', (Introduction) provides background information on the S-Series ILS specifications and SX000i.
* '''Chapter 2''', (Integrated logistics support framework), documents a global ILS process and interactions at the ILS element level. This chapter establishes the foundation for the remainder of SX000i chapters and all of the S-Series ILS specifications. 
* '''Chapter 3''', (Use of the S-Series ILS specifications in an ILS project), explains how the S-Series ILS specifications relate to the global ILS process and elements, and how to use them as part of an ILS project.
* '''Chapter 4''', (ILS specification governance), describes the structure of the S-Series ILS specifications organization and the processes used to manage the development and maintenance of those specifications. The target audience for this chapter is primarily the ILS specifications Council, and the SCs and WGs of the individual specifications.
* '''Chapter 5''', (Terms, abbreviations and acronyms), provides the definition of the main terms used in this specification, as well as a list of all the abbreviations and acronyms.
* '''Chapter 6''', (Comparison of specification terminology), provides a comparison of the terms, life cycle phases and ILS elements between SX000i and other international and military specifications, to enable users to better understand the underlying concepts.

== Availability ==
SX000i can be downloaded for free from its project [http://www.sx000i.org website]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">In [[systems science]], a  '''sampled-data system''' is a [[control system]] in which a continuous-time [[plant (control theory)|plant]] is controlled with a digital device. Under periodic [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]], the sampled-data system is time-varying but also periodic; thus, it may be modeled by a simplified discrete-time system obtained by discretizing the plant. However, this discrete model does not capture the inter-sample behavior of the real system, which may be critical in a number of applications.

The analysis of sampled-data systems incorporating full-time information leads to challenging control problems with a rich mathematical structure. Many of these problems have only been solved recently.

In global optimization, a '''state transition algorithm (STA)''' is an [[iterative method]] that generates a sequence of improving approximate solutions for an [[optimization problem]]. Due to its intrinsic properties, an STA has the ability to find a global optimal solution in probability and can guarantee an optimal solution.

The state transition algorithm &lt;ref name=Zhou2012State/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2014Nonlinear/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Optimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Discrete/&gt; was first proposed by Zhou et al. It is a stochastic global optimization method and aims to find a possible global or approximate optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. In the context of the STA, a solution to an optimization problem is regarded as a state, and updating a solution can be regarded as a state transition. Using the state-space representation,&lt;ref name=Friedland2005Control/&gt; it describes solutions updating in a unified framework, and the execution operators to update solutions are expressed as state transition matrices, which make it easy to understand and flexible to implement:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \mathbf{x}_k + B_k \mathbf{u}_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; stands for a current state, corresponding to a solution to an optimization problem;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and historical states;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_k &lt;/math&gt; is the fitness value at &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;;  
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_k, \mathbf{B}_k &lt;/math&gt; are state transformation matrices, which can be considered as execution operators; 
:  &lt;math&gt; f(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is the objective function or evaluation function. 
As a stochastic global optimization method, STA has the following properties:
* globality, STA has the ability to search the whole space;
* optimality, STA can guarantee to find an optimal solution; 
* convergence, the sequence generated by STA is convergent;
* rapidity, inherent advantages existing in STA to reduce the computational complexity;
* controllability, STA can control the search space flexibly.

== Continuous state transition algorithm (CSTA) ==
In continuous STA, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous variable, and four special state transformation operators are designed to generate new candidate solutions.

=== State transformation operators ===
(1) Rotation transformation (RT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \frac{1}{n\|\mathbf{x}_k\|_2} R_r \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the rotation factor, &lt;math&gt; R_r \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random matrix with its entries being uniformly distributed random variables defined on the interval [-1,1], and &lt;math&gt; \|\cdot\| &lt;/math&gt; is the 2-norm of a vector. 
The rotation transformation has the functionality to search in a hypersphere with maximal radius &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; , that is to say, &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}\|_2 \leq \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

(2) Translation transformation (TT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \beta R_t \frac{\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}}{\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}\|_2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the translation factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_t \in  \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
is a uniformly distributed random variable defined on the interval [0,1]. The translation transformation has the functionality to search along a line from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k-1} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; at the starting point &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; with maximal length &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;.

(3) Expansion transformation (ET)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \gamma R_e \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the expansion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_e \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution. The expansion transformation has the functionality to expand the entries in  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; to the range of &lt;math&gt; [-\infty, +\infty] &lt;/math&gt;, searching in the whole space.

(4) Axesion transformation (AT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \delta R_a \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the axesion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_a \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution and with only one random position having nonzero value. The axesion transformation aims to search along the axes.

=== Regular neighbourhood and sampling ===
For a given solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;, a candidate solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; is generated by using one time of the aforementioned state transformation operators. Since the state transition matrix in each state transformation is random, the generated candidate solution is not unique. Based on a given point, it is not difficult to imagine that a '''regular neighbourhood''' will be automatically formed when using certain state transformation operators.

Since the entries in state transition matrix obey certain stochastic distribution, for any given solution, the new candidate becomes a random vector and its corresponding solution (the value of a random vector) can be regarded as a '''sample'''. Considering that any two random state transition matrices in each state transformation operator are independent,
several times of state transformation (called the degree of search enforcement, &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; for short) based on the given solution are performed for certain state transformation operator, yielding &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples.

=== An update strategy ===
As mentioned above, based on the incumbent best solution, a total number of ''SE'' candidate solutions are sampled. A new best solution is selected from the candidate set by virtue of the evaluation function, denoted as &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt;. 
Then, an update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' is used to update the incumbent best solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{newBest} &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; f(\text{newBest}) &lt; f(\text{Best}), &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{Best} &lt;/math&gt; , otherwise

=== Algorithm procedure of the basic continuous STA ===
With the state transformation operators, sampling technique and update strategy, the basic continuous STA can be described as follows:

Step 1: Initiate a random solution &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} = 1, \alpha_{\min} = 10^{-4}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \beta = 1, \gamma = 1, \delta = 1, fc = 2, k = 0; &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Expansion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . Let us denote &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt; the best solution in &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples, if &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 3: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Rotation Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 4: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Axesion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 5: set &lt;math&gt; k = k + 1 &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_{\min} &lt;/math&gt;, set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;, else set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha /fc &lt;/math&gt;, and return to Step 2 until the maximum of iterations is met.

=== Philosophy behind the continuous STA ===
* The '''expansion transformation''' contributes to the globality since it has the functionality to search the whole space; 
*  The '''rotation transformation''' benefits the optimality since when &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small, the incumbent best solution becomes a local optimal solution;
* The update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' contributes to the convergence, that is to say, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{f(\text{Best}_k)_{k=1}^\infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent due to &lt;math&gt; f(\text{Best}_{k+1}) \leq f(\text{Best}_k) &lt;/math&gt; and the [[monotone convergence theorem]];
* The '''sampling technique''' (it can avoid complete enumeration) and the '''alternate use''' of state transformation operators help to reduce computational complexity;
* The parameters like &lt;math&gt; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta &lt;/math&gt; can be adjusted to control the search space.

==Applications of STA==

STA has found a variety of applications, like image segmentation,&lt;ref name=Han2015multi/&gt; 
task assignment,&lt;ref name=Dong2015discrete/&gt; energy consumption in the alumina evaporation process,&lt;ref name=Wang2016Optimization/&gt; resolution of overlapping linear
sweep voltammetric peaks,&lt;ref name = Wang2016State/&gt; PID controller design,&lt;ref name = Saravanakumar2015Tuning/&gt;&lt;ref name = Saravanakumar2016Lagrangian/&gt; volterra series identification,&lt;ref name = Wang2016Volterra/&gt; and system modeling,&lt;ref name = Xie2016new/&gt; and it is shown that STA is comparable to most existing global optimization methods.

A '''stormwater detention vault''' is an underground structure designed to manage excess [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] on a developed site, often in an urban setting.  This type of [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]] may be selected when there is insufficient space on the site to [[infiltration basin|infiltrate]] the runoff or build a surface facility such as a [[detention basin]] or [[retention basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Transportation.

Detention vaults manage stormwater ''quantity'' flowing to nearby [[surface water]]s. They help prevent [[flood]]ing and can reduce [[erosion#Water|erosion]] in rivers and streams.  They do not provide treatment to improve [[water quality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission|place=Atlanta, GA|url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol2.pdf|title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.

Underground stormwater detention allows for high volume storage of runoff in a small footprint area.  The storage vessels can be made from a variety of materials, including corrugated metal [[pipe (material)|pipe]], aluminum, steel, plastic, fiberglass, [[Precast concrete|pre-cast]] or poured-in-place [[concrete]].&lt;ref name="Duluth"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Duluth, Minnesota|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/stormwater/toolkit/underground.html|title=Tools for Stormwater Management: Underground Storage|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vault is typically buried under a [[parking lot]] or other open land on the site.  In the latter case, this underground vault may be preferable to a surface [[detention pond]] if other uses are intended for the land (e.g. a pedestrian plaza or park).  In other situations, a vault is used because installing a pond might pose other problems, such as attracting unwanted [[waterfowl]] or other animals.  In some sites, a vault may be installed in the basement of a building, such as a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/runoff.pdf|title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: On-Site Underground Retention/Detention|date=September 2001|id=EPA-832-F-01-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be bored to serve as detention vaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wfpl.org/a-sewer-tunnel-and-a-brief-geologic-history-of-louisville/|title=MSD's New Sewer Tunnel Offers A Brief Geologic History Of Louisville|last=Velzer|first=Ryan Van|date=2018-08-15|work=89.3 WFPL News Louisville|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be cheaper than basins, as they do not require pumps to move the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2018/07/30/louisville-msd-cancels-basin-project-near-cherokee-park/862392002/|title=MSD was digging a huge basin near Jim Porter's but has abandoned the plan|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlet is generally a restricted-flow drain from the detention vessel, with a weir for containing detritus.&lt;ref name="Duluth"/&gt; Detention vessels delay water's delivery downstream, and possibly creates a later water level peak post-rainfall.  It is important to consider timing of water release and the types of reservoirs feeding a waterway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol1.pdf | title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual | publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission | date=August 2001 | accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stuttering Equivalence.pdf|thumb|The paths &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'&lt;/math&gt; are stuttering equivalent.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\sim_{st}\pi'&lt;/math&gt;, 

can be seen as a partitioning of path &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'&lt;/math&gt; into blocks, so that states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of one path are labeled (&lt;math&gt;L(\sdot)&lt;/math&gt;) the same as states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of the other path. Corresponding blocks may have different lengths.

Formally, this can be expressed as two infinite paths &lt;math&gt;\pi=s_0, s_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'=r_0, r_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; which are stuttering equivalent (&lt;math&gt;\pi \sim_{st} \pi'&lt;/math&gt;) if there are two infinite sequences of integers &lt;math&gt;0 = i_0 &lt; i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 = j_0 &lt; j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that for every block &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;L(s_{i_k}) = L(s_{i_k+1}) = \ldots = L(s_{i_{k+1}-1}) = L(r_{j_k}) = L(r_{j_k+1}) = \ldots = L(r_{j_{k+1}-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

Stuttering equivalence is not the same as [[bisimulation]], since bisimulation cannot capture the semantics of the 'eventually' (or 'finally') operator found in [[Linear temporal logic|linear temporal]]/[[Computation tree logic|computation tree logic(branching time logic)]]([[modal logic]]). So-called ''branching bisimulation'' has to be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Sustainable design''' (also called environmentally sustainable design,  environmentally conscious design, etc.) is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of [[ecology|ecological]] [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"&gt;McLennan, J. F. (2004), The Philosophy of Sustainable Design&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit}}  Note: Social and economic factors are vitally important considerations, but are sub systems in the larger context of the Earth's eco-sphere. 

==Theory==
The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design".&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"/&gt; Manifestations of sustainable design require [[renewable resources]], impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment.

Great design is sustainable design: Rather than considering green building design as an externality, architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design. This includes better user experience and comfort, doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance, and maximizing the effectives of durable, quality materials. Rather than the well-known edict “form follows function,” it’s time to think “form follows environment.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.edgebuildings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/igen-2016-prashant-kapoor-red.pdf|title=  Architect and Interiors India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. A dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://engagebydesign.org/values/|title=  Sustainable Design Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual problems===

====Diminishing returns====
The principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the [[technology life cycle]] and in the useful life of any system as discussed in [[industrial ecology]] and [[life cycle assessment]].  Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits.  Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity, the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} (see also: [[law of diminishing returns]], [[marginal utility]] and [[Jevons paradox]].)

====Unsustainable investment====
A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], but may lead to a collapse.  This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by [[Joseph Tainter]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;JA Tainter 1988 The Collapse of Complex Societies Cambridge Univ. Press {{ISBN|978-0521386739}}&lt;/ref&gt; This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mayan Empire|Mayan]], among others. Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forest.mtu.edu/info/ecologyseries/Hollings%201973%20resilience.pdf Buzz Holling 1973 Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste prevention====
[[File:Floriade2012Design-GreenestBuildingNL.pdf|thumb|Plans for Floriade 2012 in Venlo, the Netherlands: "The Greenest Building in the Netherlands - no external fuel, electricity, water or sewage."]]
'''Negative Effects of Waste'''

About 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U.K. alone, for example, each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/waste/ Waste and recycling], DEFRA&lt;/ref&gt; And with reference to only household waste, between 1991/92 and 2007/08, each person in England generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1769 Household waste], Office for National Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal. All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment, public health, and local economies. Landfills have contaminated drinking water. Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air, soil, and water. The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology. Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts.

The toxics components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem. In the U.S., about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials, such as [[heavy metals]] like [[nickel]], [[lead]], [[cadmium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from batteries, and [[organic compounds]] found in pesticides and consumer products, such as [[air freshener]] sprays, [[nail polish]], cleaners, and other products.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, "[http://www.epa.gov/ncct/expocast/ Expocast]"&lt;/ref&gt; When burned or buried, toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment.

The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation. Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem. It does not mean doing without, but doing differently. For example, preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages; it just means using refillable bottles.

'''Waste prevention strategies'''
In planning for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste. A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through [[biodegradation]]. This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment. 

Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste &amp;mdash; materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors. The following waste prevention strategies apply to both, although different approaches will be needed for implementation:&lt;ref name=guiding&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch9.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design." Chapter 9: Waste Prevention].&lt;/ref&gt;

* use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic
* compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes
* reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling
* consuming less resources means creating less waste, therefore it reduces the impact on the environment.

===Sustainable design principles===
[[File:CalifAcadamyOfSciAug28-2008img0640.JPG|thumb|290px|The [[California Academy of Sciences]], San Francisco, California, is a sustainable building designed by Renzo Piano. It opened on September 27, 2008]]
[[File:(1)Central building Broadway Sydney-1.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], [[Sydney]]]]

While the practical application varies among disciplines
, some common principles are as follows:
* Low-impact materials: choose non-toxic, sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process
* Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy
* [[Emotionally durable design]]: reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products, through design
* Design for reuse and [[recycling]]: "Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife'."&lt;ref&gt;Anastas, P. L. and Zimmerman, J. B. (2003). "[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es032373g Through the 12 principles of green engineering]". Environmental Science and Technology. March 1. 95-101A.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design impact measures]] for total [[carbon footprint]] and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available.^&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts.  One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of {{convert|8,000|btu|abbr=on}} per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of 0.57&amp;nbsp;kg of CO2 per dollar (1995 dollars US) from DOE figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html US DOE 20 yr Global Product &amp; Energy Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100643/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html |date=2007-06-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sustainable design standards]] and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals.  There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions.
* [[Biomimicry]]: "redesigning industrial systems on biological lines ... enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles..."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hawken, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins (1999). Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution. Little, Brown. {{ISBN|978-0-316-35316-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Service substitution]]: shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions, e.g., from a private automobile to a [[carsharing]] service. Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption (e.g., per trip driven).&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Chris (2006). "Dematerializing Consumption through Service Substitution is a Design Challenge". Journal of Industrial Ecology. 4(1). {{doi|10.1162/108819800569230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Renewable resource]]: materials should come from nearby (local or [[bioregion]]al), sustainably managed renewable sources that can be [[compost]]ed when their usefulness has been exhausted.
* [[Robust eco-design]]: robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I., Katz R. and Bukchin J., "[http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Eco_Design.pdf Robust Eco-Design: A New Application for Quality Engineering]", IIE Transactions, Vol. 40 (10), p. 907 - 918.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill of Rights for the Planet====
A model of the new design principles necessary for [[sustainability]] is exemplified by the "Bill of Rights for the Planet" or "Hannover Principles" -  developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO 2000 that was held in [[Hannover, Germany]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}
:''The Bill of Rights'':
# Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy, supportive, diverse, and sustainable conditions.
# Recognize Interdependence. The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world, with broad and diverse implications at every scale. Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects.
# Respect relationships between spirit and matter. Consider all aspects of human settlement including community, dwelling, industry, and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness.
# Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being, the viability of natural systems, and their right to co-exist.
# Create safe objects of long-term value. Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products, processes, or standards.
# Eliminate the concept of waste. Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes, to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste.
# Rely on natural energy flows. Human designs should, like the living world, derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income. Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use.
# Understand the limitations of design. No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems. Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature. Treat nature as a model and mentor, not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled.
# Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge. Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues, patrons, manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility, and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity.

These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA) in June 1993 at the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Expo 93 in [[Chicago]]. Further, the AIA and UIA signed a "Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future." In summary, the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA, UIA, and their members are committed to:

* Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities
* Developing and continually improving practices, procedures, products, services, and standards for sustainable design
* Educating the building industry, clients, and the general public about the importance of sustainable design
* Working to change policies, regulations, and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice
* Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards.

In addition, the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design (ICED), a coalition of architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering organizations, developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design. ICED states: The ethics, education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future. . . . To achieve this vision we will join . . . as a multidisciplinary partnership."

These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive. The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch1.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Applications of this philosophy range from the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] &amp;mdash; small objects for everyday use, through to the [[macrocosm]] &amp;mdash; buildings, cities, and the Earth's physical surface. It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[engineering]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[fashion design]] and [[human-computer interaction]].

Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global [[environmental crisis|environmental crises]], the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to [[ecosystem]]s, and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="shu-yang"&gt;Fan Shu-Yang, Bill Freedman, and Raymond Cote (2004). "[http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;journal=er&amp;volume=12&amp;calyLang=eng&amp;articleFile=a04-005.pdf Principles and practice of ecological design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160329/http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet |date=2004-08-14 }}". Environmental Reviews. 12: 97–112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, eco architecture writer [[Bridgette Meinhold]] surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book, “Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World.”&lt;ref name=wwnorton&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Bridgette|title=Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Urgent_Architecture.html?id=ib-nuAAACAAJ|publisher=W.

The limits of sustainable design are reducing. Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency. As a result, the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts.  The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services, does not solve this problem. The basic dilemmas include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements; the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones; that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized, but are distributed throughout the economies; and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing.

==Examples==

===Beauty and sustainable design===
Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics, some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration. [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winner [[Frank Gehry]] has called green building "bogus,"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Arndt, "[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2010/04/architect_gehry.html/ Architect Gehry on LEED Buildings: Humbug]", Bloomberg Businessweek, April 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Design Awards]] winner [[Peter Eisenman]] has dismissed it as "having nothing to do with architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curatorialproject.com/interviews/petereisenmanii.html/ Intercontinental Curatorial Project, Interview with Peter Eisenman, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The American Prospect]]'' asked whether "well-designed green architecture" is an "oxymoron."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-195324010/green-building-blues-is-well-designed-green-architecture/ Kriston Capps, "Green Building Blues," ''The American Prospect,'' February 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided. A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect [[Lance Hosey]], whose book ''[[The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design]]'' (2012) was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty. Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful, but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed, creating things of even greater beauty. Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in ''The Shape of Green'' could "revolutionize what it means to be sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderonline.com/design/not-pretty-then-its-not-green_o/|title=Not Pretty? Then It’s Not Green|author=Claire Easley|work=Builder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs. Examples include [[One Central Park]] and the [[Science Faculty building, UTS]].

===Emotionally durable design===

According to [[Jonathan Chapman (academic)|Jonathan Chapman]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], USA, emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of [[natural resources]] by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ‘Design for [Emotional] Durability’, ''Design Issues'', vol xxv, Issue 4, Autumn, pp29-35, 2009 {{doi|10.1162/desi.2009.25.4.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 9/1/15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences &amp; Empathy'', Chapman describes how "the process of consumption is, and has always been, motivated by complex emotional drivers, and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things; it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self, that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment, becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emotionally-Durable-Design-Objects-Experiences/dp/1844071812 Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences and Empathy]'', Earthscan, London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a product requires an attribute, or number of attributes, which extend beyond utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 09/01/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chapman, 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements:
* '''Narrative''': How users share a unique personal history with the product.
* '''Consciousness''': How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will.
* '''Attachment''': Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product?
* '''Fiction''': The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship.
* '''Surface''': How the product ages and develops character through time and use.

As a strategic approach, "emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible, well made, tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term."&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, E. (2009). [http://www.ijdesign.org/ojs/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/571/263 Contemporary ceramic design for meaningful interaction and emotional durability: A case study]. ''International Journal of Design'', 3(2), 87-92&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of [[Parsons The New School for Design]] in New York, “emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users, as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to, and in, design things.”&lt;ref&gt;Clark, H. &amp; Brody, D., Design Studies: A Reader, Berg, New York, US, 2009, p531 {{ISBN|9781847882363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable architecture===
{{Main|Sustainable architecture}}
[[File:Sustainable.jpg|thumb|Sustainable building design]]

Sustainable architecture is the design of [[sustainable building]]s. Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the [[life cycle assessment|lifecycle]] of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; [[alternative energy]] sources such as [[solar hot water]], appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power; [[rainwater harvesting]] for gardening, washing and [[aquifer]] recharge; and on-site [[waste management]] such as [[green roof]]s that filter and control stormwater runoff. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation.&lt;ref name="plainiotis"&gt;Ji Yan and Plainiotis Stellios (2006): Design for Sustainability. Beijing: China Architecture and Building Press. {{ISBN|7-112-08390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable architects design with [[sustainable living]] in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable vs [[green design]] is the challenge that designs not only reflect [[healthy building|healthy]] processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources. A test for sustainable design is &amp;mdash; can the design function for its intended use without [[fossil fuel]] &amp;mdash; unplugged. This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution.  As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested, architects will soon be able to create not only passive, null-emission buildings, but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design.  In 2004 the 59 home housing community, the [[Solar Settlement]], and a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} integrated retail, commercial and residential building, the [[Sonnenschiff|Sun Ship]], were completed by architect [[Rolf Disch]] in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The [[Solar Settlement]] is the first housing community worldwide in which every home, all 59, produce a positive energy balance.&lt;ref name="Rolf Disch Solararchitektur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosting.more-elements.com/MoccaMS/projects/plusenergie/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=266&amp;L=0&amp;host=2|title=Rolf Disch - SolarArchitektur|work=more-elements.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011: "[https://osr.ashrae.org/Public%20Review%20Draft%20Standards%20Lib/Gdl-10P-PPR2-Draft%20_chair-approved-rev_.pdf Interactions Affecting the Achievement of Acceptable Indoor Environments]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=Charter of the New Urbanism|work=cnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable landscape and garden design===
{{Main|Sustainable landscape architecture|Sustainable landscaping|Sustainable gardening}}
'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of sustainable design and [[energy-efficient landscaping]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space. Plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation.
Design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind, using local materials, and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce [[green waste]] hauling but to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[Soil carbon|carbon]] in the [[soil]].

Some designers and gardeners such as [[Beth Chatto]] also use [[drought]]-resistant plants in arid areas ([[xeriscaping]]) and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and [[habitat]]s for [[irrigation]]. Water from building roofs may be collected in [[rain garden]]s so that the [[groundwater]] is recharged, instead of rainfall becoming [[surface runoff]] and increasing the risk of [[flooding]].

Areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage [[bio-diversity]]. Native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways: by plants which provide food such as [[nectar]] and [[pollen]] for insects, or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees, or habitats such as [[pond]]s for [[amphibian]]s and aquatic insects. [[Pesticide]]s, especially [[Chemical pesticides|persistent pesticides]], must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife.

Soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to [[Groundcover|ground-cover plants]] and [[mulch]]es to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[earthworms]] and [[mycorrhiza]]; [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]] instead of [[Nitrogen fertilizer#Inorganic fertilizers (mineral fertilizer)|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]]; and sustainably harvested [[Seaweed#Other uses|seaweed extract]] to replace [[Plant nutrition#Micro-nutrients|micronutrients]].

Sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental, growing food, firewood and craft materials from beautiful places.

Sustainable landscape approaches and labels include [[organic farming]] and [[Organic horticulture|growing]], [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[Forest gardening|forest gardens]], [[agroecology]], [[vegan organic gardening]], ecological gardening and [[climate-friendly gardening]].

===Sustainable agriculture===
:''Main: [[Sustainable agriculture|Organic farming]]
[[Sustainable agriculture]] adheres to three main goals:
*Environmental Health,
*Economic Profitability,
*Social and Economic Equity.
A variety of philosophies, policies and practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture.

There are strenuous discussions &amp;mdash; among others by the [[agricultural]] sector and authorities &amp;mdash; if existing pesticide protocols and methods of [[soil conservation]] adequately protect [[topsoil]] and [[wildlife]]. Doubt has risen if these are sustainable, and if [[organic gardening|agrarian reforms]] would permit an efficient [[agriculture]] with fewer [[pesticide]]s, therefore reducing the damage to the [[ecosystem]].

For more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070421034222/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm "UC Davis: Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program"].&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, G (December 1997).

===Domestic machinery and furniture===
{{Main|Home appliances}}
[[Automobile]]s, [[home appliance]]s and [[furniture]]s can be designed for repair and disassembly (for recycling), and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel, aluminum and glass, and renewable materials, such as [[Zelfo]], [[wood]] and plastics from natural feedstocks. Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-[[sustainable products]]. Even mild design efforts can greatly increase the sustainable content of manufactured items.

====Improvements to heating, cooling, ventilation and water heating====
{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}

* [[Annualized geothermal solar]]
* [[Earth cooling tubes]]
* [[Geothermal heat pump]]
* [[Heat recovery ventilation]]
* [[Hot water heat recycling]]
* [[Passive cooling]]
* [[Renewable heat]]
* [[Seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES)
* [[Solar air conditioning]]
* [[Solar hot water]]
{{div col end}}

===Energy sector===
{{Main|Solar energy|Alternative energy}}
{{See also|Solar thermal collector|Solar panel|Passive solar building design}}
Sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[hydro power|hydro]], [[bioenergy]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], and [[hydrogen]]. Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source; it has been in use for centuries in [[Europe]] and more recently in the [[United States]] and other nations. Wind energy is captured through the use of [[wind turbine]]s that generate and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages. Solar power can be harnessed through [[photovoltaics]], concentrating solar, or [[solar hot water]] and is also a rapidly growing energy source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repp.org/index.html "Renewable Energy Policy Project &amp; CREST Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology"]&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in the technology and modifications to photovoltaics cells provide a more in depth untouched method for creating and producing solar power. Researchers have found a potential way to use the photogalvanic effect to transform sunlight into electric energy. &lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.022 "Solar energy conversion and storage: Rhodamine B - Fructose photogalvanic cell"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability, potential, and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan. The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to [[sustainable development]] and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch7.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". Chapter 7: Energy Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for sustainable manufacturing===
Sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability. The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]] in order to condition the related [[sustainability]] on [[product life cycle]] and Factory operations.
* Designing sustainable production systems imply, on the one hand, the analysis and optimization of intra-factory aspects that are related to [[manufacturing plants]]. Such aspects can regard the [[resource consumption]] restrain, the  process [[efficiency]], the [[ergonomics]] for the factory workers, the elimination of [[hazardous substances]], the minimization of factory emissions and waste as well as internal emissions, the integrated management of information in the production facilities, and the technological updating of machines and plants.
* Other inter-factories aspects concern the sustainable design of manufactured products, product chain [[Dematerialization (products)|dematerialisation]], management of the background and foreground [[supply chains]], support of [[circular economy]] paradigm, and the [[labelling]] for sustainability.

===Water sector===
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Rainwater harvesting|Stormwater harvesting}}
[[File:Rain Water storage.JPG|thumb|A 35,003 litre rainwater harvesting tank in [[Kerala]]]]

Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner.

Beyond the use of certain technologies, Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts. Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption, that is not necessarily for drinking purposes, is of potable water quality. This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called "fit-for-purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|title=Water recycling &amp; alternative water sources|work=health.vic.gov.au|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107231100/http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|archivedate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This more rational use of water achieves several economies, that are not only related to water itself, but also the consumption of energy, as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons.

==Terminology==
In some countries the term ''sustainable design'' is known as [[ecodesign]], [[green design]] or [[environmental design]]. [[Victor Papanek]], embraced [[social design]] and social quality and ecological quality, but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term. ''Sustainable design'' and ''design for sustainability'' are more common terms, including the [[triple bottom line]] (people, planet and profit).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the EU, the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign. Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the [[circular economy]] package, that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of 2015. To this effect, an Ecothis.EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ecothis.eu campaign website|url=http://www.ecothis.eu|publisher=ecothis.eu|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable technologies==
Sustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/sustainability-theme1/sustainable-roadmap |title=Sustainable Roadmap - Open Innovation |first= |last= |work=connect.innovateuk.org |year=2012 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant overlap with [[appropriate technology]], which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. However, the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an "appropriate technology," as that term is commonly used.

The TAOS telescopes are located in [[Taiwan]], at the [[Lulin Observatory]] in [[Yushan National Park]].

TAOS is a joint effort of the [[Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, [[National Central University]], Institute of Astronomy and [[Yonsei University]], South Korea.

Currently, an expansion to the TAOS project is being planned called TAOS II, with a new meaning to the acronym, the Transneptunian Automated Occultation Survey. The data volume is expected to be over 300 terabytes per year.

The '''United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence''' (USAICoE) is the [[United States Army]]'s school for professional training of [[military intelligence]] personnel.  It is a component of [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]].

==History==
The center was relocated from [[Fort Holabird|Ft. Holabird]], Maryland to [[Fort Huachuca, Arizona]] in 1971. The move involved more than 120 moving vans, a unit train and several aircraft.  The initial intelligence training facilities were a [[World War II]] hospital complex that had not been occupied in several years.

==Training==
The school conducts resident courses for [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]], [[warrant officer]], and [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] personnel, as well as for international military students in military exchange programs.  United States Army personnel who train at the school become members of the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)#Military Intelligence Corps|Military Intelligence Corps]].

'''Visual arts education''' is the area of learning that is based upon only the kind of art that one can see, [[visual arts]]—[[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], and design in [[jewelry]], [[pottery]], [[weaving]], [[fabrics]], etc. and design applied to more practical fields such as commercial graphics and home furnishings. Contemporary topics include [[photography]], [[video]], [[film]], [[design]], and [[computer art]].  Art education may focus on students creating art, on learning to criticize or appreciate art, or some combination of the two.

Art is often taught through [[drawing]], an empirical activity which involves seeing, interpreting and discovering appropriate marks to reproduce an observed phenomenon. Drawing instruction has been a component of formal education in the West since the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Art Education|page= 177

An alternative approach to art education involves an emphasis on imagination, both in interpreting and creating art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research and Policy in Art Education|page=769

Prominent curricular models for art education include:
*A sixfold model divided into "Creative-Productive, Cultural-Historical and Critical-Responsive” components in some provinces of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Drawing to Visual Culture: A History of Art Education in Canada

|first=Harold |last=Pearse |year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Discipline Based Art Education (DBAE) came to favor in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and it focused on specific skills including techniques, art criticism and art history. Heavily backed by the [[Getty Education Institute for the Arts]], DBAE faded after the Institute ceased funding in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curriculum Studies Handbook – The Next Moment

|first=Erik |last=Malewski |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Teaching for Artistic Behavior (TAB) is a choice-based model that began in the 1970s in Massachusetts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teachingforartisticbehavior.org/|title=Teaching for Artistic Behavior|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAB suggests that students should be the artists and be guided on their own individual artistic interests.

In addition, especially in higher education in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] tradition, art is often taught as "art appreciation", a subject for [[aesthetic]] criticism rather than direct engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Issues in Competency Based Education|page= 10

|first1=Susan V. |last1=Monjan|first2=Suzanne M. |last2=Gassner |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies show that strong art education programs have demonstrated increased student performance in other academic areas, due to art activities' exercising their brains' right hemispheres and delateralizing their thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jensen |first= Eric|title= Arts with the Brain in Mind |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |location= Alexandria, Virginia |isbn= 0-87120-514-9 |pages= 57–58, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also see [[Betty Edwards]]' ''[[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain]]''.

Art education is not limited to formal educational institutions. Some professional artists provide private or semi-private instruction in their own studios. This may take the form of an [[apprenticeship]] in which the student learns from a professional artist while assisting the artist with their work.  One form of this teaching style is the [[Atelier Method]] as exemplified by [[Gustave Moreau]] who taught Picasso, Braque and many other artists.{{sfn|Efland|1990|pp=52-53}}

===Apprenticeship===
[[File:Sweerts, Michael - The Drawing Class - 1656-58.jpg|thumb|''The Drawing Class'', by [[Michiel Sweerts]], c. 1656]]
Historically art was taught in Europe via the [[atelier method]] system&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatelier.org/ Atelier instruction]&lt;/ref&gt; where artists took on apprentices who learned their trade in much the same way as that of [[trade guild|guilds]] such as the [[stonemason]]s or [[goldsmith]]s. During their free time formal training took place in art workshops or, more often, in homes or alone outside. It was in these ateliers that artists learned the craft through apprenticeship to masters, a relationship that was controlled by guild statutes. Florentine contracts dating from the late 13th century state that the master was expected to clothe and feed the apprentice, who was called upon to be a faithful servant in return. An apprentice often paid the master during the early years of his education; assuming the apprenticeship was productive, the student would be compensated later in his training. Northern European workshops featured similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, Jill, et al. ''Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery'', 136. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1991. {{ISBN|0-300-05070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, learning to draw was a priority in this system. [[Michelangelo]] recommended that a young painter spend a year on drawing alone, then six years grinding colors, preparing panels and using gold leaf, during which time the study of drawing would continue. Another six years would be required to master fresco and tempera painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, Jill, et al. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, design has had some precedence over the [[fine arts]] with [[design school|schools of design]] being established all over Europe in the 18th century. These examples of skill and values from the early European art inspired later generations, including the Colonists of early America.

===Cultural appropriation within the classroom===

Individuals who employ cultural appropriation have the ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit.&lt;ref&gt;James O. Young, “Art, Authenticity and Appropriation” Front. Philos. China (2006) 3:455–476 (2006): 456, accessed October 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11466-006-0019-2&lt;/ref&gt; Using properties of art from different cultures such as decoration or emulation of creative process can foster a greater understanding and appreciation of crafts from different cultures. This technique can be appreciated in the production of African or Native-American mask making projects, where students emulate technique and explore new material use and construction methods which esteem those practices of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Manley Delacruz, “Approaches to Multiculturalism in Art Education Curriculum Products: Business as Usual” Journal of Aesthetic Education(1996): 85 Accessed November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Argentina===
Leading country in the development of the arts in [[Latin America]], in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters [[Eduardo Schiaffino]], [[Eduardo Sívori]], and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]], as a department in the [[University of Buenos Aires]], the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the [[Universidad Nacional de las Artes|UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes]]&lt;ref&gt;Institutional Transformation IUNA - Law 24.521, Ministry of Justice &amp; Education, Argentina (text in Spanish) / http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/40779/norma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Australia===

Australian Universities which have Visual / Fine Art departments or courses within their institutions have moved from Studio Based teaching models, associated with Art Schools, to more integrated theoretical / practical emphasis.  University of Western Australia has moved from a master's degree with theoretical emphasis to a theoretical BA Art degree.

Studio based teaching initiatives integrating contextual and media elements have been implemented as part of a national Studio Teaching Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studioteaching.org/ Studio Teaching Project]&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) since 2007.

===Egypt===

The first modern art school in Egypt was opened in 1908 as the Cairo College of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|title=Creative Reckonings: The Politics of Art and Culture in Contemporary Egypt|page=315
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0804754772|isbn=0804754772
|first=Jessica |last=Winegar |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early art schools largely taught the Western aesthetic traditions.  As a result, after independence there was an effort to incorporate Egyptian and Middle Eastern traditions into art and art appreciation courses.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}} However, the process was slow; students at Cairo College of Fine Arts were not able to major in non-European art history until 1999.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}}

===Italy===
[[Art school]]s were established in Italy as early as the 13th century, starting with a painting school in Venice founded by a Greek painter named Theophanes around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Byzantine Art and Culture in Rome and Italy|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|year=1895|volume=10|first=A.L.|last=Frothingham|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch Art Teachers Association (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs) was founded in 1880 and began to publish a monthly magazine in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gahetna.nl/collectie/archief/pdf/NL-HaNA_2.19.072.01.ead.pdf |publisher=Nationaal Archief|title=Inventaris van het archief van de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs, 1880-1994|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late 20th century, the growing diversity of Dutch society has made Dutch art and art education increasingly [[multicultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Amsterdam: Immigrants and Urban Change in the Twentieth Century|page=112
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9089641688|isbn=9089641688
|first1=Liza |last1=Nell|first2=Jan|last2=Rath |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Formal art education emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, motivated in part by a desire to match the quality of design work being done in France.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}}  The model initially adopted was that of the German commercial schools.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}} [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] was particularly influential in the creation of schools of Art in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Philosophy of Art Education

|first=Stuart |last=Macdonald|year=2004|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the UK, the art curriculum is prescribed by the government's [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] except in [[public school (United Kingdom)|public]] or fee paying schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-art-and-design-programmes-of-study|title=National curriculum in England: art and design programmes of study|date=2013-09-11|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prince Charles]] has created [[The Prince's Drawing School]] in [[Hoxton]] to preserve the teaching of academic drawing.

===United States===

The study of art appreciation in America began with the Artists of Today Movement in the late 19th century and began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48–54].&lt;/ref&gt; The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

American [[Philosophy of education|educational philosopher]] and [[school reform]]er [[John Dewey]] was influential in broadening access to art education in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Since [[World War II]], artist training has moved to elementary schools, and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not usually need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, facilitated by the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], [[Black Mountain College]], or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]]; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had become one of the first art academies.&lt;ref&gt;"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This trend spread from the United States around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Enrollment in art classes at the high school level peaked in the late 1960s—early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  With [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB){{when|date=April 2012}} (which retains the arts as part of the "daily life", but does not require reporting or assessment data on this area) there has been additional decline of arts education in American public schools.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[United States Department of Education]] now awards Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula. After 2010, an estimate of 25% of the nation's public high schools will end all art programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Various "ed-tech" companies like [[Kadenze]] and [[edX]] have attempted to mitigate this loss through online arts education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/art-schools-go-mooc-new-online-platform-works-with-art-programs-at-18-colleges/56947 Art Schools Go MOOC, With A New Online Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

National organizations promoting arts education include Americans for the Arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/artseducation Americans for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Art. Ask For More.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/Public_awareness ''Art. Ask For More.'']&lt;/ref&gt; its national arts education public awareness campaign; Association for the Advancement of Arts Education; Arts Education Partnership.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org Arts Education Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional organizations for art educators include the [[National Art Education Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naea-reston.org the National Art Education Association]&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes the practitioner-friendly journal ''Art Education'' and the research journal ''Studies in Art Education''; USSEA (the [[United States Society for Education through Art]]) and InSEA (the International Society for Education through Art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insea.org/ |title=International Society for Education through Art |work=InSEA.org |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Education through the visual arts is an important and effective influence in allowing students, from an early age, to comprehend and implement the foundational democratic process emphasized within the United States societal structure.&lt;ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude"&gt;Gude, Olivia. [http://www.arteducators.org/research/2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude.pdf "Art Education for Democratic Life"]. Lowenfeld Lecture 2009. National Art Education Association. Minnesota, Minneapolis. 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivia Gude]], the 2009 recipient of the National Art Education Association’s Lowenfeld Lecture Scholarship, spoke about the numerous ways in which art education is instrumental in forming an informed self- and world-aware citizen. She asserts that:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Through art education, students develop enhanced skills for understanding the meaning making of others. Through quality art education, youth develop the capacity to learn several jobs much easier than others. Most significantly, engagement with the arts teaches youth to perceive complexity as pleasure and possibility, not as irritating uncertainty. Heightened self-awareness is extended to heightened awareness of others . . .&lt;ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Special education==

Art education was combined with special education even before there were reforms to create special accommodations for children with special needs in typical classrooms.  When it comes to art, [[art therapist]]s are often used to connect with students with special needs. However, some art therapists pull students out of the classroom, causing them to fall behind in their other schoolwork such as math, English, and science. Because of this, art therapy is reserved for students who do not have much chance for long-term improvements, but rather short-term developmental skills, or for those who seek to increase their all-round capabilities.&lt;ref name="vanmeter"&gt;Van Meter, M. L. (2010.). "[http://www.arttherapy.org/upload/toolkitspecialeducation.pdf Art therapy and special education]" (PDF). Retrieved  November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special educator Jean Lokerson and art educator [[Amelia Jones]] wrote that “the art room is a place where learning disabilities can turn into learning assets.” Special needs students often come out of their shells and get enthusiastic about creating. Art is also a way that special educators teach their students fundamentals that they may not even realize.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, B. (2011). "[http://www.arteducators.org/research/resource-library/2011_NAEA_Lowenfeld_Lecture.pdf Art education and special education: A promising partnership]" (PDF). Paper presented at 2011 National Art Education Association national convention, Seattle, WA. Retrieved November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing studies that continue to prove that art and special education go hand in hand. Testing continues to prove that art in any classroom, but especially special education classrooms causes students to be motivated, enthusiastic, and in some cases, even promote learning in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Iwai, K. (2002). "The contribution of arts education to children's lives". ''Prospects'', 32(4), 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current trends in theory and scholarship ==
The domain of art education is broadening to include a wider range of visual and popular culture.  Current trends in scholarship employ postmodern and visual culture approaches to art education,&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, K. (2003). Teaching visual culture. New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncum, P. (2006). (Ed.). Visual culture in the art class: Case studies. Reston, VA: National Art Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; consider effects of [[globalism]] on the production and interpretation of images&lt;ref name="delacruz2009"&gt;Delacruz, E., Arnold, A., Kuo, A., &amp; Parson, M.
