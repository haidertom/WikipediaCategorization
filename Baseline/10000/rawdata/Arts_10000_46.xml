==Early life==
He was educated at the [[Lawrence Sheriff School]] in Rugby and later on a scholarship at [[Rugby School]] and read History at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], gaining a first-class Honours degree. He was a columnist for the newsletter of the [[Cambridge University Social Democrats]] during 1982–83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keynessociety.wordpress.com/about-the-keynes-society/ |title=About us &amp;#124; Keynes Society |publisher=Keynessociety.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also editor of ''Stop Press'', the Cambridge University newspaper of the day, and won the Guardian Student Journalist of the year award in 1984.

==Career==

===Newspapers===
Rawnsley began his career at the [[BBC]], working there for two years from 1983, but joined ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1985. From 1987 he was the newspaper's parliamentary sketch writer.

In 1993 he moved to ''[[The Observer]]'' as Chief Political Commentator and Associate Editor, a position he retains. He has won several awards for his journalism, including: British Press Awards Young Journalist of the Year (1987); What The Papers Say Columnist of the Year (2000); Channel 4 Political Awards Book of the Year (2001); Channel 4 Political Awards Journalist of the Year (2003); House Magazine Awards Commentator of the Year (2008); Chair's Choice Award at the Editorial Intelligence Comment Awards (2015) for combining "excellent insight with an originality and power of expression which makes him sans pareil in his field".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsworks.org.uk/news-and-Opinion/winners-of-the-comment-awards-2015-announced&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
Rawnsley has also broadcast regularly; he was co-presenter of [[Channel 4|Channel 4's]] ''A Week in Politics'' with [[Vincent Hanna]]. He continues to be the writer-presenter of one-off documentaries for [[Channel 4]]. He made ''Bye Bye Blues'', a three part series about John Major's Government, in 1997. That was followed by ''Blair's Year'' (1998). His three-hour series ''The Rise And Fall Of Tony Blair'' (2007) was long-listed for a [[BAFTA]] award. Rawnsley has written and presented a series of programmes on British politics, broadcast on Channel 4's current affairs series, ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'': ''Gordon Brown: Where Did It All Go Wrong?''

The '''Australian International Design Awards''' is an industry body established by the [[Industrial Design Council of Australia]] (IDCA), founded in 1958. The awards are [[Australia|Australia's]] only national design awards for [[industrial design]]. Since 1991, the Australian International Design Awards has been a division of [[Standards Australia]].

In 2007 the Australian Design Awards expanded its entry criteria to include all professionally designed products on the Australian market, including products designed in Australia. From 2007, the Australian Design Awards became known as the Australian International Design Awards to reflect the global nature of the awards.

The Australian International Design Awards has been recognised by the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] and the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsid.org ICSID] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906041307/http://www.icsid.org/ |date=6 September 2009 }}.org&lt;/ref&gt; as a promotional body for the Australian design industry.

== Awards ==
There are three types of accolades issued by the Australian International Design Awards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/accolades.jsp Designawards.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912113443/http://designawards.com.au/accolades.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are:
* Australian International Design Mark (recognising Good Design)
* Australian International Design Award (recognising Design Excellence)
* Australian International Design Award of the Year (recognising the best product of the year)

Special Awards include:
* Award for Excellence in Sustainable Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/sustainable_design.jsp Sustainable design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912140502/http://designawards.com.au/sustainable_design.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
In 1958 the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA) was established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=362218|title=Industrial Design Council of Australia Archive|website=www.powerhousemuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  funded by the Commonwealth Government. The goal was to educate [[Manufacturer|manufacturers]] and consumers on the value of design, encourage and promote high standards of design in [[Manufacturing|manufactured]] goods.

From 1964 Good Design Labels began to appear on products and the Australian Design Index became a register of the best designed products in Australia. A panel of experts reviewed items for inclusion in the Index. Products meeting the criteria received the Good Design Label and other manufacturers were given constructive criticism on how to improve their products.

In 1964, the IDCA opened the first Australian Design Centre in [[Melbourne]] with a special exhibition of selected products from the Australian Design Index. Federal and state government funding helped establish a new Design Centre in [[Sydney]], with more centres to follow in other cities. 

In 1967 the Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design was set up, supported by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with the aim of promoting greater awareness of good design in Australian [[engineering]]. The inaugural Prince Philip Prize was awarded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Ian|title=Prince Philip Prize - STILL Winners|url=http://ianwongresearch.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/prince-phillip-design-prize-still.html|website=Industrial Design in Victoria|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90 entries were received and the winning entry was a self-propelled grain header, designed by Kenneth Gibson. The Prince Philip Prize continued for twenty years.

The IDCA faced funding difficulties in the mid-1970s and was forced to close temporarily in 1976. A new funding injection from the Commonwealth Government helped the Council reopen and a new 'innovation' recognition program was introduced.

Recognising not only high quality but innovative Australian designed products, the Australian Design Award (ADA) program became a valuable promotional tool for manufacturers and designers and provided a source of revenue for the IDCA to continue its operations. The Prince Philip Prize continued to be awarded, but only to products which had received the ADA.

During this time, publicity was at an all-time high. Televised coverage of the Awards presentation on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] reached audiences of over four million and in 1979, the first annual yearbook of ADA winners was published. 

For the next two decades, however, continuing funding issues, dwindling industry support and a lack of clear direction plagued the IDCA. In 1987 in an effort to reinvigorate the movement, the government re-launched the IDCA as the Australian Design Council and the Prince Philip Prize was folded, leaving the ADA as Australia's top design accolade.

In 1991, control of the Australian Design Council and the ADA program moved to [[Standards Australia]]. Under Standards Australia, the ADA program continued to run, but the Australian Design Council was disbanded in 1993. New formats and incentives for the ADA program such as the Australian Design Mark certification scheme were trialled during the second half of the '90s without success. In 1997 a revamped format was introduced to the Awards, using an online application form and first round internet shortlisting. It attracted more than one hundred applications. The first Presentation Night was held at the [[The Metro Theatre|Metro Theatre]] in Sydney. In 1998, profession-based categories were introduced.

However, the program was threatened by significant [[operating costs]]. The 1999 program was put on hold while Standards Australia explored other options to secure the future of the awards. The majority of staff was made redundant and for the first time in many years, no Design Awards were presented in Australia. The Design Institute of Australia was approached to take over the program but the financial commitment to posed too great a risk. 

Armed with a new business plan and financial model, the Board of Standards Australia approved another year for the awards. For the next few years, the ADA continued to grow in standing and support, buoyed by financial stability. A student design category was launched in 2002 supported by [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Appliances]] Australia and in 2004, product-focused categories were introduced.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of rewarding design and innovation excellence in Australia, internationally designed products available for sale in Australia were allowed to enter the awards for the first time. This bold move was aimed at raising the stakes for good design once again, allowing Australian design to be benchmarked against the best in the world. With the ongoing support of the design industry and Standards Australia, this opens the door to the next chapter in the history of the Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp 50 Year Retrospective of the Australian International Design Awards 1958–2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003130032/http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster''''' (1648) is a group portrait [[oil painting]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is considered one of the highlights of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], though it is generally on show in the [[Rijksmuseum]].

The painting is one of the largest civic guard group portraits for which most of the sitters are known and most of the portrayed objects have survived.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The painting is about retiring from active duty, because the [[Peace of Münster]] had finally been signed after years of negotiations. The main figures are seen with the attributes of the civic guard guilds.

The art historian J.J. de Gelder mentioned the painting is dated 1648 but was probably finished at least a year later, similar to the way other group portraits by Van der Helst bear the date of the commission and not of completion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bartholomeusvand00gelduoft#page/65 J.J. de Gelder, dissertation on Bartholomeus van der Helst with a monograph of his work, 1921, cat. nr. 836]&lt;/ref&gt; The drum explains the occasion by way of the poem attached to it by [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]]. The names mentioned in the poem are the handshakers, but in 1680 a name board was added that included 24 names:

The art historian Judith van Gent remarked that the first name on this list was Hendrik Caliber who was buried a month after the festivities took place, and agrees with De Gelder that the painting took quite a while to create and assumes the commission probably was granted well before the summer of 1648. In her catalog entry for this painting she lists short biographies of the traceable names.

During the six-month run of an issue, additional content appears as "featured" content.  Previous issues are archived online in their entirety.&lt;ref name=Georgetown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.georgetown.edu/newjour/b/msg02983.html |title=Blackbird: an Online Journal of Literature and the Arts |publisher=Library.georgetown.edu |date=2004-12-29 |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827124108/http://library.georgetown.edu/newjour/b/msg02983.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Blackbird'' publishes fiction, poetry, plays, interviews, reviews, and art by both new and established writers and artists.  The journal frequently includes streaming audio and video content, including readings, interviews, and art lectures.&lt;ref name=Georgetown/&gt;  Each fall issue forefronts work by, and about, the late [[Larry Levis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v7n2/features/levis_remembered/intro.htm |title=Larry Levis Remembered Reading Loop Introduction, Blackbird |publisher=Blackbird.vcu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/385 |title=Larry Levis- Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios &amp; More |publisher=Poets.org |date=1946-09-30 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal's reading period for poetry and fiction closes between April 15 and September 15.  Unsolicited reviews, plays, and art work are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v7n2/submissions.htm |title=Blackbird Submissions Guidelines, v7n2 |publisher=Blackbird.vcu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publisher ==
''Blackbird'' is published jointly by the Creative Writing Program of the Department of English at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in partnership with New Virginia Review, Inc., a [[nonprofit]] literary arts organization based in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Georgetown/&gt; Its founding editors included Gregory Donovan, Mary Flinn, William Tester, M.A. Keller and Jeff Lodge. The journal is staffed by employees of the two sponsoring organizations as well as by interns and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/eng/resources/blackbird.htm |title=Blackbird, VCU Department of English |publisher=Has.vcu.edu |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
''Blackbird'' was one of the first literary journals to be included in the [[LOCKSS]] international archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Content_Releases_Archive |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124042913/http://lockss.org/lockss/Content_Releases_Archive |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blackbird'' received AP Wire coverage for its publication of a previously unpublished sonnet of [[Sylvia Plath]] in their Fall 2006 issue.  Entitled ''Ennui,'' the poem was composed during Plath's early years at [[Smith College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/31/news |title=Unpublished Plath sonnet goes online tomorrow &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-10-31|accessdate=2012-01-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/31/AR2006103100411.html |title=Student Finds Unpublished Plath Poem |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Antonucci, in the ''[[Library Journal]]'', describes ''Blackbird'' it as "one of the most successful, well-assembled online literary magazines available... it is graphically attractive and has attracted writers of stature such as . . . Reginald Shepherd and [[Gerald Stern]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA405420.html |title=Collection Development "Poetry": A Rhyme a Day |publisher=Libraryjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">The '''Breac Maodhóg''' is a house-shaped Irish [[reliquary]], today in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. It is thought to date from the second half of the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Medieval-Ireland-1150-1550 Medieval Ireland 1150-1550]". National Museum of Ireland. Retrieved 6 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; although periods as early as the 9th century have been proposed, the later dating is believed more likely based on the style of its decoration.&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt; The shrine is made from large plates of bronze on a wooden base, on which are placed series of [[relief]] figures on bronze plaques. At a height of 190mm and width of 92mm, it is relatively large compared to similar objects of its type.&lt;ref name="gm136"&gt;Murray (2005), 136&lt;/ref&gt; It was for centuries kept in a small decorated leather satchel, which was slightly too small for the shrine and is thought to have been designed to hold a manuscript.&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt;


House-shaped reliquaries date back to at least the 8th century. The figures in the Breac Maodhóg are made from bronze, but so finely [[Molding (process)|moulded]] that they resemble [[wood carving]]s.&lt;ref name="ot86"&gt;O'Toole (2013), 86&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly [[cleric]]s, saints and [[apostles]], they are placed in groupings, some of which are now lost or badly damaged. The surviving figures are given highly individualistic facial feature, expressions and poses. They wear elaborate hairstyles&lt;ref&gt;Laing (2006), 144&lt;/ref&gt; and are dressed in luxurious finery, and the folds of their flowing robes are highly detailed.&lt;ref name="ot86" /&gt;

The most well known figures (pictured above) are of two saints or clerics on the right hand side of the middle register. The saint on the left has a melancholy expression, drooping eyes, and holds his head in one hand, as if sighing. The musician on one side of the front-plate is playing what is thought to be the oldest extant visual representation of a [[harp]].&lt;ref name="ot86" /&gt;

The Breac Maodhóg was thought in the early modern period to have originated at [[Drumlane]] monastery, [[County Cavan]], however its first mentioned, in a 15th century "Life of the saint", describes its donation to the village of [[Rossinver]], [[County Leitrim]] by the Bishop [[Máedóc of Ferns]].&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt; Its provenance for many centuries is unclear, one account notes that the shrine was "preserved for centuries in Drumlane, and was stolen in the present century from the Roman Catholic priest of that parish".&lt;ref name="gm137"&gt;Murray (2005), 137&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Burial of Saint Lucy''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Caravaggio]]. It is located in the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia located on the Piazza Duomo in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]].

==History==
According to ''[[The Golden Legend]]'', [[Saint Lucy]] had bestowed her wealth on the poor, in gratitude for the miraculous healing of her mother. Denounced as a Christian, she refused to recant, offered her chastity to Christ, and was sentenced to be dragged to a brothel. Miraculously, nothing could move her from the spot where she stood. She was pierced by a knife in the throat and, where she fell, the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse was built.&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Helen|title=Caravaggio: A Life|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813337944|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caravaggio.html?id=PHwNAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio had escaped from prison on Malta in 1608, fleeing to Syracuse. There his Roman companion [[Mario Minniti]] helped him get a commission for the present altarpiece. Caravaggio painted it in 1608, for the Franciscan church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro. The choice of subject was driven by the fact that St. Lucy was the patron saint of Syracuse and had been interred below the church.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was unusual, but especially important to the local authorities, who were eager to reinforce the local cult of St. Lucy, which had sustained a setback with the theft of her remains during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham-Dixon|first=Andrew|title=Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780241954645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lI76naiYuMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists''''' was written by Ambassador [[Jean Kennedy Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= JFK's sister Jean Kennedy Smith reflects |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-09-26-jfk-jean-kennedy-smith_N.htm |date=26 September 2010| author= USA TODAY|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Last Kennedy: Jean Kennedy Smith |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TedKennedy/jean-kennedy-smith-kennedy/story?id=8421544 |date=26 August 2009| author= ABC World News with Diane Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Plimpton]] (co-founder of the [[Paris Review]]) and published by [[Random House]] in April 1993. In 1974, Smith founded [[Very Special Arts]], an educational affiliate of the [[Kennedy Center]] that provides opportunities in the creative arts for persons with disabilities in the United States and around the world. In February 2011, President Obama awarded her the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/17/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients |date=15 February 2011|author= White House Office of the Press Secretary}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nation’s highest civilian honor, for her work with people with disabilities.

The 272 page book profiles 16 artists with disabilities who discuss how art has made a difference in their lives despite their unique challenges. Artists include [[Chuck Close]], [[Mark Di Suvero]], [[Jack Hofsiss]], [[Tony Meléndez]], [[Howie Seago]] and [[Randy Souders]].&lt;ref&gt;Table of Contents| http://catalog.library.sebts.edu/vufind/Record/42550/TOC| The Library at Southeastern}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes a "disability awareness guide," a list of disability organizations and other resources.

The '''Church of St. Lawrence''' ({{lang-fi|Vantaan Pyhän Laurin kirkko}}; {{lang-sv|Helsinge kyrka S:t Lars}}) is a church in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]]. 
Dating back to ca. 1450, it is the oldest building in Vantaa and all of [[Greater Helsinki]].&lt;ref name="VS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/pyhan-laurin-kirkko |title=Pyhän Laurin kirkko |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Vantaan Seurakunnat |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat |language=Finnish |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the main church of the Tikkurila Parish. Along with its surrounding neighborhood, the church is a part of the [[Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä]] [[Districts of Vantaa|district]], which is one of the best preserved historical [[parish]]es in all of Finland.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The Church of St. Lawrence was partially destroyed in a fire on 7 May 1893,&lt;ref name="Knapas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knapas |first=Marja Terttu |date= |title= Vantaan Pyhän Laurin kirkko 500. Tutkielmia kirkon historiasta. |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat. |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was reconstructed in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

==History==
The Church of St. Lawrence was built around the year 1450, though records suggest that a wooden equivalent stood in its position as early as 1401.&lt;ref name="VSen"/&gt; Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the introduction of [[Lutheranism]] into Finland, the church served the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It was built as the church of Helsinki Parish, well before [[Helsinki]], the city, was founded in 1550. The parish village with its church was favorably located on a coastal road between [[Turku]] and [[Vyborg]]. A branch of the [[salmon]]-rich [[River Vantaa]] ran through the village as well.&lt;ref name="VSen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/en/saintlawrence/ |title=The Church of St. Lawrence |author= |website=Vantaan Seurakunnat |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat |access-date=30 April 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411023957/http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/en/saintlawrence/ |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burning of 1893===
On 7 May 1893, the church was largely destroyed by a [[conflagration]], leaving behind only its stone walls and [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]. Reconstruction was overseen by the renowned Finnish architect Theodor Höijer, who opted to alter the appearance of the church by increasing the sizes of its windows and tending toward a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style. The reconstruction, or as it was referred to, the restoration, was influenced by the cultural context of the late 1800s, during which [[Medieval architecture]] was gaining newfound respect in Finland.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The church was reopened in 1894, marking the then-believed 400 year anniversary of the building. More recently, the church has been recognized as older, by at least 50 years.

==Exterior==
The [[Facade|façade]] of the church is reminiscent of other Finnish medieval churches, such as the [[Porvoo Cathedral]]. The reason for the similarity is that many churches from that time period in southern Finland were designed by the same person, the anonymous ''Pernajan mestari'', who is presumed to be a German architect. The church has, however, been redesigned to some extent following the fire of 1893, leading to the current design being a mixture of [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] architecture.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The façade features a biblical excerpt (from Psalms 84:10) in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "''En dag i dina gårdar är bättre än eljest de tusende''" ({{lang-en|"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere"}}).

The roof of the church, prior to the fire, was a tarred [[Wood shingle#Shakes|shake wood shingle]] roof. After the reconstruction, it was made into a [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|copper roof]].&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt;
[[File:Vantaa church bell tower.jpg|thumb|left|The [[bell tower]].]]

===Bell tower===
The Church of St. Lawrence has an external [[bell tower]] located next to the front of the building. It was completely destroyed in 1893 and rebuilt in a style similar to the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style of the church building. The tower has two bells, and its roof is peaked by a [[flèche]] with a [[cockerel]] [[weather vane]].&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

===Graveyard===
[[File:Cronsted crave.JPG|thumb|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]].]]
The church is surrounded by a graveyard, which acts as the primary graveyard for the parishes of Vantaa. Up until 1793, the graveyard remained constrained to its original size, until an inspection deemed it too crowded. Since then, it has been regularly expanded to suit the needs of the growing population. The graveyard's current area is about {{convert|10|ha}}. Its most notable grave is the [[mausoleum]] of Swedish naval commander [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]].&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/matkailu/kotimaa/matkakohteet.shtml/652704?uusimaa |title=Pyhän Laurin kirkko on Suomen suosituin vihkipaikka |last=Halonen |first=Antti |date=1 June 2008 |website=mtv3.fi |publisher=MTV MEDIA |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515054505/http://www.mtv3.fi/matkailu/kotimaa/matkakohteet.shtml/652704?uusimaa |archive-date= 15 May 2011 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
Prior to the fire of 1893, the church interior remained largely unchanged throughout the centuries. One change that took place was the treating of the inner walls with [[chalk]]; in the Middle Ages, the walls were decorated with Medieval paintings, but by the 18th century, the walls were chalked white. The fire revealed several pre-Reformation paintings on the church [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], though contemporaries deemed the paintings artistically worthless and "primitive". Before being painted over again, the art historian Emil Nervander made replica paintings of them, which are currently stored by the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]].&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The main [[stained glass]] window of the church was completed after the 1893 fire. It depicts [[Jesus]] comforting a [[pilgrim]].

In 1853, the church received its first [[pipe organ]]. Though destroyed in 1893, the replacement organ replicated the visual appearance of the original. It was adapted for electrical power in the 1930s. The current organ was built in 1976, though it adapts the front of the 1800s design for visual similarity.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;

'''''Crime Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated panels of typography with panels of illustrations. Thus, it was arranged in tiers like a comic book but eliminated hand-lettering, balloons and panel borders.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955. ''Crime Illustrated'' ran for a total of two issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, they had no choice but to cancel them.

==Writers==
The editor of ''Crime Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of this title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote using the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and Alfred E. Neuman. In a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]], Feldstein included retellings of previous stories: the first issue's "Fall Guy for Murder" and "Mother's Day", and the second issue's "Screenplay for Murder" and "Pieces of Hate". Writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had contributed to EC's earlier publications), Richard Smith and John Larner.

==Artists==
Artists featured in ''Crime Illustrated'' include [[Joe Orlando]], [[Bernard Krigstein]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Johnny Craig]].

==Reprints==
''Crime Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in 2006 as part of his ''Complete EC Library''. These reprints also included the first-time publication of the third issue (assembled in 1956 but never published by EC).

'''Emilia Lanier''' (also spelled Aemilia (or Amelia) Lanyer) (1569–1645), née Bassano, was a British poet in the early modern English era. She was the first Englishwoman to assert herself as a professional poet through her single volume of poems, ''[[Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum]]'' (1611).  

Born '''Aemilia Bassano''', Lanier was a member of the minor gentry through her father's appointment as a royal musician. She was further educated in the household of [[Susan Bertie, Countess of Kent]]. After her parent's death, Lanier was the mistress of [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]], first cousin of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. In 1592, she became pregnant by Carey and was subsequently married to court musician Alfonso [[Lanier family tree|Lanier]], her cousin. She had two children, but only one survived into adulthood. 

Lanier was often forgotten for centuries, but scholarship about her work has increased dramatically in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chedgzoy|first1=Kate|title=Remembering Aemilia Lanyer|journal=Journal of the Northern Renaissance|date=2010|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|url=http://www.northernrenaissance.org/remembering-aemilia-lanyer/|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is now remembered for her contributions to English literature through her groundbreaking publishing of ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum.'' She is also noted as one of the first feminist writers in England as well as the potential [[Dark Lady (Shakespeare)|"dark lady"]] of Shakespearean myth. Lanier's story has recently been reimagined in a new play by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm titled ''Emilia''; the production was first staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe Theatre]] on 10 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on-2018/emilia&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilia Lanier's life is well documented through her letters, poetry, medical records, legal records, and through sources about the social contexts in which she lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Susanne|title=The Poems of Aemilia Lanyer ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum''|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508361-X|pages=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have used entries in [[astrologer]] [[Simon Forman|Dr. Simon Forman's]] (1552–1611) professional diary, the first casebook kept by an English medical practitioner, which logs interactions with Lanier. Lanier visited Forman many times during 1597 for consultations that incorporated astrological readings, as was usual for the period. As seems to have been the case with many of his patients, Forman attempted to seduce Lanier during their meetings. Lanier refused the astrologer's advances; Forman's documentation of their meetings subsequently became unfairly critical of Lanier. Forman's embittered representation of Lanier's character skewed how the poet has been remembered. 

=== Early life ===
[[File:St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, London.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate]]]]
Church records show that Lanier was baptised '''Aemilia Bassano''' at the parish church of [[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate|St. Botolph]], [[Bishopsgate]], on 27 January 1569. Her father, Baptiste Bassano, was a [[Venice]]-born musician at the court of Elizabeth I. Her mother was Margret Johnson (born ca. 1545–1550), possibly the aunt of court composer [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]]. Lanier had a sister, Angela Bassano, who married Joseph Hollande in 1576. Lanier also had two brothers, Lewes and Phillip, both of whom died before they reached adulthood.&lt;ref name="nzr.mvnu.edu"&gt;McBride, Kari Boyd (2008) [http://nzr.mvnu.edu/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/readings/authors/specific/lanyer.htm Web Page Dedicated to Aemilia Lanyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132300/http://nzr.mvnu.edu/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/readings/authors/specific/lanyer.htm |date=25 September 2015 }}, accessed on 1 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Lanier's family was Jewish or of partial Jewish descent, though this is disputed. Susanne Woods argues that evidence for Lanier's Jewish heritage is, "circumstantial but cumulatively possible".&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Susanne (1999) ''Lanyer: A Renaissance Woman Poet'', p. 180, Oxford: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-512484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds Barroll says Lanier was "probably a Jew", her baptism being, "part of the vexed context of Jewish assimilation in Tudor England."&lt;ref&gt;Barroll, Leeds, "Looking for Patrons" in Marshall Grossman (ed)  (1998) ''Aemilia Lanyer: Gender, Genre, and the Canon'', pp. 29, 44, University Press of Kentucky {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptiste Bassano died on April 11 1576, when Aemilia was seven years old. Bassano's will dictated to his wife that he had left young Aemilia a dowry of £100, to be given to her when she turned twenty-one years old or on the day of her wedding, whichever came first. Forman's records indicate that Bassano's fortune might have been waning before he died which caused considerable unhappiness.&lt;ref name=woods&gt;Susanne Woods, Ed. (1993) ''The Poems of Aemilia Lanyer'', Oxford University Press, New York, NY {{ISBN|978-0-19-508361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xv–xvii}}

Foreman's records also indicate that, after the death of her father, Lanier went to live with [[Susan Bertie, Countess of Kent]]. Some scholars question whether Lanier went to serve Bertie or be fostered by her, but there is no conclusive evidence to confirms either. It was in Bertie's house that Lanier was given a humanist education and learned [[Latin]]. Bertie greatly valued and emphasized the importance of young girls receiving the same level of education as young men.&lt;ref name="nzr.mvnu.edu"/&gt; This decision likely impacted Lanier and her own decision to publish her writing. After living with Bertie, Lanier went to live with [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]], and Margaret's daughter, [[Lady Anne Clifford]]. Dedications in Lanier's own poetry seem to confirm this information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McBride, ''Biography of Aemilia Lanyer'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanier's mother died when Lanier was eighteen. Church records show that Johnson was buried in Bishopsgate on July 7 1587.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Adulthood ===

Not long after her mother's death, Lanier became the [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of Tudor courtier and cousin of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]]. At the time of their affair, Lord Hunsdon was Elizabeth's [[Lord Chamberlain]] and a patron of the arts and theatre. Carey was forty-five years older than Lanier, and records indicate that Carey gave her a pension of £40 a year. Records indicate that Lanier appeared to have enjoyed her time as Carey's mistress. An entry from Forman's diary reads, "[Lanier] hath bin married 4 years/ The old Lord Chamberlain kept her longue She was maintained in great pomp&amp;nbsp;... she hath 40£ a yere &amp; was welthy to him that married her in monie &amp; Jewells".&lt;ref name=woods/&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

In 1592, when she was twenty-three, Lanier became pregnant with Carey's child. Carey paid her off with a sum of money. Lanier was then married to her [[first cousin once removed]], Alfonso Lanier. He was a Queen's musician, and church records show the two were married in [[St Botolph's Aldgate|St. Botolph's church, Aldgate]], on October 18 1592.&lt;ref name="nzr.mvnu.edu"/&gt;

Forman's diary entries implies that Lanier's marriage was an unhappy one. The entry also relates that Lanier was much happier as Carey's mistress than Alfonso's bride. It reads, "...&amp;nbsp;and a nobleman that is ded hath Loved her well &amp; kept her and did maintain her longe but her husband hath delte hardly with her and spent and consumed her goods and she is nowe&amp;nbsp;... in debt".&lt;ref name=woods/&gt;{{rp|xviii}} Another of Forman's diary entries states that Lanier told him about having several miscarriages. Lanier did gave birth to a son, Henry, in 1593 (presumably named after his father, Henry Carey) and a daughter, Odillya, in 1598. Odillya died when she was ten months old and was buried at St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate.

In 1611, Lanier published her volume of poetry, ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum''. Lanier was forty-two years old at the time, and she was the first woman in England to declare herself a poet. People who read her poetry considered it very radical, and many scholars today refer to its style and arguments as "proto-feminist".&lt;ref name="nzr.mvnu.edu"/&gt;

=== Elder years ===

Alfonso and Aemilia remained married until his death in 1613. After Alfonso's death, Lanier supported herself by running a school. She rented a house from Edward Smith to house her students but, due to disputes over the correct rent price, was arrested on two different occasions between 1617 and 1619. Because parents weren't willing to send their children to a woman with a history of arrest, Lanier's dreams of running a prosperous school ended.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;McBride, ''Biography of Aemilia Lanyer'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanier's son eventually married Joyce Mansfield in 1623; they had two children, Mary (1627) and Henry (1630). Henry senior died in October 1633. Later court documents imply that Lanier may have been providing for her two grandchildren after their father's death.&lt;ref name="nzr.mvnu.edu"/&gt;

Little else is known about Lanier's life between 1619 and 1635. Court documents state that Lanier brought a lawsuit against her husband's brother, Clement, for money owed to her from the profits of one of her late husband's financial patents. The court ruled in Lanier's favor, declaring that Clement pay her £20. Clement couldn't pay her immediately, so Lanier brought the suit to court again in 1636 and in 1638. There are no records that verify whether Lanier was ever paid in full but, at the time of her death, she was described as a "pensioner," someone who has a steady income or pension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Lanier died at the age of seventy-six and was buried at Clerkenwell, on April 3 1645.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:1611 Salve Deux Rex Judaeorum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The title page of Lanier's collection of poetry, ''Salve Deux Rex Judaeorum''.]]
At the age of forty-two, in 1611, Lanier published a collection of poetry called ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' (Hail, God, King of the Jews). At the time of publication, it was extremely unusual for an Englishwoman to publish, especially as an attempt to make a living. Emilia was only the fourth British woman to publish poetry. Previously, the English poet [[Isabella Whitney]] had published a 38-page pamphlet of poetry partly written by her correspondents, [[Anne Dowriche]], who was Cornish, and [[Elizabeth Melville]], who was Scottish. Therefore, Lanier's book is the first book of substantial, original poetry written by an Englishwoman, and she wrote it hoping to attract a patron. It was also potentially the first feminist work published in England because all of the dedications are for women, and the "Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum" (a poem about the crucifixion of Christ) is written from a woman's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"Æmilia Lanyer" PoetryFoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Influences ===

Source analysis shows that Lanier draws on the books that she mentions reading, including [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]], [[Chaucer]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]], as well as books by feminists like [[Veronica Franco]]&lt;ref&gt;Dana Eatman Lawrence, ''Class, Authority, and The Querelle Des Femmes: A Women's Community of Resistance in Early Modern Europe''. Ph.D. thesis (Texas: Texas A&amp;M University, 2009) 195&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christine de Pizan]].&lt;ref&gt; In a Cristina Malcolmson paper, 'Early Modern Women Writers and the Gender Debate: Did Aemilia Lanyer Read Christine de Pisan?', she presented at the Centre for English Studies, University of London, n.d..&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier makes use of two unpublished manuscripts and a published a play translation by [[Mary Sidney]], Countess of Pembroke. She also shows a knowledge of theatrical plays by [[John Lyly]], [[Samuel Daniel]], the unpublished manuscript of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Whitney (2006) ''Early Responses to Renaissance Drama'', p. 205, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|978-0-521-85843-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the allegorical meanings of the Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' which were only rediscovered in 2014.&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt;{{rp|192}} The work of [[Samuel Daniel]] informs her Masque, a theatrical form which has been identified in her letter to [[Mary Sidney]] and which resembles the Masque in ''[[The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Faith, "The Epic Structure and Subversive Messages of Aemilia Lanyer's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum." M.A. thesis (Blacksburg, Virginia: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poems ===
The title poem, "Salve Deus Rex Judæorum," is prefaced by ten shorter dedicated poems, all for aristocratic women, beginning with the queen. There is also a prose preface addressed to the reader, comprising a vindication of "virtuous women" against detractors of the sex. The title poem, a long narrative work of over 200 stanzas, tells the story of Christ's passion satirically and almost entirely from the point of view of the women who surround him. The title comes from the words of mockery supposedly addressed to [[Jesus]] on the cross. The satirical nature of the poem was first identified by Boyd Berry.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Berry, '"Pardon though I have digrest": Digression as a style in Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum', in M. Grossman (ed.), Aemilia Lanyer; Gender, Genre and the Canon (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the topics of virtue and religion were considered suitable themes for women writers, Lanier's title poem has been viewed by some modern scholars as a parody of the crucifixion. This argument is made because Lanier uses imagery of the Elizabethan grotesque,&lt;ref&gt;Nel Rhodes, Elizabethan Grotesque (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; found, for instance, in some of the Shakespearean plays, to mock the crucifixion. The views expressed in the poem have been interpreted as "independent of church tradition" and utterly heretical,&lt;ref&gt;Achsah Guibbory, "The Gospel According to Aemilia: Women and the Sacred", in Marshall Grossman (ed.) (1998) ''Aemelia Lanyer: Gender, Genre and the Canon'' (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press)&lt;/ref&gt; though other scholars like A.L. Rowse view Lanier's conversion as genuine and her passionate devotion to Christ and to his mother as sincere. Still, comparisons have been made between Lanier's poem and religious satires that scholars have studied in Shakespearean works, including the poem ''The Phoenix and the Turtle''&lt;ref&gt;James P. Bednarz (2012) ''Shakespeare and the Truth of Love; The Mystery of "The Phoenix and the Turtle"'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan {{ISBN|978-0-230-31940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many of the plays.

In the central section of ''Salve Deus'' Lanier takes up the Querrelle des Femmes&lt;ref&gt;[[The woman question]]&lt;/ref&gt; by redefining the Christian doctrine of 'The Fall', and attacking Original Sin, which is the foundation of Christian theology and Pauline doctrine about women causing human sin. Lanier defends Eve, and womankind in general, arguing that Eve is wrongly blamed for the Original Sin, and no blame is ever placed on Adam. She argues in the poem that Adam shares the guilt because Adam is depicted as being stronger than Eve in the Bible. Therefore, he should have been able to resist the temptation. She also defends women by highlighting the dedication of the female followers of Christ who stayed with him throughout the crucifixion and looked for him first after the burial and resurrection. 

[[File:The dream of Pilate's wife by Alphonse François.jpg|thumb|left|"Le Rêve de la femme de Pilate" ("The dream of Pilate's wife"). Engraving by Alphonse François (1814-1888) after Gustave Doré.]]

In ''Salve Deus,'' Lanier also draws attention to [[Pilate's wife]], a minor character in [[the Bible]], who attempted to intervene and prevent the unjust trial and crucifixion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew 27:19 Biblehub.com&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes the male apostles that forsook and even denied Christ during His crucifixion. Lanier repeats the anti-Semitic aspects of the Gospel accounts, including hostile attitudes towards the Jews for not having prevented the crucifixion; these views are the norm for her period.

There is no clear consensus by scholars on the religious motivation of the title poem. Some maintain that it is a genuinely religious poem from a strong, female perspective. Others have suggested that it is a piece of clever satire. Although there is no agreement on intent and motive, most scholars do note the strong feminist sentiments throughout the entire ''Salve Deus Rex Judæorum.''

Lanier's book ends with the "Description of Cookham," commemorating [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]] and her daughter [[Lady Anne Clifford]]. This is the first published [[Country house poems|country house poem]] in English ([[Ben Jonson]]'s more famous "[[Country House Poems|To Penshurst]]" may have been written earlier but was first published in 1616). Lanier's inspiration came from her stay at [[Cookham Dean]], where Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, lived with her daughter [[Lady Anne Clifford]], for whom Lanier was engaged as a tutor and companion. The Clifford household was notable for its library, some of which can be identified in the painting ''The Great Picture'', attributed to [[Jan van Belcamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-great-picture/ugHL4_ozVj1f3g?hl=en ''The Great Picture''] (1646)&lt;/ref&gt;  As scholar Helen Wilcox asserts, the poem is an allegory of the expulsion from Eden.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Wilcox (2014) ''1611: Authority, Gender, and the Word in Early Modern England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56 (Chichester: Wiley)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist themes ===

''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' has been viewed by many critics to be one of the earliest feminist works of British literature. [[Barbara Kiefer Lewalski]] in her article, "Writing Women and Reading the Renaissance," actually calls Lanier the "defender of womankind"&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski, Barbara Keifer. "Writing Women and Reading the Renaissance."  ''[[Renaissance Quarterly]]'', Vol. 44, No. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 792–821.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewalski claims that with the first few poems of the collection, as dedications to prominent women, Lanier is initiating her ideas of the genealogy of women.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski 802–803&lt;/ref&gt;  The genealogy follows the idea that, "virtue and learning descend from mothers to daughters".&lt;ref name="Lewalski 803"&gt;Lewalski 803&lt;/ref&gt;  

Marie H. Loughlin continues Lewalski's argument writing, "'Fast ti'd unto Them in a Golden Chaine': Typology, Apocalypse, and Woman's Genealogy in Aemilia Lanier's ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum''," by noting that the genealogy of women began with Eve. Loughlin claims that Lanier is advocating the importance of knowledge of both the spiritual and material worlds in connection with women.&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin, Marie H. (Spring, 2000) {{"'}}Fast ti'd unto Them in a Golden Chaine': Typology, Apocalypse, and Woman's Genealogy in Aemilia Lanyer's ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum''", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', Vol. 53, No. 1, pp. 133–179&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier seems to argue that women must focus on the material world and their importance in it to supplement their life in the spiritual world rather than focusing solely on the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin 139&lt;/ref&gt; This argument stems from, what seems to be, Lanier's desire to raise women up to the same level as men.

==Dark Lady theory==

[[File:Zucchero.jpg|thumb|left|So-called Zucchero or Zuccari portrait of Shakespeare, as reproduced c 1800. Attributed to [[Federico Zuccari]]]]

===The Sonnets===
Some have speculated that Lanier, noted as a striking woman, was Shakespeare's "[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]". This identification was first proposed by [[A. L. Rowse]] and has been repeated by several authors since. The Dark Lady speculation is written about notably by David Lasocki and Roger Prior in their 1995 book ''The Bassanos: Venetian Musicians and Instrument makers in England 1531–1665'' and by Stephanie Hopkins Hughes. Although the color of Lanier's hair is not known, records exist in which her Bassano cousins were referred to as "black," a common term at that time for brunettes or persons with Mediterranean coloring. Since she came from a family of Court musicians, she fits Shakespeare's picture of a woman playing the [[virginal]] in [[Sonnet 128]]. Shakespeare claims that the woman was "forsworn" to another in [[Sonnet 152]] which has been speculated to refer to Lanier's relationship with Shakespeare's patron, Lord Hunsdon. The theory that Lanier was the Dark Lady is doubted by other Lanier scholars like Susanne Woods (1999). [[Barbara Lewalski]] notes that Rowse's theory that Lanier was Shakespeare's "Dark Lady" has deflected attention from Lanier as a poet. However, Martin Green has argued that, although Rowse's argument was unfounded, he was correct that Lanier is referred to in the Sonnets.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Green 'Emilia Lanier IS the Dark Lady of the Sonnets' ''English Studies'', 87,5 (2006) 544-576.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hudson (Shakespeare scholar)|John Hudson]] has argued that Lanier is the author of some or all of the works of Shakespeare, and her references to the "Dark Lady" should be interpreted as self-referential or autobiographical.&lt;ref name="JH-DarkLady"&gt;John Hudson, ''Shakespeare's Dark Lady: Amelia Bassano Lanier: The Woman Behind Shakespeare's Plays?'' (Stroud: Amberley Publishing, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the scholarly research, playwrights, musicians and poets have also expressed views. The theater historian and playwright Professor Andrew B. Harris has written a play ''The Lady Revealed'' which chronicles Rowse's identification of Lanier as the 'Dark Lady'. After readings in London and at the Players' Club, it received a staged reading at New Dramatists in New York City on 16 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theladyrevealed.com/home.html "The Lady Revealed; A Play Based on the Life and Writings of A.L. Rowse by Dr. Andrew B. Harris"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005&lt;ref&gt;Duke University, International William Byrd Conference 17–19 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the English conductor [[Peter Bassano]], a descendant of Emilia, suggested that she provided some of the texts for [[William Byrd]]'s 1589 ''Songs of Sundrie Natures'' dedicated to Lord Hunsdon. He further suggested that one of the songs, the setting of the translation of an Italian sonnet: ''Of Gold all Burnisht'' may have been used by Shakespeare as the model for his parodic [[Sonnet 130]]: ''My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun''. Irish poet Niall McDevitt believes Lanier was the Dark Lady, saying "She spurned his advances somewhere along the line and he never won her back&amp;nbsp;... It's a genuine story of unrequited love."&lt;ref&gt;"Conjure the Bard: On London's streets, Nigel Richardson follows a latter-day Prospero bringing William Shakespeare back to life" (February 26, 2011) ''Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Haygarth has argued that a particular miniature portrait by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], 1593, depicts Lanier.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Tait (7 December 2003) "Unmasked- the identity of Shakespeare's Dark Lady", ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===

John Hudson points out that the names Emilia in ''[[Othello]]'' and Bassanio in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' each coincide with a mention of a swan dying to music, which he claims is a standard Ovidian image of a great poet.&lt;ref&gt;John Hudson (10 February 2014) [http://howlround.com/a-new-approach-to-othello-shakespeares-dark-lady "A New Approach to Othello; Shakespeare's Dark Lady"], HowlRound&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson asserts that the "swan song" might be a literary device, used in some classical writings, to conceal the name of the author of a literary work. However, the notion that a dying swan sings a melodious "swan song" was proverbial, and its application to a character need not prove the character is being presented as a poet. Therefore, the evidence remains inconclusive and perhaps coincidental.

Furthermore, Prior argues that the play ''Othello'' refers to a location in the town of Bassano, and that the title of the play might refer to the Jesuit Girolamo Otello from the town of Bassano.&lt;ref&gt;E. A, J. Honigmann  (ed) Othello, Arden Shakespeare 3rd edition (London: 1999) 334&lt;/ref&gt; The character Emilia speaks some of the first feminist lines on an English stage and could thus be seen as a contemporary allegory for Emilia Lanier herself, while the musicians in both plays, Prior argues, are allegories for members of her family. For these and other reasons it has been argued by Prior and other scholars that Lanier co-authored these plays, especially the 1623 [[First Folio]] version of ''Othello'' which contains 163 key lines not present in the 1622 Quarto. 

In addition, Hudson believes that another "signature" exists in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' where there are an Aemilius and a Bassianus, each holding a crown. Each of these mirrors the other's position at the beginning and end of the play as rhetorical markers indicating that the two names are a pair, and book-end the bulk of the play.&lt;ref name=hudson&gt;John Hudson (2014) ''Shakespeare's Dark Lady: Amelia Bassano Lanier: The Woman Behind Shakespeare's Plays?'', Stroud: Amberley Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4456-2160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|163, 230}} For reasons such as these, it is speculated that Emilia Bassano Lanier is one of twelve leading candidates for authorship of the plays and poems attributed to William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shakespeareanauthorshiptrust.org.uk/pages/candidates/other.htm|title=Candidates|last=Shakespeare Authorship Trust|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholarly sources refute this claim.

'''Epode''',&lt;ref&gt;From {{lang-el|ἐπῳδός}}, ''epodos'', "singing to/over, an enchanter."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[poetry|verse]], is the third part of an [[ode]], which followed the [[strophe]] and the [[antistrophe]], and completed the movement.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Epode |volume=9 |page=707 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the ''[[coryphaeus]]'' to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of [[Stesichorus]] and the evolution of [[choral poetry|choral lyric]], a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in [[Greece]], and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]], was really the inventor of this form.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In [[Latin]] poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious [[archaism]], both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of [[Catullus]], founded on an imitation of [[Pindar]], present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of [[Horace]], beginning ''Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri'', possesses this triple character.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==''Epodes'' of Horace==

The word is now mainly familiar from an experiment of [[Horace]] in the second class, for he entitled his fifth book of odes ''Epodon liber'' or the ''Book of Epodes''. He says in the course of these poems, that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in [[Latin literature]], and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, we find the first ten of these epodes composed in alternate verses of [[iambic trimeter]] and [[iambic dimeter]], as at, for example, ''Epode'' 5.1–2:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{| style="border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;"
! scope="col" width="400px" |

At o Deorum quicquid in coelo regit&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Terras et humanum genus&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
|
But, o any of the gods in the heavens ruling&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the lands and the human race.
|}

In the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet, and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified, no doubt, in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. The curious thing is that these particular poems of Horace, which are really short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early [[Greek literature]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''''Fake or Fortune?''''' is a [[BBC One]] television series which examines the [[provenance]] and attribution of notable [[art]]works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-west-england-awards-2016|title=RTS West of England Awards 2016 {{!}} Royal Television Society|website=rts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first series aired in 2011, ''Fake or Fortune?'' has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz |title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=4 December 2016 |work=The Times |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest for an arts show in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/fake-or-fortune|title=Fake or Fortune|website=www.bbcstudios.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Title            = Lautrec
| DirectedBy    = Rachel Jardine
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| DirectedBy    = Lucy Swigler
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|26|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| Title             = A Double Whodunnit
| DirectedBy        = Francis Welch
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|02|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

| Title            = Alberto Giacometti

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|09|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = Answering the programme's call for works of art other than paintings, Philip and Fiona investigate what appears to be a [[plaster cast|plaster]] sculpture of [[Alberto Giacometti]]'s early work ''Tete qui regarde'' or ''[[Gazing Head]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-set-to-appear-in-the-new-series-of-the-fake-or-fortune-television-show-1-4970438|title=Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts set to appear in the new series of the Fake or Fortune? television show|first=Emma|last=Knights|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti"&gt;https://twitter.com/philipmould/status/1038857131821281281&lt;/ref&gt; The object shows signs of extensive damage, and a [[CT scan]] reveals it has been stapled, stitched and glued back together several times. Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

==Reception==
{{update|section|reason=reviews and coverage of later series|date=August 2017}}
Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery. But I couldn't entirely shift the suspicion that some of it was just a little too good to be true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|title=The Weekend's TV: ''Fake or Fortune?''

Reviewing an episode of the seventh season, Michael Hogan of The Telegraph wrote "Arts programming is an increasingly endangered beast on prime time television. This absorbing and enjoyable series flies the flag in quietly thrilling fashion."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2018/08/26/fake-fortune-episode-3-review-story-ended-infist-clenching-delight/ {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freaknik: The Musical''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[television special]] produced by [[T-Pain]]. It features the voice of T-Pain as the Ghost of Freaknik, as well as the voices of entertainers such as [[Lil Wayne]], [[Young Cash]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sophia Fresh]], and [[Rick Ross]], and [[comedian]]s such as [[Andy Samberg]] and [[Charlie Murphy]] who provide additional voices. It was scheduled to air on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] sometime in 2009, but after several push-backs, it premiered on March 7, 2010. The musical is based on the actual music festival [[Freaknik|of the same name]] that used to take place in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A [[#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Jive Records|Jive]] and [[Nappy Boy Entertainment|Nappy Boy]] on April 20, 2010. The 50-minute uncut version of ''Freaknik: The Musical'' has been released on [[DVD]] and other forms of home media.

== Plot ==
The movie starts at a party that a group of young adults ([[Christopher "Kid" Reid]] and [[Affion Crockett]]) claims is the best [[House Party (film)|party]] they have ever attended. An elderly man ([[Lil Jon]]) joins the party and explains the history of [[Freaknik]]. He tells them that Freaknik threw the biggest party of all time, until it was broken up by the police in 1998; he claims the police "killed" Freaknik. Kid n' Play tried to convince that Freaknik is an urban legend like [[Candyman (film)|Candyman]], but as Play looks in the mirror, they were eaten by a swarm of wasps. The group is then led by the old man in [[summoning]] Freaknik, who appears as the Ghost of Freaknik Past ([[T-Pain]]).

The scene changes to a radio announcer named Mr. Thanksgiving ([[DJ Drama]]), who is interviewing Freaknik. Mr. Thanksgiving and Freaknik explain that a rapping contest will be held, the victory of which will get "a lifetime supply of [[money]], [[clothes]], and [[Prostitution|hoes]]". The scene changes once more to the bedroom of Virgil ([[Young Cash]]), Big Uzi ([[Rick Ross]]), and Light Skin ([[CeeLo Green]]), collectively known as the Sweet Tea Mobsters, a group of young adult rappers from Sweet Tea, Florida, who hope to achieve fame. The group decides to drive to Atlanta to participate in the aforementioned contest, along with their [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]]-smoking (and supplying) friend Doela Man ([[DJ Pooh]]).

During their journey, Light Skin tells of a secret society of African Americans called the [[Sigma Pi Phi|Boule]], fraternity parlance for "a council of noblemen", that seeks to guide the course of black culture. The members of this organization are parodies of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Al Sharpton]] ([[Charlie Murphy]]), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Kel Mitchell]]), [[Russell Simmons]] ([[Affion Crockett]]), [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Jesse Jackson]].  They wear medallions inscribed "10%", an allusion to the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] essay [[The Talented Tenth]], which says that a class of exceptional members of the black race will rise to lead it.

The Sweet Tea Mobsters make a number of pit stops, including a detour at a college fraternity party where they meet two alcoholic fraternity members ([[Bill Hader]] and [[Andy Samberg]]). While Virgil is fueling the gas tank, A car, inhabited by four sexy-looking women ([[Sophia Fresh]]) named Leacosia ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), Toprameneesha ([[Sophia Fresh|Skye]]), Obamaniqua ([[Sophia Fresh|Cole Rose]]), and Suzie ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), arrives. He tried to refuse, but the girls beg in song, besides Leacosia giving Virgil a kiss in the form of a gun. He accepts.

Meanwhile, Freaknik meets Rev. Sharpton, who tried to force him to work for the Boule. The plan fails as Freaknik says that he will "never, ever turn his back on his own people", so he escorts Sharpton out via trapdoor.

At the party, the group meets the Fruit Bowl Boys ([[Kel Mitchell]], [[Affion Crockett]], and [[Denzel Whitaker]]), who later become the group’s biggest competition and are from the mostly white suburbs of Sweet Tea, Florida (although they resemble the Sweet Tea Mobsters). On their long, winding road trip, the Sweet Tea Mob gets lost in New Orleans and are confronted by a gangster ([[Snoop Dogg]]) who makes them visit his boss, Trap Jesus ([[Lil Wayne]]). Upon meeting Trap Jesus, the group loses hope, thinking it is the end, but instead he inspires them to compete and gives them one of his many [[Lamborghini]]s to use to get to Atlanta. However, they crash the Lamborghini when Big Uzi becomes enraged after hearing the Fruit Bowl Boys talking about his jail experience. The group gives up except Virgil, who believes that winning the contest is their destiny. The rest of the group still doesn't believe him until they are given a ride in an airplane by the "Flying [[Malcolm X|Malcolms]]."

Meanwhile, the Freaknik character is elected the "ghost mayor of Atlanta" and dubs the city "Freaknation." Soon after, President [[Barack Obama]] hands the presidency over to the ghost of Freaknik, a move that greatly angers Oprah, which wants to see Freaknik destroyed. She devises a plan to send a giant robotic monster called the "Perminator" (a robotic version of Al Sharpton, rebuilt from Sharpton's corpse after he got hit by lightning while blowing out his hair) to Atlanta to destroy Freaknik. Meanwhile, at the party, the Fruit Bowl Boys begin singing "Shank Ya in the Shower." The Sweet Tea Mobsters arrive at Atlanta at the same time as the Perminator begins its attack; it kills the Fruit Bowl Boys almost immediately. He seems to have Freaknik down for the count, but mass love from the crowd empowers Freaknik as the Mob performs, giving him the ability to grow to a monstrous size. Using the love of his fans, Freaknik is able to destroy the Perminator.

After the fight, Freaknik declares the Sweet Tea Mobsters the winners of the contest, but Virgil refuses the prize and tears the check in half. He tells Freaknik that he doesn't need it as long as Freaknik comes back every year, but before he can finish speaking, a golden lion statue-shaped ship comes right in, inhabited by the members of the Boule. But as Freaknik is about to disqualify them, a dog-shaped spacecraft called the "[[Mothership Connection]]" arrives, killing the Boule and their ship (Note: This scene can only be seen on the uncut version of the special). It is inhabited by three brightly colored aliens who are actually [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and Gene "King Poo Poo Man" Anderson. They say they have come to take Freaknik because "there are other galaxies that need his powers of positivity", saying that maybe someday he will return and they can "funk it up" once again. Freaknik gives Virgil his gold chain and says that Atlanta will always be his home. Suzie approaches Freaknik, telling him her baby (which looks like Freaknik) needs a father. Freaknik then rushes on board the ship with Clinton, Collins, and Anderson. Mr. Thanksgiving, the radio DJ from the beginning of the show, then speaks, saying how crazy that was and they'll see us next time; Freaknik is seen dancing on the Mothership as it leaves Earth. And after the end credits, we see Sweet Tea taping the check back together.

==Production==
''Freaknik: The Musical'' originally evolved from a failed [[Television pilot|pilot]] entitled ''That Crook'd 'Sipp'' which was created by Mike Weiss, Jacob Escobedo, and [[Nick Weidenfeld]]. The pilot premiered on television on May 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Banner Debuts New Cartoon|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2007/05/david-banner-debuts-new-cartoon/|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mariel Concepcion|title=David Banner Premieres 'Crook'd' Cartoon|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1323683/david-banner-premieres-crookd-cartoon|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the pilot was to receive six additional episodes scheduled to air sometime after 2007, but the episodes never surfaced and the show's status remained up in the air until mid-2009 when the series was scrapped for good in order to create this special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chris J.

'''Glasmuseet Ebeltoft''' is a museum in [[Ebeltoft]], [[Denmark]]. It is dedicated to the exhibition and collection of contemporary glass art worldwide. 

==Establishment==
The museum was founded in 1985 by Danish glass artists Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch. It is administered by the private Foundation for the Collection of Contemporary International Studio Glass. The museum makes its home in Ebeltofts's former Customs and Excise House; in 2006 a modern wing was added to the original building. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum has a library, gift shop and cafe that are open to the public. Also in 2006 an enclosed garden and glass-blowing studio were added to the complex. The glass studio presents glass working demonstrations to the public and seminars for students of glass.

==Exhibitions==
The museum presents four to six exhibitions per year that focus on contemporary glass art. It shows experimental work by young artists in group and solo shows, as well as new work by well-established artists. Organized by museum staff, the exhibitions often include catalogs that are printed in several languages for the benefit of an international audience. Glasmuseet Ebeltoft often loans the exhibitions it creates to museums in other countries. In the past these countries have included China, England, Finland, Germany and the United States.

==Collections==
Glasmuseet Ebeltoft’s collection contains 1500 objects by 600 artists.  Its holdings are composed of donations and loans of art works, obtained in most cases directly from the artists whose work is desired by the museum. The museum’s collection is most unusual in that artists who have been invited to be represented in it are permitted to exchange or supplement their works in the collection with new pieces.

Artists represented by work in the collection include Klaus Moje and Nick Mount of Australia; Louis Leloup of Belgium; Václav Ciglar, [[František Janák]], Jiří Harcuba, Pavel Hlava, [[Stanislav Libenský/Jaroslava Brychtová|Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová]] and René Roubíček of the Czech Republic; Eva Engström, Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch of Denmark; [[Ivo Lill]] of Estonia; [[Erwin Eisch]], Ursula Merker, Gerhard Ribka, Kurt Wallstab and Ann Wolff of Germany; Ursula Huber-Peer, Pino Signoretto, [[Bruno Pedrosa]] and [[Lino Tagliapietra]] of Italy; Durk Valkema and [[Sybren Valkema]] of the Netherlands; Anna Carlgren, Gunnar Cyrén, Eva Englund, Göran Wärff and Ulrica Hydman-Vallien of Sweden, [[Charles Bray (glass artist)|Charles Bray]] and [[David Reekie]] of the United Kingdom; and Rick Beck, Gary Beecham, William Bernstein, Katharine Bernstein, [[Nicole Chesney]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Fritz Dreisbach]], [[Shane Fero]], [[Robert C. Fritz|Robert Fritz]], [[Michael Glancy]], Richard Jolley, Jon Kuhn, [[Marvin Lipofsky]], [[Harvey Littleton]], [[John Littleton/Kate Vogel]], [[Dante Marioni]], [[Richard Marquis]], Joel Philip Myers, Mary Shaffer, [[Paul Joseph Stankard|Paul Stankard]], [[Michael Taylor (Glass artist)|Michael Taylor]] and Toots Zynsky of the United States.

==Sponsors==
Because it receives no direct financial support from the Danish government, Glassmuseet Ebeltoft relies on sponsorships from Denmark's business community. The museum's three major sponsors are the textile company [[Kvadrat (company)|Kvadrat]], [[Djursland]] Bank and [[NRG Energy|NRGi]] energy company. Other corporate supporters include Primagaz, Montana Møbler, Blue Water Shipping, Cerama and Mois Linien.

Volunteer help is drawn from the museum's "Friends Society", which has about 900 members.

In the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], '''grips''' are technicians in the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a [[key grip]]. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a [[camera dolly|dolly]], [[crane operators|crane]], or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating [[camera dolly|camera doll]]ies or [[crane operators|camera crane]]s. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a [[shot (film)|shot]] under the direction of the [[director of photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howtofilmschool.com/working-as-a-key-grip/|title=Working as a Key Grip: How to be a Key Grip|author=|date=22 November 2012|website=howtofilmschool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Grips' responsibility is to build and maintain all the equipment that supports cameras. This equipment, which includes tripods, dollies, tracks, jibs, cranes, and static rigs, is constructed of delicate yet heavy duty parts requiring a high level of experience to operate and move. Every scene in a feature film is shot using one or more cameras, each mounted on highly complex, extremely expensive, heavy duty equipment. Grips assemble this equipment according to meticulous specifications and push, pull, mount or hang it from a variety of settings. The equipment can be as basic as a tripod standing on a studio floor, to hazardous operations such as mounting a camera on a 100 ft crane, or hanging it from a helicopter swooping above a mountain range.|Media Match Inc.&lt;ref name="mmatch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grip – What do Grips do?|url=http://www.media-match.com/usa/jobtypes/grip-jobs-402724.php|publisher=Media Match Inc|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Good Grips perform a crucial role in ensuring that the artifice of film is maintained, and that camera moves are as seamless as possible. Grips are usually requested by the [[Director of photography|DoP]] (Director of Photography) or the camera operator. Although the work is physically demanding and the hours are long, the work can be very rewarding. Many Grips work on both commercials and features.|Media Match Inc.&lt;ref name="mmatch"/&gt;}}

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]] and most parts of [[Europe]], grips are not involved in lighting.  In the "British System", adopted throughout Europe and the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (excluding Canada), a grip is solely responsible for camera mounting and support.

The term "grip" is from the early era of the [[Circus (performing art)|circus]]. From there it was used in [[vaudeville]] and then in today's film [[sound stage]]s and sets. Some have suggested the name comes from the 1930s–40s slang term for a tool bag or "grip" that these technicians use to carry their tools. Another theory is that in the days of hand-cranked cameras, it was necessary for a few burly men to hang onto the tripod legs to stop excessive movement of the camera. These men became known as the "good grips"—as they were constantly being instructed to "keep a good grip on the tripod".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

US grips typically belong to the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE).  Canadian grips may also belong to IATSE or to Canada's other professional trade unions including Toronto's Nabet 700, or Vancouver's ACFC. British grips usually belong to [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|BECTU]] (Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph &amp; Theatre Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iatse767.org/index.cfm?Section=10&amp;PageNum=78|title=- Las Vegas Craigslist Apartments That Are Affordable For You|author=|date=|website=Las Vegas Craigslist Apartments That Are Affordable For You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HMI on stand sunny.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp |HMI]] head on a stand]]

==Lighting==
On all [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes|union]] jobs, grips do not touch the lights themselves. The placement of lighting instruments and electric power distribution is handled by the [[electrician]]s who work under a [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]]. Grips handle all the non-electrical equipment that modifies the light. This work is done by setting stands that hold flags, nets, diffusing materials or other [[gobo (lighting)|gobos]] that control the quality, intensity, or shape of the light.

Grips also set "passive fill" which is a term for the reflected light that is "bounced" back onto a subject on the [[Fill light|fill]] or non-[[key light]] side.  The first choice for most film-makers' fill is a product known in the US as beadboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.achfoam.com/?p=1430|title=It’s Not Beadboard Anymore -|author=|date=|website=blog.achfoam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp_cAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=beadboard|title=Scenic Design and Lighting Techniques: A Basic Guide for Theatre|first1=Rob|last1=Napoli|first2=Chuck|last2=Gloman|date=11 February 2013|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtools.com/1beadboard.html|title=1" Bead Board 4' x 8' (box of 12) 0 - Filmtools|author=|date=|website=www.filmtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919035920/http://www.depronfoam.co.uk/html/what_is_depron.html|title=what is DEPRON|author=|date=19 September 2017|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5zcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=beadboard|title=Motion Picture and Video Lighting|first=Blain|last=Brown|date=12 November 2012|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called "poly", short for polystyrene, in Europe.  It is rigid insulation made for the construction trade, but was adopted by the film trade because of its "true-white" color and "soft" bounce.

Grips may also be called on to set "negative fill", which is the reduction of ambient or non-directional light, such as ambient  sunlight, to raise contrast on the subject. This is achieved by setting "solids", made of black fabric, either flags (up to 4' × 4') or rags (6' × 6' or larger) on the non-key light side or wherever the negative fill is desired.

When shooting day exteriors, grips perform similar functions, but with the sun as the primary light source. Grips use overhead frames up to 20' × 20' or larger for the shaping or filtering of sunlight. The lighting set-ups for these exterior shots can become quite extensive, and the use of [[Cherry picker|boom lift]]s (called "condors") is common. Condors are especially useful at night when they are rigged to raise lights or diffusing material (up to 120 feet in the air) to create moon-effect lighting.

==Rigging==
Grips also satisfy rigging needs on set. Examples of simple rigs include the ''menace arm'', which allows a light to be boomed over set using one stand, or ''goalposts'' that span over top of set using two stands. More advanced rigs can include working with [[pulley]]s, [[steel cable]] or [[truss]]es. Grips also rig picture cars on [[process trailer]]s, placing camera and lights around the vehicle for [[driving shots]]. This often includes the use of hood mounts, side mounts, suction cup mounts and proprietary clamps to attach film equipment to vehicles without causing damage.

Grips also do "blackouts" and "tenting-out" windows and doors. When shooting interiors day-for-night on location, grips need to eliminate all daylight entering the set.  If windows or other openings are not visible in a shot, the light may be blacked out with a cloth known as [[duvetyne]] or rags, and in rare cases, plastic sheeting.  When windows or doors are seen from camera, black out tents must be created outside of windows to allow lights to be placed outside, or green screens to be seen through the window, lit only by lights placed by electricians.

==Safety==
Grips are also responsible for safety on the set as it relates to the force of [[gravity]]. Insofar as [[C-Stand|stands]], [[ladder]]s, [[scaffold]]s, and overhead rigs are properly installed, grips are charged with making them safe because the other crew members must climb on, walk around, or otherwise negotiate the different grip set-ups.  The key grip may even be held responsible for injuries that happen on set, especially if the injury is caused by a falling lighting instrument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15988">The Indonesian New Art Movement ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru'') was an [[art movement]] of young artists from [[Bandung]] and [[Yogyakarta]] against the institutional concept of Indonesian [[fine art]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Seni Rupa'') being limited to [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s. The movement emerged in 1974, first organised in a protest against the judging of the Second Jakarta Painting Bienalle which awarded prizes to decorative style of paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian Modernism: Diverse Development in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand|last=Tatehata|first=Akira|publisher=The Japan Foundation Asia Centre|year=1995|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters published the Black December Statement (''Desember Hitam'') criticising the lack of social and political consciousness in Indonesian decorative art practices.

The "new art" championed [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which translate to the experimentation of different mediums and mixed media in Indonesian [[contemporary art]]. In 1987, a [[manifesto]] was written by key figures of the New Art Movement titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art."

The New Art Movement ended in 1989 and is considered the beginning of Indonesian [[contemporary art]].

== History ==
In 1974, a group of young artists emerged calling themselves the New Art Movement. The movement was first and foremost an academic rebellion towards fine arts universities in Bandung and Yogyakarta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whiteboardjournal.com/interview/21051/art-history-and-policies-with-jim-supangkat/|title=Art &amp; Curation with Jim Supangkat {{!}} Whiteboardjournal|website=www.whiteboardjournal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the institution's definition of fine art that was limited to decorative art, paintings and sculptures.

The New Art Movement arose spontaneously in both Yogyakarta and Bandung, the two groups having little contact with each other. It was the art critic Sanento Yuliman, a teacher at [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Institut Teknologi Bandung or ITB), who noticed the [[Antimodernist|anti-modernist]] tendency common between the two. He then joined them together under the name New Art Movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement first began in a protest against the judging of the Second Jakarta Painting Biennale of 1974, which awarded prizes to decorative styles of paintings. Protesters consisting of young artists from Bandung and Yogyakarta published the ''Black December Statement'' criticising the lack of social and political consciousness in decorative art, and declaring that it was indicative of the lack of creativity in Indonesian art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Artists of the New Art Movement perceived decorative art as elitist and centralised on Western-derive [[aesthetics]], which they claim were irrelevant to both Indonesia's traditional arts and to the issues of contemporary society. They wanted a more democratic and accessible art, in [[List of art mediums|medium]] and in style.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=‘Artist Roles and Meaning in Modern Indonesian Painting’ in Modernity in Asian Art|last=Wright|first=Astri|publisher=Wild Peony|year=1993|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1977, after the first Exhibition of the New Art Movement in [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]], it was clear that the movement was against any narrow definition of art. They claimed that the existing rigid definition of [[fine art]] hindered the development of [[contemporary art]] and creativity in Indonesia. The movement emphasised the importance of redefining art and its purpose, supporting the basis for its name: "new art"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title='The Two Forms of Indonesian Art' in Modern Indonesian Art: Three Generations of Tradition and Change 1945-1990|last=Supangkat|first=Jim|publisher=Festival of Indonesia|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's exhibitions in 1975-1980 and in 1987-1989 introduced artworks other than [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s, championing [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 2 May 1987, a [[manifesto]] was published by key figures of the New Art Movement titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art."

The New Art Movement ended in 1989 and is considered the beginning of Indonesian contemporary art. Notable figures of the movement include [[Jim Supangkat]], the art historian Sanento Yuliman, [[Dede Eri Supria]], Dadang Christanto and FX Harsono.

== Black December Statement ==

On 31 December 1974, Muryotohartoyo, Juzwar, Harsono, B. Munni Ardhi, M. Sulebar, Ris Purwana, Daryono, Adiyati, D.A. Peransi, Baharuddin Marasutan, Ikranegara, Adri Darmadji, Hardi and Abdul Hadi WM, presented the Black December Statement.

The statement critiques Indonesia's lack of clear cultural strategy in art making, and that the producers of arts and culture are not in the smallest sense aware of the discourse regarding the most basic human problems in Indonesian culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ivaa-online.org/files/uploads/texts/Black%20December%201974%20Statement.pdf|title=Black December 1974 Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=Indonesian Visual Art Archive (IVAA)|archive-url=http://archive.ivaa-online.org/|archive-date=2015|dead-url=|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black December statements are as follow:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. That the diversity of Indonesian painting is a reality that may not be denied, nonetheless this diversity does not in itself show healthy development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. That in order to guarantee a sustainable cultural development painters are beckoned to provide spiritual directions that are based on the values of humanity, and are oriented to the realities of social life and political-economic culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. That creativity is the destiny of painters that go through whatever means possible in order to arrive at new perspectives for Indonesian painting. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4. That therefore the identity of Indonesian painting has an immediate and clear existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5. That what creates dead-end for the development of Indonesian painting to this day is old and over-used concepts, that are still held on to by the establishment, arts and cultural producers and established artists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Note: The Black December Statement is translated from [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] to [[English language|English]] in 2015 after the collaborative efforts of the Indonesian Visual Art Archive (IVAA) and Asia Art Archive.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Manifesto ==

Thirteen years after the Black December Statement was presented, the New Art Movement published a [[manifesto]] titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art." The manifesto was presented in [[Jakarta]] on 2 May 1987.

The manifesto states three key proclamations:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/CollectionOnline/Details/47629|title=Manifesto Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru 1987: Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art|last=|first=|date=|website=Asia Art Archive|archive-url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/|archive-date=2015|dead-url=|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Fine art needs emancipation. Expression of visual art should prioritise the deconstruction of misunderstood traditions of fine art. Rational visual art expression should prioritise statements based on the aesthetics of emancipation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. A redefinition of fine art is required, to free it from the definition rooted in ''artes-liberals – ''seek a new definition which can accommodate every expression of visual art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Emancipation of encultured thought is required to counter isolated points of view that only acknowledge one notion of art, and only one global society within a unified harmonious culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The movement also made an explicit statement in relation to the third proclamation:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In addition to a new definition, development of Indonesian contemporary art also needed basic aesthetic thinking and a study of art history to replace the cultural identity debate and East-West confrontation"''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The manifesto was deemed successful in the way [[Installation art|installation]] and [[conceptual art]] becomes immersive in modern Indonesian art compared to the few previous attempts which had no [[manifesto]] to back them up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Style and Development ==
The "new art" primarily consists of [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings]].

=== Development ===

The New Art Movement was [[Antimodernist|anti-modernist]]. It rejected [[Modern art|modern art's]] purity of expression, the individualism of the artist, and the tendency toward the decorative as the highest form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Supangkat|first=Jim|date=|title=Indonesian Contemporary Art: a Continuation|url=|journal=Potential of Asian Thought|volume=|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the movement developed, the works of New Art artists began to take on the character of [[Installation art|installations]] and collaborative practices.

In an arguably [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] approach, the movement also aims to tear down the barrier between [[High culture|high art]] and [[Low culture|low art]]. The interest of the New Art artists in low art was closely linked to the problems of [[poverty]] in the city and maintenance of traditional culture in rural regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Style and Concept ===
The style and [[concept]] of New Art artists are characteristically different to contemporary Indonesian art in the present day, which consists of [[Post-Suharto era|post-reformasi]] artists known most commonly as ''Generation 2000''. Although the [[Installation art|installation]] and [[Mixed media|mixed-media]] format of this newer generation of artists is heavily influenced by the New Art Movement, their concerns are significantly different.

New Art artists experience politics in a more strident environment before the end of the Suharto regime, which strongly inform their art practice.  In such ways, artists like FX Harsono and Dadang Christanto comment on specific tragedies in Indonesian history most notably the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966]]. Many of the New Art artists emphasised [[social criticism]] in their works.

Contemporary readings and studies of the New Art Movement propose that [[Memory|memories]] are central to the works of these artists. Their works become a site of remembrance, recollections of the past, and reconciliation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kengerian tak terucapkan/The Unspeakable Horror|last=Wiyanto|first=Hendro|publisher=Bentara Budaya Jakarta|year=2002|isbn=|location=Jakarta|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reference the power struggle of the 'common people', the marginalised, and the severe consequences of socio-political tensions that occurred in that time.

== Issues and Debates ==
The New Art Movement was often criticised by the conservative art establishment as a derivative to [[Pop art|Pop Art]], although leading New Art artist FX Harsono claims that the artists were more interested in [[Neo-Dada]] than Pop Art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This conversation with the West, presented in a rather revolutionary manner by New Art artists, returns to the modernist debate about East-West confrontation in art of developing countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the interest of '[[national identity]]', the New Art Movement was criticised to have championed avant-garde mediums and concepts of [[Art of Europe|Western art history]] instead of embracing the nation's traditional values that makes it characteristically "Indonesian." The movement tackled this issue by emphasising the importance of basic [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] thinking and a study of [[art history]] to replace the cultural identity debate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also critical to the progression of the New Art Movement is clarifying the positions of contemporary art and traditional art. Artists and critics responds to this struggle by claiming that "traditional art is not something of the past, but is still alive and evolves like contemporary art."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, New Art artists sought to merge the two art forms in their contemporary art practice.

In the latter part of the 1980s, the New Art Movement concluded that "art is a plural concept,"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; embracing installations as its primary/hybrid format in ending the East-West confrontation debates and claiming the inter-relationship of contemporary and traditional art.

The issues and methods involved in the New Art movement play an important part in the great interest on cultural identity that emerged in Indonesia in the 1980s, and continue to inform the practice of contemporary art in the present day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7646">The '''Jane Drew Prize''' is an architecture award given annually by the ''[[Architects' Journal]]'' to a person showing innovation, diversity and inclusiveness in [[architecture]]. It is named after the [[English people|English]] [[modern architecture|modernist architect]] [[Jane Drew]].

==Background==
The Jane Drew Prize began with discussions in 1997 between the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) Women Architects Group and the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]].&lt;ref name="Indy 1998"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nonie Niesewand |title =Prize farce at the gong show |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |date=4 June 1998 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/prize-farce-at-the-gong-show-1162676.html |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new prize was launched in January 1998 with a ceremony held at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in [[London]]. The award was created to recognise promotion of innovation, diversity and inclusiveness in architecture.

Problems were encountered with the initial award, primarily in finding suitable candidates that met all three criteria. A forum was held on 19 May 1998 where the four shortlisted candidates (client [[Jane Priestman]], artist Martin Richman, landscape architect [[Kathryn Gustafson]] and architectural practice [[Fashion Architecture Taste]]) were asked to give a ten-minute presentation. The evening was described as "tedious" and Gustafson didn't even turn up.&lt;ref name="Indy 1998" /&gt;  The award was finally presented to Gustafson on 4 June after strong disagreements and near-resignations amongst the judging panel.&lt;ref name="Indy 1998" /&gt;

Winners are chosen by the AJ Women in Architecture Judging Panel.&lt;ref name="Huff Zaha latest" /&gt; According to the 2013 entry guidelines, the prize recognises a "contribution to the status of women in architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = THE JANE DREW PRIZE Entry Guidelines |publisher=Architects' Journal |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/Journals/2013/10/30/c/s/t/WIA-entry-JaneDrew.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive Evangelical, Thomas Dale (1797–1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London - John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography &gt;&gt; Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/vanburd1.html An Introduction to Helen Gill Viljoen's Unpublished Biography of Ruskin by Van Akin Burd]; [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/spates1.html Editor's Introductory Comments on Viljoen's Chapter by James L.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II.

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/catalogue-of-the-ryuzo-mikimoto-collection-ruskin-library-tokyo-2004/oclc/56923207 |title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |website=WorldCat.org |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the innovator of the modern [[Olympic Games]], used Ruskin's principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be "Ruskinized" to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. 'The masses are much more sensitive to the perfection of the whole than to any separate details': The Influence of John Ruskin's Political Economy on Pierre de Coubertin, in: Olympika, 1996 Vol. V, pp. 25–44. www.library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501c.pdf;[[Arnd Krüger]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum. The Museum has promoted Ruskin's art teaching methods using the collection, using them as the basis for in-person and online drawing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994/ |title=The Elements of Drawing |access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin in the 21st-century===
Admirers and scholars of Ruskin can visit the [[Ruskin Library]] at [[Lancaster University]], also Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and the [[Ruskin Museum]], both in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] in the English [[Lake District]].

[[File:John Ruskin Street in London.JPG|thumb|right|John Ruskin Street in [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], London]]
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010. Stuart Eagles, '' The Economic Symposium. John Ruskin and the Modern World: Art and Economics, 1860–2010'' in ''The Companion'' no. 10 (2010), pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/659657 ''Omnibus.

BBC1, 13 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury]], Raficq Abdulla, [[Jonathon Porritt]] and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]] were among those to contribute to the symposium, ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]] (ed.) ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R. Shapiro]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA657 |title=The Yale Book of Quotations|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=657 |isbn=9780300107982 |accessdate = 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin's authorship.&lt;ref name=Landow2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Landow |first=George P. |title=A Ruskin Quotation? |publisher=VictorianWeb.org |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/quotation.html |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a posting of the ''Ruskin Library News'', a blog associated with the [[Ruskin Library]] (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at [[Lancaster University]]), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, "This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin."&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskinlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/on-the-present-economic-situation/|title=On the present economic situation:|last=Ruskin Library|publisher=Ruskin Library|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

("There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that man's lawful prey.")

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"/&gt; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s, photo from the [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The effect is named after [[Jack Kirby]], the influential comic book artist who created this stylistic device.&lt;ref name="Mendryk"/&gt; While the Kirby Krackle in its mature form first appeared in Kirby's work during 1965–1966 (in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''),&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt; comics historian Harry Mendryk (of the Jack Kirby Museum &amp; Research Center) has traced the earliest version of the stylistic device as far back as 1940 to Jack Kirby &amp; [[Joe Simon]]'s ''[[Blue Bolt]] #5''. As Joe Simon was the [[inker]] on that comic, he may have been partially responsible for look of the proto-Kirby Krackle. Examples of a transitional form of the Kirby Krackle appear in two of Kirby's stories from the late 1950s: ''The Man Who Collected Planets'' from 1957 (pencils and inks by Kirby) and ''The Negative Man'' from 1959 (inks attributed to Marvin Stein).&lt;ref name="Mendryk"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Philosophy professor and author [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]] wrote:

{{quote|For Kirby, the human body is a manifestation or crystallization of finally inexplicable energies—a superbody. [...] What [[Franz Mesmer|Mesmer]] called [[animal magnetism]], [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] knew as the [[Odic force|blue od]], and [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]] saw as a radiating blue cosmic [[orgone]] becomes in Jack Kirby a trademark energetics signaled by "burst lines" and a unique energy field of black, blobby dots that has come to be affectionately known as the "Kirby Krackle" [...]. The final result was a vision of the human being as a body of frozen energy that, like an atomic bomb, could be released with stunning effects, for good or for evil. These metaphysical energies, I want to suggest constitute the secret [[Source (comics)|Source]] of Kirby's art.&lt;ref name="Kripal"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CS09XNEr38C&amp;pg=PT286&amp;lpg=PT286 | title=Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal | publisher=University of Chicago Press | last=Kripal| first= Jeffrey J. | year=2011 | location=Chicago, IL | pages=286–287 | isbn=9780226453859}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6314">The '''Kunstareal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʊnst.aʁeˌaːl|lang}}, "art district") is a [[museum]] quarter in the city centre of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Area of arts ==
[[Image:Alte Pinakothek.JPG|thumb|290px|[[Alte Pinakothek]]]]
It consists of the three "Pinakotheken" galleries ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Neue Pinakothek]] and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]), the [[Glyptothek]], the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] (both museums are specialized in Greek and Roman art), the [[Lenbachhaus]], the [[Museum Brandhorst]] (a private collection of modern art) and several galleries. Also the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst]] (the state collection of Egypt art) was moved to the Kunstareal in 2013. The history of the museums in this area of Munich began in 1816 with the erection of the Glyptothek at [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] and was completed with the new building for the Egyptian Museum (2012) and the extension of the Lenbachhaus (2013). 

Close to the Pinakothek der Moderne the neo-classical ''Palais Dürckheim'' (constructed in 1842&amp;ndash;44) served at times as a building dedicated to bringing art closer to the visitors, while the adjoining ''[[Türkentor (Munich)|Türkentor]]'' (1826), the gate of a demolished royal caserne, is set to become a display window for temporary contemporary art. As of 2009 a general project plan is under discussion to ensure  the integration of the different museum buildings and to improve the access to the art district from the inner city.

The '''Alte Pinakothek's''' rather monolithic structure contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s Christ-like ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer, Munich)|Self-Portrait]]'', his ''[[The Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] self-portrait ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and his two-storey-high ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The ''[[Madonna of the Carnation]]'' is the only painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in a German gallery. 

The '''Neue Pinakothek''' is especially famous for its comprehensive collection of paintings of [[Impressionism]] from [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and many others.

The '''Pinakothek der Moderne''' unifies the ''Bavarian State Collection of Modern and Contemporary Arts'', the ''National Collection of Works on Paper'' and the ''Museum for Design and Applied Arts'' with the Munich Technical University's ''Museum of Architecture'' in one building and is deemed one of the most important and popular museums of modern art in Europe. It houses indeed the largest collection of industrial design. The Collection of Works on Paper ranges from masterpieces of Albrecht Dürer, [[Rembrandt]], [[Michelangelo]] and Leonardo da Vinci to Paul Cézanne, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[David Hockney]]. 
It is owned by the nearby '''[[Staatliche Graphische Sammlung München]]''', a world-renowned collection of 400,000 prints, engravings and drawings dating back to the Renaissance. The Collection of Modern Art keeps a large collection of paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Max Beckmann]] and of the painters of [[Die Brücke]].

Before [[World War I]], the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blaue Reiter]] group of artists worked in Munich. Many of their works can now be seen at the '''Lenbachhaus'''. 

[[Image:München - Pinakotheken (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|left|Pinakotheken in the Kunstareal]]
The modern '''Museum Brandhorst''' focus on the work of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Cy Twombly]].

An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the '''Glyptothek''' and the '''Staatliche Antikensammlung''' (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such famous pieces as the ''[[Medusa Rondanini]]'', the ''[[Barberini Faun]]'' and the ''figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]]'' on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. The internationally renowned collection of antique pottery is outstanding. The '''Museum für Abgüsse klassischer Bildwerke''' displays the world's most famous ancient Greek and Roman sculptures as plaster casts. 

The Kunstareal was further augmented by the completion of the '''Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst''' (Egyptian Museum). This museum displays exhibits from all periods of Ancient Egypt's history but also reliefs from Assyria and a lion from the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon.

Nearby the Kunstareal are several natural scientific museums of the Bavarian state, like the ''[[Paläontologisches Museum München]]'', the ''[[Geologisches Museum München|Geological Museum]]'' and the ''Museum Reich der Kristalle'' as the public part of the "Mineralogische Staatssammlung Muenchen" (Bavarian State Collection for Mineralogy).

[[File:LettersToMalcolm.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Geoffrey Bles]])]]

'''''Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer''''' is a book by [[C.S. Lewis]] posthumously published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis. ''Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer'', Harvest Books, 1973  {{ISBN|0-15-650880-X}} {{ISBN|0-15-650880-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; The book takes the form of a series of letters to a fictional friend, "Malcolm", in which Lewis meditates on prayer as an intimate dialogue between man and God. Beginning with a discussion of "corporate prayer" and the liturgical service, Lewis goes on to consider practical and metaphysical aspects of private prayer, such as when to pray and where, ready-made prayer, petitionary prayer, prayer as worship, penitential prayer, and prayer for the dead. The concluding letter discusses "liberal" Christians, the soul and resurrection.

''Letters to Malcolm'' is generally thought to be one of Lewis's less successful books and differs from his other books on Christianity in that it poses a number of questions which Lewis does not attempt to answer.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jacobs, ''The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C.S.Lewis'', HarperSanFancisco {{ISBN|978-0-06-087269-4}} {{ISBN|0-06-087269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis moreover shows a reluctance to be as critical of radical theologians such as [[Alec Vidler]] and [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]] as his imaginary friend Malcolm wants him to be.

[[Frank Weston Benson]] made '''Waterscapes''' in oil, watercolor, ink, pencil and created etchings. He also made portraits, landscapes, wildlife, interiors and other works of art.

''Salem Harbor'' was Benson's first [[etching]], made while he was at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline&gt;[[#PEMTimeline|Peabody Essex Museum, Interactive Presentation, Benson Timeline.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and published in the school's magazine "Students in the School of Drawing". Benson was one of the editors of the magazine. Thirty years later, in 1912, Benson began etching again, a practice that thereafter became a major body of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paff17|Benson, Paff (1917)]], 28&lt;/ref&gt; Two plates were made of ''The Anchorage'' that depicted a fisherman bringing a dory to shore. The first resulted in 48 proofs on shogun paper, 43 of which were signed. The second plate was more spacious than the first and resulted in 25 signed proofs printed on shogun paper. The work was exhibited in 1915 and 1916 four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paff19|Benson, Paff (1919)]], 89.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Casting for Salmon'' is one of Benson's 359 etchings, most of which were made of [[waterfowl]]. In the simple composition of a fisherman reflected influence by Japanese artists and demonstrated his skill as an etcher.&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline/&gt;

Benson declared ''Calm Morning'' of his three oldest children his "best out of door work." In this case Benson was deliberate in his approach, he made three oil studies before making the final painting; Generally he started and finished he outdoor paintings on one canvas. From left to right, Eleanor, Elisabeth and George fished over the side of a boat off in the waters of their summer home in [[Maine]]. Benson was masterful in capturing the reflection of the boat on the water and the deeper color of its shadow. The vivid, luminous colors give depict the sun shining upon the children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BMA|''Calm Morning'', Boston Museum of Art.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Benson's career he painted more than 600 [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], like ''Camp'' (or ''Salmon Fishing'') that he made during a salmon fishing trip in [[Canada]] with his son, George.&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline/&gt;

'''''Malle Babbe''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted between 1633 and 1635 and now in the [[Gemäldegalerie]], [[Berlin]]. The painting has also been titled as ''Hille Bobbe'' or the ''Witch of Haarlem''. It was traditionally interpreted as a [[tronie]], or [[genre painting]] in a portrait format, depicting a mythic witch-figure. The painting is now often identified as a genre-style portrait of a specific individual from [[Haarlem]], known as Malle (meaning "crazy") Babbe, who may have been an alcoholic or suffered from a mental illness.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

The painting has been an object of artistic admiration from Hals's lifetime, as there are several copies and variants painted by his followers. It was admired by [[Gustave Courbet]], who made a copy of it in 1869 while it was on view in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=Slive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slive|first=Seymour|title=On the Meaning of Frans Hals' 'Malle Babbe'|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=October 1963|volume=105|issue=727|pages=432, 434–436|jstor=874065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] measures 75 × 64&amp;nbsp;cm and shows the face of a smiling woman, sitting at the corner of a table, apparently talking or laughing at someone or something to the right of the canvas. With her right hand, the woman is gripping a [[pewter]] beer mug with an opened lid. An [[owl]] sits on the woman’s left shoulder. The clothing of the woman is simple and corresponds with the mode around 1630 in Haarlem. Her face is animated in an almost manic grimace. The very free handling of paint is typical of Hals' style, and not very different from that on his more formal commissioned portraits.

==Name==
The painting was for a long time mislabelled as ''Hille Bobbe'' (alternatively ''The Witch of Haarlem'') through a misreading of the inscription on the back of the picture frame which in fact reads ''Malle Babbe van Haerlem … Fr[a]ns Hals'' (Malle Babbe of Haarlem).
[[Image:Frans Hals Malle Babbe Inschrift.jpg|thumb|400px|Inscription to verso: ''Malle Babbe van Haerlem … Fr[a]ns Hals']]
Under the witch interpretation, the owl was considered a possible [[familiar spirit|familiar]]. However the subject matter of Frans Hals in his other paintings would suggest that the painting is probably of a pub scene, in which case the owl would reflect the Dutch proverb, "drunk as an owl."&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite web|title=Malle Babbe, Style of Frans Hals|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001071|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kees Verkade Malle Babbe.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|''Bronze Malle Babbe'', by [[Kees Verkade]] (1978), located on [[Barteljorisstraat]], Haarlem]]

== The real Malle Babbe ==
Research in the [[Netherlands]] municipality of [[Haarlem]] showed that a real Malle Babbe actually existed, named Barbara Claes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; She was included in a list of residents of the local hospital called [[Het Dolhuys]], situated outside the city walls, which served people who were dangerous to themselves or to society, as well as a hospice for travellers arriving after the city gates had closed.  Around 1642, Pieter Hals, a son of Frans Hals, was also in this hospice. Hals and this Malle Babbe had probably already met by this time, as she was evidently a known personality in Haarlem, although none other of her biographical details survive except that she died in 1663. In Dutch the adjective "Malle" signifies "loony" and it is not uncommon to see painters or writers depict this type of village figure. In this type of depiction one can find a record of unbalanced figures of society as belonging to the scenery of everyday life, or the artist may enjoy exploring the thin line between sanity and lunacy.

== Other paintings ==
[[File:Umkreis Frans Hals New Yorker Malle Babbe.jpg|thumb|250px|''Malle Babbe'', Oil on canvas, 74.9 x 61 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] is in possession of a similar painting. It is not clear who the creator of this painting is. In the past it was also attributed to Frans Hals, but it is now thought to be the work of one of his pupils.&lt;ref name=Met/&gt;

Another variant depicts Malle Babbe accompanied by a male drinker. There are two paintings of unknown authorship in which she is depicted with a male figure adapted from a work by [[Adriaen Brouwer]]. Both figures are depicted behind a table full of fish.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour Slive, ''Frans Hals'', 3 volumes, Phaidon Press Ltd., London, 1974, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two portraits apparently depicting Babbe, but without the owl.&lt;ref&gt;Slive 1974 Volume 3 page 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

== Song ==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/hals-malle-babbe.html Hals's Malle Babbe], [[Smarthistory]]&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =Hals's Malle Babbe | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/hals-malle-babbe.html | accessdate =February 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
In the Netherlands, the painting also gave its name to a well-known song, written by [[Boudewijn de Groot]] and [[Lennaert Nijgh]] and first performed in 1973 by [[Rob de Nijs]]. The actual subject of the song "Malle Babbe" however was inspired by another painting by Frans Hals, ''[[The Gypsy Girl]]'', depicting a busty young woman, possibly a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Voskuil: ''Testament. Leven en werk van Lennaert Nijgh'', Kats, 2007, {{ISBN|9789071359057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song celebrates her lusty sexuality. However, it also refers to her having frothy beer in a tavern, the setting for ''Malle Babbe'', not ''The Gypsy Girl''. Both pictures were seen by Nijgh in a 1962 exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16095">The [[art]] of  [[origami]] or paper folding has received a considerable amount of [[mathematics|mathematical]] study. Fields of interest include a given paper model's flat-foldability (whether the model can be flattened without damaging it) and the use of paper folds to solve [[equation|mathematical equations]].

==History==
In 1893, Indian mathematician [[T. Sundara Rao]] published "Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding" which used paper folding to demonstrate proofs of geometrical constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding |author= T. Sundara Rao |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ACV5060.0001.001  |publisher=Addison |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was inspired by the use of origami in the [[kindergarten]] system. This book had an approximate trisection of angles and implied construction of a cube root was impossible. In 1936 [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch|Margharita P. Beloch]] showed that use of the 'Beloch fold', later used in the sixth of the [[Huzita–Hatori axioms]], allowed the general cubic equation to be solved using origami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Huzita ed. (1989), pp. 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; but were overlooked until the first six were rediscovered by [[Humiaki Huzita]] in 1991. The first International Meeting of Origami Science and Technology (now known as the International Conference on Origami in Science, Math, and Education) was held in 1989 in Ferrara, Italy.

===Flat folding===

[[Image:Lang rule one.png|thumb|100px|Two-colorability]]
[[Image:Lang rule three.png|thumb|100px|Angles around a vertex]]

The construction of origami models is sometimes shown as crease patterns. The major question about such crease patterns is whether a given crease pattern can be folded to a flat model, and if so, how to fold them; this is an [[NP complete|NP-complete problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2002 |publisher=AK Peters |isbn=978-1-56881-181-9

|title=The Proceedings of the Third International Meeting of Origami Science, Mathematics, and Education
|author=Thomas C. Hull |chapter=The Combinatorics of Flat Folds: a Survey
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related problems when the creases are orthogonal are called [[map folding]] problems. There are three mathematical rules for producing flat-foldable origami [[crease pattern]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/robert_lang_folds_way_new_origami.html | title=Robert Lang folds way-new origami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Maekawa's theorem]]: at any vertex the number of valley and mountain folds always differ by two.
#: It follows from this that every vertex has an even number of creases, and therefore also the regions between the creases can be colored with two colors.
# [[Kawasaki's theorem]]: at any vertex, the sum of all the odd angles adds up to 180 degrees, as do the even.
# A sheet can never penetrate a fold.

Paper exhibits zero [[Gaussian curvature]] at all points on its surface, and only folds naturally along lines of zero curvature.  Curved surfaces that can't be flattened can be produced using a non-folded crease in the paper, as is easily done with wet paper or a fingernail.

Assigning a crease pattern mountain and valley folds in order to produce a flat model has been proven by [[Marshall Bern]] and [[Barry Hayes]] to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Huzita–Hatori axioms===
{{main article|Huzita–Hatori axioms}}

Some [[Compass and straightedge constructions#Impossible constructions|classical construction problems of geometry]] — namely [[trisecting an arbitrary angle]] or [[doubling the cube]] — are proven to be unsolvable using [[compass and straightedge]], but can be solved using only a few paper folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/omfiles/geoconst.html |title=Origami and Geometric Constructions |author=Tom Hull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper fold strips can be constructed to solve equations up to degree 4. The Huzita–Hatori axioms are an important contribution to this field of study. These describe what can be constructed using a sequence of creases with at most two point or line alignments at once. Complete methods for solving all equations up to degree 4 by applying methods satisfying these axioms are discussed in detail in ''Geometric Origami''.&lt;ref name="GO-Geretsch"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructions==

As a result of origami study through the application of geometric principles, methods such as Haga's theorem have allowed paperfolders to accurately fold the side of a square into thirds, fifths, sevenths, and ninths. Other theorems and methods have allowed paperfolders to get other shapes from a square, such as equilateral [[triangles]], [[pentagons]], [[hexagons]], and special rectangles such as the [[golden rectangle]] and the [[silver rectangle]]. Methods for folding most regular polygons up to and including the regular 19-gon have been developed.&lt;ref name="GO-Geretsch"/&gt; A regular ''n''-gon can be constructed by paper folding if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;(''n'') is 3-[[smooth number|smooth]], where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]].

===Haga's theorems===
[[File:Haga theorem 1.svg|thumb|200px|BQ is always a rational if AP is.]]
The side of a square can be divided at an arbitrary rational fraction in a variety of ways. Haga's theorems say that a particular set of constructions can be used for such divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://origami.gr.jp/Archives/People/CAGE_/divide/02-e.html
|title=How to Divide the Side of Square Paper
|author=Koshiro |publisher=Japan Origami Academic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly few folds are necessary to generate large odd fractions. For instance {{Frac|1|5}} can be generated with three folds; first halve a side, then use Haga's theorem twice to produce first {{Frac|2|3}} and then {{Frac|1|5}}.

The accompanying diagram shows Haga's first theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;BQ = \frac{2 AP}{1 + AP}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function changing the length ''AP'' to ''QC'' is [[Involution (mathematics)|self inverse]]. Let ''x'' be ''AP'' then a number of other lengths are also rational  functions of ''x''. For example:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="text-align:center; width:200px; height:200px" border="1"

===Doubling the cube===
[[Image:Delian origami.svg|thumb|200px|Doubling the cube: PB/PA = cube root of 2]]
The classical problem of [[doubling the cube]] can be solved using origami. This construction is due to Peter Messer:&lt;ref name="lang2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix08/tech/slides/lang.pdf |title=From Flapping Birds to Space Telescopes: The Modern Science of Origami  |last=Lang |first=Robert J |year=2008 |publisher=Usenix Conference, Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A square of paper is first creased into three equal strips as shown in the diagram. Then the bottom edge is positioned so the corner point P is on the top edge and the crease mark on the edge meets the other crease mark Q. The length PB will then be the cube root of 2 times the length of AP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter Messer|title=Problem 1054|journal=[[Crux Mathematicorum]]|volume=12|issue=10|year=1986|pages=284–285.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edge with the crease mark is considered a marked straightedge, something which is not allowed in [[compass and straightedge constructions]].  Using a marked straightedge in this way is called a [[neusis construction]] in geometry.

===Trisecting an angle===
[[File:Origami Trisection of an angle.svg|thumb|200px|Trisecting the angle CAB]]
[[Angle trisection]] is another of the classical problems that cannot be solved using a compass and unmarked ruler but can be solved using origami. This construction is due to Hisashi Abe.&lt;ref name="lang2008" /&gt;  The angle CAB is trisected by making  folds PP' and QQ' parallel to the base with QQ' halfway in between. Then point P is folded over to lie on line AC and at the same time point A is made to lie on line QQ' at A'. The angle A'AB is one third of the original angle CAB. This is because PAQ, A'AQ and A'AR are three [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|congruent]] triangles. Aligning the two points on the two lines is another neusis construction as in the solution to doubling the cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origami 5 |chapter=Hands-on Geometry with Origami |author1= Michael J Winckler |author2=Kathrin D Wold |author3=Hans Georg Bock |page=225 |isbn=978-1-56881-714-9 |year=2011 |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

The problem of [[rigid origami]], treating the folds as hinges joining two flat, rigid surfaces, such as [[sheet metal]], has great practical importance. For example, the [[Miura map fold]] is a rigid fold that has been used to deploy large solar panel arrays for space satellites.

The [[napkin folding problem]] is the problem of whether a square or rectangle of paper can be folded so the perimeter of the flat figure is greater than that of the original square.

Curved origami also poses a (very different) set of mathematical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/attendees/design/22.php Siggraph: "Curved Origami"]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Curved origami allows the paper to form [[developable surface]]s that are not flat.

[[Wet-folding]] origami allows an even greater range of shapes.

The maximum number of times an incompressible material can be folded has been derived. With each fold a certain amount of paper is lost to potential folding.  The [[loss function]] for folding paper in half in a single direction was given to be &lt;math&gt;L=\tfrac{\pi t}{6} (2^n + 4)(2^n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''L'' is the minimum length of the paper (or other material), ''t'' is the material's thickness, and ''n'' is the number of folds possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korpal|first1=Gaurish|title=Folding Paper in Half|journal=At Right Angles|date=25 November 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=20–23|url=http://teachersofindia.org/en/ebook/folding-paper-half}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distances ''L'' and ''t'' must be expressed in the same units, such as inches. This result was derived by [[Britney Gallivan|Gallivan]] in 2001, who also folded a sheet of paper in half 12 times, contrary to the popular belief that paper of any size could be folded at most eight times. She also derived the equation for folding in alternate directions.&lt;ref name="Mathworld"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fold-and-cut problem]] asks what shapes can be obtained by folding a piece of paper flat, and making a single straight complete cut. The solution, known as the fold-and-cut theorem, states that any shape with straight sides can be obtained.

A practical problem is how to fold a map so that it may be manipulated with minimal effort or movements. The [[Miura fold]] is a solution to the problem, and several others have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25678354|title = In search of a practical map fold|last = Hull|first = Thomas|date = 2002|journal = Math Horizons|doi = |pmid = |pages = 22–24|volume = 3|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Society of Composers''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Komponistforening}}) was founded in 1917. The Society’s main objectives are to promote its members' music and secure their rights. 

As of today the Society counts 185 members who meet regularly for discussions and seminars. The Society works towards creating opportunities for the dissemination of contemporary music and for increasing public awareness of this art form. Contemporary music is promoted via several channels, including the society’s record label [[Aurora (record label)|Aurora]], and through collaboration with concert producers and festivals. 

The Society negotiates on behalf of its members in matters concerning remuneration and performing rights. It acts in an advisory capacity to the Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs and is represented on several boards (such as the Norwegian performing rights organization [[TONO]]) and public committees. The Norwegian Society of Composers offers legal, financial and practical aid to its members and provides information for the general public. 

Together with its sister organizations in the Nordic countries, the Norwegian Society of Composers arranges the annual festival [[Nordic Music Days]].

{{refimprove|date=May 2009}}
A '''production coordinator''' (officially called '''production office coordinator''' and abbreviated '''POC''') is a unionized position in [[stagecraft]] under the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) and is governed in Los Angeles by Local 871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ialocal871.org/|title=Local 871's website|publisher=Local 871|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production coordinator serves under the production manager, producer  or UPM to coordinate the various groups and personnel that come together in [[filmmaking]] to a movie and [[video production]] to make a [[television show]]. It is a supervisory  position to the [[Production assistant]] staff. The position requires adept organizational skills, resourcefulness and the ability to handle a  multitude of tasks simultaneously under often high-pressure situations. The POC serves as the gatekeeper of company policy  and is usually responsible for ensuring the rest of the production [[television crew]] follows the requirements of the Production Company or Studio.

The duties of a POC are often undefined and extremely varied ranging from office manager, to human resources, to controller, to accountant. The POC is one of the only positions with the IATSE (USA and Canada) which no longer has a scale or set wage. The IA bylaws simply state the POC’s wage is “subject to negotiation with the Producer”. Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension &amp; Health Plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpiphp.org/faqs/pension_faqs.htm/|title=Motion Picture Pension Plan FAQ|publisher=Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week, which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an "on-call" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week, no matter how many or few hours they work. Working conditions can vary on the medium (half-hour, hour-long television, reality, live, soap and feature) and daily hours can range from 8 to 16 hour days. The POC is often the first person in the office and the last to leave since they hold the responsibility of tending to the needs of the crew. 

More recent attempts have been made by Local 871 to establish a scale rate for the POCs, but to date all have been unsuccessful.

The union has a relaxed jurisdiction over the position since it does not have an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC, but again since it does not have an official job description in its bylaws, many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">'''Res Artis''' is the largest existing network of [[artist residency]] programs, representing  the interests of more than 600 centers, organisations, and individuals in over 70 countries worldwide that offer international artists the optimum conditions for producing art.

Since 1993, through the volunteer efforts of the Board of Directors and countless partners and friends, Res Artis has grown to become the largest network of its kind, promoting the role of residential art programs as a vital part of the contemporary arts world, stimulating the creative development and mobility of artists, and furthering intercultural understanding.

Each of Res Artis' members is dedicated to offering artists, curators, and all manner of creative people the essential time and place away from the pressures and habits of every-day life, an experience framed within a unique geographic and cultural context. Through Res Artis, organisations will become part of a global community of colleagues engaged in dialogue through face-to-face meetings and virtually through an extensive online presence.&lt;ref&gt;Res Artis Website[http://www.resartis.org/en/about/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the organisation include a wide variety of facilities that take may take the form of an [[art colony]], an [[artist-run space]], or other regional residency networks.

The network began in 1993 as an organisation of volunteers who represent and support the needs of residential arts centers and programs through the dynamic exchange of information in the form of publications and through regional and international face-to-face meetings. Res Artis promotes the understanding of the catalytic role residential arts centers play in the development of Contemporary Arts in all cultures worldwide and across all creative media. The organization has been cited in its work to further the international mobility of artists and the promotion of cultural exchange through art residencies.&lt;ref&gt;Haris Pellapaisiotis, "Speaking Thoughts:

==Conferences and meetings==
The heart of the network are our face-to-face meetings. They provide opportunities for our members to meet, discuss, and learn first-hand about the host location. These are venues for sharing experiences, ideas, and meals, getting to know one another not only as colleagues but as people. 

These meetings are organised in partnership with a Res Artis member, a local residency space, or other organisation. Res Artis meetings can focus on a particular theme, issue, profile or geographic region. Documentation from all past meetings and information on upcoming ones can be found on the [http://www.resartis.org/en/meetings/ Res Artis website].

[[File:Konstakademien skulpturmagasin.JPG|thumb|The Royal Academy's sculpture hall in 2010]]
The '''Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts''' ({{lang-sv|Kungliga Akademien för de fria konsterna}}), commonly called the '''Royal Academy''', is located in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. An  independent organization that promotes the development of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fine arts, it is one of several [[Swedish Royal Academies]]. The [[Royal Institute of Art]], an art school that was once an integral part of the Academy, was broken out in 1978 as an independent entity directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.

==History==
In 1735, [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]] set up a drawing school at Stockholm Castle, naming it the '''Royal Drawing Academy'''. It was modeled after French academies of the day as a gathering place for established artists and art connoisseurs. The painters [[Guillaume Taraval]], [[Johan Henrik Scheffel]], and [[Olof Arenius]] and the architect [[Carl Hårleman]] taught there, and the first group of students included [[Johan Pasch]].  

In 1766, the academy expanded its activities following a parliamentary decree. In 1768, its name was changed to the '''Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture'''. In 1773, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] wrote the first statutes for the academy's organization. At the time, the curriculum spanned architecture, graphics, anatomy, theory of perspective, and cultural history. The late 18th century is considered the first golden age of the Royal Academy, when great artists of the time such as [[Johan Tobias Sergel]] were elected as members and also taught there. In 1810, it was renamed again to Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (Swedish: ''Kungliga Akademien för de fria konsterna''), the name it still bears today. 

By the 1830s, there was beginning to be opposition to the Royal Academy's commitment to traditional [[Academic art|academic art]]. In addition, while both men and women could be elected as members of the academy, at the time women could only study art by special permission before 1864, when women students where accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtsson, Eva-Lena ”Konstakademien och Mejan”, i Kungl. Konsthögskolan Vårutställning 2005 (Utställningskatalog), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm Art Association was formed to offer exhibition alternatives, and an Impressionist artist's group known as "The Opponents" arose as well.

==Location==
In 1780, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture moved from Stockholm Castle into a 17th  palace designed by the architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] on Fredsgatan street in the city center. In the years 1842–46 it was redesigned by the architect [[Fredrik Blom]] and an extension was added in 1893–96.

'''Serendipity''' means an unplanned, fortunate  discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serendipity|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/serendipity|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford dictionary|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of scientific innovation. Examples are [[Alexander Fleming]]'s accidental discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928, the invention of the [[microwave oven]] by Percy Spencer  in 1945, and the invention of the [[Post-it note]] by [[Spencer Silver]] in 1968.

In June 2004, a British translation company voted the word to be one of the ten English [[words hardest to translate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Words hardest to translate – The list by Today Translations. Also defined in modern times as "An unexpected discovery occurring by design". Unknown reference updated on 12/14/2014 by Isaac Lucero, Santa Fe, NM USA |publisher=Global Oneness |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125055716/http://experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its sociological use, the word has since been exported into many other languages.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [[portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''serendipicidade'' or ''serendipidade''; French ''sérendipicité'' or ''sérendipité'' but also ''heureux hasard'', "fortunate chance"; Italian ''serendipità'' ([http://dizionari.hoepli.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/serendipita.aspx?idD=1&amp;Query=serendipit%C3%A0&amp;lettera=S Italian Dictionary Hoepli, cfr.]); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''serendipiteit''; German ''Serendipität''; Japanese serendipiti (セレンディピティ); [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''serendipitet''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''serendipitate''; Spanish ''serendipia'', Polish: ''Serendypność''; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''serendipiteetti''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first noted use of "serendipity" in the [[English language]] was by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet|Horace Mann]], Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a (lost) painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-04|title=Lost artworks|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost_artworks&amp;oldid=798895435|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bianca Cappello]] by [[Giorgio Vasari]] by reference to a  Persian fairy tale, ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''. The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Theodore G. |editor-last=Remer |title=Serendipity and the Three Princes, from the Peregrinaggio of 1557 |page=6|others=Edited, with an Introduction and Notes, by Theodore G. Remer. Preface by W. S. Lewis |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1965 }} LCC 65-10112&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from ''[[Names of Sri Lanka#Ceylon, Serendip and related names|Serendip]]'', an old name for [[Sri Lanka]] (Ceylon), hence ''Sarandib'' by Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Robert K. Merton, Elinor|title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity : A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691126305|pages=1–3|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Sanskrit ''Siṃhaladvīpaḥ'' (Siṃhalaḥ, Sri Lanka + dvīpaḥ, island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/serendipity|title=serendipity|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and strategy==
M. E. Graebner describes serendipitous value in the context of the acquisition of a business as "windfalls that were not anticipated by the buyer prior to the deal": i.e., unexpected advantages or benefits incurred due to positive synergy effects of the merger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Ikujiro Nonaka]]&lt;ref&gt;1991, p.&amp;nbsp;94 November–December issue of [[Harvard Business Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the serendipitous quality of innovation is highly recognized by managers and links the success of Japanese enterprises to their ability to create knowledge not by processing information but rather by "tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches of individual employees and making those insights available for testing and use by the company as a whole".

Serendipity is postulated by Napier and Vuong (2013) as a 'strategic advantage' with which a firm can tap its potential creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdjYAQAAQBAJ Napier, Nancy K., and Vuong Quan Hoang. "Serendipity as a strategic advantage?." ''Strategic Management in the 21st Century; edited by Timothy J. Wilkinson.'', '''2013''', ''1'', 175–199.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serendipity is a key concept in [[competitive intelligence]] because it is one of the tools for avoiding blind spots (see [[Blindspots analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html Serendipity in Competitive Intelligence by [[Yves-Michel Marti]], Egideria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827142133/http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

==Uses==
Serendipity is used as a [[sociology|sociological]] method in [[Anselm L. Strauss]]' and [[Barney G. Glaser]]'s ''[[grounded theory]]'', building on ideas by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]], who in ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949) referred to the "serendipity pattern" as the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory. Merton also co-authored (with Elinor Barber) ''The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity'',&lt;ref&gt;Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the origins and uses of the word "serendipity" since it was coined. The book is "a study in sociological semantics and the sociology of science", as the subtitle of the book declares. It further develops the idea of serendipity as scientific "method" (as juxtaposed with purposeful discovery by experiment or retrospective prophecy).

=={{anchor|Zemblanity|Bahramdipity}}Related terms==
[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] coined the term '''zemblanity''' in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: "making unhappy, unlucky and unexpected discoveries occurring by design".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, William. ''Armadillo'', Chapter 12, [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-375-40223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A zemblanity is, effectively, an "unpleasant unsurprise". It derives from [[Novaya Zemlya]] (or Nova Zembla), a cold, barren land with many features opposite to the lush Sri Lanka (Serendip). On this island [[Willem Barents]] and his crew were stranded while searching for a new route to the east.

'''Bahramdipity''' is derived directly from [[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] as characterized in ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''.  It describes the ''suppression'' of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.&lt;ref&gt;(a) [http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1999/feb/opin_990201.html Sommer, Toby J. "'Bahramdipity' and Scientific Research", ''The Scientist'', '''1999''', ''13''(3), 13.] &lt;br /&gt;(b) [http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Sommer.pdf Sommer, Toby J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">'''The Seven and Five Society''' was an [[art group]] of seven painters and five sculptors created in 1919 and based in London.

The group was originally intended to encompass traditional, conservative artistic sensibilities. The first exhibition catalogue said, "[we] feel that there has of late been too much pioneering along too many lines in altogether too much of a hurry." Abstract artist [[Ben Nicholson]] joined in 1924, followed by others such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]], and changed the society into a [[modernist]]ic one and expelled the non-modernist artists. In 1935, the group was renamed the Seven and Five Abstract Group. At the [[Desmond Zwemmer|Zwemmer Gallery]] in [[Charing Cross Road]], London, they staged the first exhibition of entirely abstract works in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/the-seven-and-five-society "Seven and Five Society"], ''Tate''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheer fabric''' is [[textile|fabric]] which is made using thin [[Thread (unit of measurement)|thread]] and/or low density of [[knits|knit]] and which results in a semi-[[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] and flimsy cloth. Some fabrics become [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] when wet. 

==Overview==
The sheerness of a fabric is expressed as a numerical [[Denier (measure)|denier]] which ranges from 3 (extremely rare, very thin, barely visible) to 15 (standard sheer for stockings) up to 30 (semi opaque) until 100 (opaque). The materials which can be made translucent include [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]], [[silk]], [[rayon]] or [[nylon]]. Sheer fabric comes in a wide variety of colors, but for curtains, white and shades of white, such as cream, winter white, eggshell, and ivory are popular. In some cases, sheer fabric is embellished with embroidered patterns or designs.

[[File:Chorwacja, widok z wyspy Ciovo na wyspę Solta.JPG|thumb|right|Sheer curtains]]
[[Image:Pantyhose2.jpg|thumb|right|Sheer [[pantyhose]] made from nylon]]

A common use for sheer fabric is in curtains, which allows for sunlight to pass through during daylight, while maintaining a level of privacy. Due to the loose weave in sheer fabrics curtains offer little heat insulation. However, when it is lighter on the inside of a room than it is on the outside (such as at nighttime), then the inside of the room can be seen from the outside.

Sheer fabric is used in clothing, in garments such as stockings or tights and in dancewear and lingerie, and sometimes as part of clothing, such as in [[wedding gown]]s and formal costumes. Sheer fabric for clothing offers very little in the way of warmth for the wearer, and for this reason is commonly worn in hot weather. It offers relatively low [[Sun protective clothing|sun protection]].

Though sheer stockings have been popular since the 1920s, and have been used in women's nightwear for some time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seriously Sensual|url=https://www.seriouslysensual.co.uk/nightwear/|website=Nightwear|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the use of sheer fabrics in other clothing has become more common in recent years. There was a predominant sheer fashion trend in fashion circles since 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.theage.com.au/2010/02/15/1123369/600-GALL-BEGG-SS7-600x400.jpg The Age: 15/2/10 - 2010 Allan Border Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; with sheer fabrics being used in tight clothes, layers, and in delicate feminine draping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Sheer-fashion-trend-2009-2010-953.html Sheer fashion trend: 2009 &amp; 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine is a large gilded and decorated triple [[sarcophagus]] placed above and behind the [[high altar]] of [[Cologne Cathedral]].  It is considered the high point of [[Mosan art]] and the largest reliquary in the western world.

==History==
[[Image:Dreikönigenschrein köln.JPG|right|thumb|Another view]]

The "[[relics]] of the Magi" were originally situated at [[Constantinople]], but brought to Milan in an oxcart by [[Eustorgius I]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|city's bishop]], to whom they were entrusted by the [[Emperor Constantine]] in 314.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lowenthal|Lowenthal, David]] (1998); ''The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight centuries later in 1164, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick Barbarossa]] took the [[relic]]s of the Magi from the church of [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio|Saint Eustorgio]] in [[Milan]] and gave them to the [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/unearthed/videos/cologne-cathedral-supposedly-has-the-bones-of-the-three-wise-men|title=Cologne Cathedral Supposedly has the Bones of the Three Wise Men - Unearthed {{!}} Science|website=www.sciencechannel.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kings have since attracted a constant stream of [[pilgrim]]s to [[Cologne]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the days of [[Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne|Philipp of Heinsberg]] the shrine of the three magi was built. This was told to me by some eyewitnesses who were present when the three magi were put into the shrine." — [[Eustorgius I#Legend|Vita Eustorgii]]&lt;ref&gt;Latin original:
:"Temporibus domini Philippi episcopi, qui successit Reinoldo, fabricata  est eis capsa ... sicut nobis narraverunt qui presentes erant eorum translatoni ... " (Floss, ''Dreikoenigenbuch'', 1864, page 116-122 (Latin); copy in MGH 25, 108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Parts of the shrine were designed by the famous medieval goldsmith [[Nicholas of Verdun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koelner-dom.de/rundgang/bedeutendewerke/shrine-of-the-magi-circa-1190-1220/info/?L=1|title=Der Hohe Dom zu Köln - Kathedrale und Weltkulturerbe -  Gebaut für Gott und die Menschen|last=Köln|first=Cologne Digital Medienproduktion GmbH,|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who began work on it in 1180 or 1181. It has elaborate gold sculptures of the prophets and apostles, and scenes from the life of Christ.  The shrine was completed circa 1225.

Around 1199, King [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]] gave three golden crowns made for the three wise men as a present to the church of Cologne: "Otto rex coloniensis curiam celebrans tres coronas de auro capitibus trium magorum imposuit"; MGSS 17, 292.  Because of the importance of the shrine and the cathedral for the later development of the city, the [[Coat of Arms]] of Cologne still shows these three crowns symbolizing the Three Kings.

Construction of the present Cologne Cathedral begun in 1248 to house these important relics. The cathedral took 632 years to complete and is now the largest [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Church (building)|church]] in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/22/beyond-fiction-8-unknown-facts-about-pulp-fiction/|title=Beyond Fiction: unknown facts about Pulp Fiction|date=2017-04-22|work=The Vintage News|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1864, the shrine was opened, and remains of the Three Kings and the coins of [[Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne]] were discovered. An eyewitness report reads:

:"In a special compartment of the shrine now there showed - along with remains of ancient old rotten or moulded bandages, most likely byssus, besides pieces of aromatic resins and similar substances - numerous bones of three persons, which under the guidance of several present experts could be assembled into nearly complete bodies: the one in his early youth, the second in his early manhood, the third was rather aged. Two coins, bracteates made of silver and only one side striken, were adjoined; one, probably from the days of ''Philipps von Heinsberg'', displayed a church (''See Note''), the other showed a cross, accompanied by the sword of jurisdiction, and the crosier (bishop's crook) on either side."&lt;ref&gt;German original:
:"In einer besonderen Abteilung des Schreins zeigten sich nun mit den Resten uralter vermoderter Binden, wahrscheinlich Byssus, nebst Stuecken aromatischer Harze und aehnlicher Substanzen die zahlreichen Gebeine dreier Personen, die mit Beihilfe der anwesenden Sachverstaendigen sich zu fast vollstaendigen Koerpern ordnen liessen: der eine aus erster Jugendzeit, der zweite im ersten Mannesalter, der dritte bejahrt. Zwei Muenzen, Bracteaten von Silber und nur auf einer Seite gepraegt, lagen bei; die eine, erweislich aus den Tagen Philipps von Heinsberg, zeigt eine Kirche (''See Note''), die andere ein Kreuz, das Jurisdictionsschwert an der einen, den Bischofsstab an der anderen Seite. (Floss, ''Dreikoenigenbuch'', 1864, page 108)&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Note'': "Just as the coin of Philipp in ''Hartzheim, historia rei nummariae coloniensis'' Table 3 No. 14, 16, (1754),&lt;ref&gt;Hartzheim, Josephus, ''Historia Rei Nummariæ Coloniensis, Et Dissertationes De Eadem: Pars prima, De Nummis Archiepiscoporum Coloniensium, Pars Secunda, De Nummis Ducum Juliacensium &amp; Montensium, &amp; Agnatorum Genti Juliacensi, Pars Tertia. De Nummis Civitatis Coloniensis'', 1754&lt;/ref&gt; yet without its circumscription; the other (coin) is in square form, showed in the center a cross, accompanied by the sword of jurisdiction, and the crosier (bishop's crook) on either side, also without transcription, most certainly it is not younger and can be assumed perhaps to turn out to be a coin by Rainald [of Dassel].")&lt;ref&gt;German original:
:"Ganz so wie die Muenze Philipps bei Hartzheim historia rei nummariae coloniensis  Tafel 3 Nr. 14, 16, doch ohne die Umschrift; die andere in viereckiger Form, in der Mitte ein Kreuz, das Jurisdictionsschwert an der einen, den Bischofsstab an der anderen Seite, auch ohne Umschrift, ist jedenfalls nicht juenger und duerfte sich vielleicht als eine Muenze Rainald's erweisen." (Floss, ''Dreikoenigenbuch'', 1864, page 108)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones were wrapped in white [[silk]] and returned to the shrine.

==Description==
[[Image:Cologne Dreikoenigsschrein Koelner Dom.jpg|thumb]]

===Size and construction===
The Shrine of the Three Kings is approximately 43&amp;nbsp;inches (110&amp;nbsp;cm) wide, 60&amp;nbsp;inches (153&amp;nbsp;cm) high, and 87&amp;nbsp;inches (220&amp;nbsp;cm) long.  It is shaped like a [[basilica]]: two sarcophagi stand next to each other, with the third sarcophagus resting on their roof ridges.  The ends are completely covered, so there is no space visible between the sarcophagi.  The basic structure is made of [[wood]], with [[gold]] and [[silver]] overlay decorated with [[filigree]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and over 1000 [[gemstone|jewels]] and beads.  The latter include a large number of [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]s and [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] pieces, some pre-Christian.

===Decoration===
The entire outside of the shrine is covered with an elaborate decorative overlay.  There are 74 [[high relief]] figures in [[silver-gilt]] in all, not counting smaller additional figures in the background decoration. On the sides, images of the [[prophet]]s decorate the lower part, while images of the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]]s decorate the upper part.  On one end, there are (across the bottom, from left to right) images of the [[Adoration of the Magi in Art|Adoration of the Magi]], [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] enthroned with the infant [[Jesus]], and the [[Baptism]] of Christ, and above, Christ enthroned at the [[Last Judgement]]. The other end shows scenes of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]:  the [[scourging]] of Christ (lower left) and his [[crucifixion]] (lower left) with the [[resurrection|resurrected]] Christ above.  This end also has a bust of [[Rainald of Dassel]] in the center.

==The shrine in fiction==
In the novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' (2000), [[Umberto Eco]] describes the discovery and subsequent donation of the Magi's relics as an elaborate 12th century [[hoax]] perpetrated by the title character.

In the novel ''Map of Bones'' (2005) by [[James Rollins]], the Shrine contains gold in its [[monatomic]] state, produced by the [[Magi]], as opposed to holy relics.

In the novel "The Bishop and the Three Kings," bishop-detective [[Father John Blackwood "Blackie" Ryan]] must solve the mysterious theft of the shrine ([[Andrew Greeley]], 1998).

'''Steven B. Smith''' (born 1946 in [[Wallace, Idaho]]), is an [[underground art]]ist and [[poet]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He published ''[[ArtCrimes]]'', a zine influenced by the [[beat poetry|beats]].&lt;ref name="Utter" /&gt; Smith's art and poetry uses cultural themes as found objects with a [[Dadaism|Dadaist]] influence.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, Sally. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1984_d.html "Spiritual Fulfillment,"] ''Dialogue Magazine'' (Sept., 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Litt"&gt;Litt, Steven. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1992.html "Aggressive Nastiness Jabs At Viewer,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (May 27, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

His life is pockmarked with colorful episodes such as stealing cars when he was thirteen, getting kicked out of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], armed robbery, and prison.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Utter2"&gt;Utter, Douglas Max. [http://agentofchaos.com/prisonbreak.html "Over the Wall: The Restless Steven B. Smith Is Moving On,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (Mar. 15, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Smith was born in Wallace, Idaho, to Pappy Smith and Florence E. "Mother Dwarf" Smith. He was raised in Paradise Prairie, twenty miles outside of [[Spokane, Washington]]. He stole thirteen cars when he was thirteen.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In 1968 Smith was one of thirteen [[Midshipmen|middies]] ousted by the Naval Academy for smoking [[Marijuana|pot]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, Bart. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1968.html "13 Middies Ousted In Marijuana Case,"] ''The Washington Post'' (Feb. 21, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; He haggled a deal with the government upon discharge; they agreed to pay for his education.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt; He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy with a 3.8 GPA from [[Loyola College in Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Cullinan"&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1993.html "Angry Young Artist Has Mellowed With Age,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Sept. 30, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith married into an East Coast [[Nobility|blue-blood]] family in 1969.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; In 1970, he was arrested for armed robbery. [http://agentofchaos.com/prisonbreak.html] Smith lived in Baltimore and other cities before coming to Cleveland in 1977&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; in pursuit of another man's wife.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; She then divorced her husband and decided to marry someone other than Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Putre, Laura. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1996.html "Blurb,"] ''The Scene'' (Apr. 26, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Smith's [[Assemblage art|art assemblages]] started when one day, instead of painting a key on a canvas, he picked it up and pasted it onto the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, Michael. [http://agentofchaos.com/heaton_030418.html "Nothing can save your life like a really good art attack,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Apr. 18, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's art uses iconic baubles with the effect of cheapening and attacking cultural themes.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; The work has been characterized as "difficult and uncompromising,"&lt;ref name="Sparks2"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988.html "A Place to Call Home,"] ''Cleveland Edition'' (Sept. 8, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and "repellent and grotesque," with roots from the [[dadaist]] collages of [[Kurt Schwitters|Schwitters]] and [[Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt;

Materials used include rusted wire, shattered glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, the artificial leg of a dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; His work is washed in blue "corrosion," a mix of [[Liquitex|matte medium]], copper powder, and salt.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Frank. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1994.html "Alchemy In Reverse,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Apr. 20, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith uses cultural themes as found objects.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; "I deal in symbolic juxtapositions of the odd and unwanted," Smith says. "My materials consist of cultural castoffs, sociological implications and the refuse known as suburban thought. My goals are simple; erase your labels; learn to look about ... Learn to see dead frog and rust and thus re-see yourself."&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; He says, "My art is a collaboration with the pieces."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

After the death of his brother Cat (Vincent Smith), Smith started exhibiting his brother's remains at his shows, leaving some of the ashes behind after each exhibit.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;

==Notoriety==

Smith first gained notoriety with a piece — ''American Ego'' — in the People's Art Show at CSU. His piece was a four-by-three grid of [[Instant film|Polaroid]] snapshots, nude photos of himself in compromising positions with the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, James. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1984.html "Must Be Profound,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Dec. 3, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; This piece won the "most outrageous" award at the show.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Next, three pieces of his art were censored from a show at [[Tri-C]] West. Smith agreed to the removal as long as a "censored" notice was put on the wall in place of the missing art. The opening night poetry reading was reassigned to a remote conference room. During the reading Smith discovered that Tri-C neglected to post the notes. He wrote "CENSORED" on the wall with a ball point pen. Poet [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]] decided to read in the original gallery, and mouthed the words to his poem silently as a Tri-C co-director sanded the words off the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1986.html "Censorship Charges Mar Tri-C West Show"] ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' (May 1, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Smith worked longest as a computer programmer, which helped support ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' and his art. He frequently contracted with [[BP]]. Previous occupations include sailor, milk man, life insurance salesman, avant garde theater manager, newspaper film and music critic, woman's shoe salesmen, prison cook, carnival laborer, and church janitor. He's also worked at [[Bethlehem Steel]].&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

==Cleveland Warehouse District==

Smith and his friend and frequent collaborator S. Judson Wilcox were two early "urban pioneers": artists who settled the [[The Warehouse District|Warehouse District]] in Cleveland in 1981.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, Elizabeth. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1987_b.html "Art Behind Bars,"] ''Dialogue Magazine'' (July 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, musicians and renegades moved there to revel in Cleveland's industrial beauty.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; The warehouse district was a haven.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Smith and Wilcox had an "Art Behind Bars" installation in the district with mannequins, Mickey Mouse, and neon tube calliope.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt;

Smith's brother "Cat" moved into the warehouse with him.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; Cat Smith's collages were dead ringers for Schwitters'.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Smith and Cat's spot in the warehouse became a gathering spot for other artists in the building, and scene, including S. Judson Wilcox, Melissa Jay Craig (AKA "Field Marshal May Midwest"), Jeff Chiplis, Laszlo Gyorki, Ken Nevadomi, Randy Rigutto, Jay Clements, and Beth Wolfe.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; Guests were offered keepsakes of miniature toy soldiers, babies in plastic bubbles, or poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken.  [http://agentofchaos.com/review1998.html "Howling at the Edge of a Renaissance: SPACES and Alternative Art in Cleveland, 1978-1998,"] Performance Art Festival catalogue (Sept. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

SPACES Gallery was located on the first floor, making the warehouse the [[de facto]] epicenter of creative activity.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Cat was a troubled man who eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; After he died, Smith heard a beeping in his studio. He couldn't figure out where the beeping came from, and thought it was the soul of his dead brother. He then found a worn-out smoke detector at the bottom of a huge pile in his studio.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In another installation with Wilcox, Smith used a bag of his dead brother's ashes. He claimed to have a pact with Cat. The first to die would be included in an exhibition of the other's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988_a.html "Ashes to Ashes, Poet to Artist,"] ''The Cleveland Plain Dealer''
(July 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the exhibitions at SPACES gallery, Smith put Cat's ashes on a pedestal. The bag was punctured by a friend and ashes spilled onto the pedestal and the floor.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==''ArtCrimes''==
{{main|ArtCrimes}}
Before making visual art, Smith crafted unique journals into which he'd juxtapose images and poetry and journal entries.&lt;ref name="Sparks"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/surreal_thing.html "Surreal Thing: Eccentric Artist and Collector Steve Smith Bares All,"] ''Free Times'' (Mar. 15-21, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wrote clever, punning poetry and read it all over town. (His poetry is described as "a stream-of-consciousness assault on reason and order" and "a cross between Dada and [[Jack Kerouac]].")&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt; Smith used his art and poetry to make political statements, and he also participated in a couple legendary "regional art terrorist" raids in the [[Flats District (Cleveland)|Flats]].&lt;ref name="Sparks"/&gt;

Starting in 1986, Smith published the Cleveland [[Underground art|cult underground publication]] ''[[ArtCrimes]]'', a zine full of images and poems which also shared his disrespect for authority. ''ArtCrimes'' took on the spirit of Smith's journals, like a sketchbook that's been passed around to dozens of different artists.&lt;ref name="Tranberg"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/plaindealer_acarticle_0802.html "Art Matters: Underground publication carries on as a quiet force,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (August 2, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly"&gt;Bly, Lyz. [http://agentofchaos.com/dwarf/review050511.html "Capturing the Smiths: Mother Dwarf's collages evoke an often painful family history,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (May 11, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The zine was influenced by the [[beat (music)|beats]],&lt;ref name="Utter"&gt;Utter, Douglas Max. [http://agentofchaos.com/utter0608.html "Criminals At Large: Steven B. Smith's Farewell ''ArtCrimes'' Is His Best Ever,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (August 9, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and was consistent with the style of publications from the days of [[Kerouac]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], and [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]].

Contributors included everyone from [[Charles Bukowski|Bukowski]] and [[Jack Micheline|Micheline]] to people's pets. Ohio poets and artists included the likes of [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]], Maj Ragain, Amy Bracken Sparks, Ben Gulyas, Chris Franke, [[Harvey Pekar]], [[Gary Dumm]], [[Masumi Hayashi (photographer)|Masumi Hayashi]] and Ken Nevadomi.&lt;ref name="Budimir"&gt;Budimir, Milenko. [http://agentofchaos.com/budimir_0606.html "Crimes-free Cleveland:  The city’s agent of chaos takes on a new mission,"] ''Northern Ohio Live'' (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer postulated that ''ArtCrimes'' was the most significant publication of the Cleveland underground art scene in recent history.&lt;ref name="Utter" /&gt;

==Tremont==

The affordability of Cleveland neighborhoods periodically caused mass migrations of artists. In the 1980s, Smith was one of the urban pioneers to move into the Warehouse District.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; In '85, he was one of many artists who moved from the warehouses to [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]], in the typical pattern where artists move into undesirable but inexpensive neighborhoods, fixing up old buildings in which to live and work.&lt;ref name="Sparks2" /&gt;

Shortly after Smith's move to Tremont, Cat committed suicide. Pappy Smith died shortly after, and Mother Dwarf (Florence E. Smith) left Las Vegas to come to live with Smith.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks3"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1993_b.html "A Most Common Name, A Most Unusual Family,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Aug. 11, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Dwarf began her art career producing collages for ''[[ArtCrimes]]''.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt; Smith and his mother's life together became a mother-son artistic collaboration.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith nearly died in 1991 from alcohol, and has been sober since then.&lt;ref name="Sparks3" /&gt; One notable drunken episode was after an art auction. He'd bid loudly on every piece offered. He took a walk home with Mother Dwarf. He passed a fence of barking dogs, and started to howl "in communion." He leaned up over the dogs and they bit his scalp. The next day, Smith asked Mother Dwarf why he was covered in blood. "You mean..." she said, "You don't remember the dogs?"&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==Recent==

In an interview in 2000, Smith claimed his voice was raspy "because I don't talk to anyone anymore." He'd become a recluse whose doormat said "Go Away."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; He said, "I had to learn silence. People only remember the old days when I shocked people with what I said or made or did. But there's a lot of beauty in the things I've done."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In 2005 Smith's life hit a series of highs and lows. His mother died, he fell in love, he retired, and then discovered he had throat cancer. He published the final issue of ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/tranberg060505.html "Art Matters With Dan Tranberg: Emigrating artist Steven Smith holds 'liquidation sale' exhibit,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (May 5, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith is a [[documentarian]]. His journals are not the only documentation of his life. He continues with his 2500-page website agentofchaos.com.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith married poet Lady K in 2006. They began their relationship shortly after the death of Mother Dwarf in 2005.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt; In 2006 Smith and his wife sold their home, gave away all of their possessions, and moved to Europe.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2" /&gt;

'''''Tango Argentino''''' is a musical stage production about the history and many varieties of [[Argentine tango]].  It was created and directed by Hector Orezzoli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/nyregion/hector-orezzoli-is-dead-at-38-won-tonys-for-black-and-blue.html|title=Hector Orezzoli Is Dead at 38; Won Tonys for 'Black and Blue'|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Claudio Segovia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-16|title=Claudio Segovia|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claudio_Segovia&amp;oldid=104947035|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered at the Festival d'Automne in [[Paris]] in 1983 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] ( New York ) in 1985. The production became a world-wide success with numerous tours culminating with a Broadway revival in 1999-2000.  It set off a world-wide resurgence of tango, both as a social dance and as a musical genre.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  ''Tango Argentino'' recreates on stage the history of tango from its beginnings in 19th Century [[Buenos Aires]] through the tango's golden age of the 1940s and 50s up to [[Astor Piazzolla|Piazzolla]]'s tangos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1985/10/28/the-tango|title=The Tango|last=Boutwell|first=Jane|date=1985-10-21|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the dancers in the show did their own choreography.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/production/tango-argentino-mark-hellinger-theatre-vault-0000005777|title=Tango Argentino Broadway @ Mark Hellinger Theatre - Tickets and Discounts {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Tango Argentino'' was a totally unexpected hit.  It violated all the rules— It was low budget, used a single set, and showcased slim, athletic professional dancers, such as [[Nelson Avila]], along with middle-aged dancers, such as [[Argentine tango|Verulazo]], all on the same stage. The average age of the cast was 42 years.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All this glamour attends a show that even Argentines wouldn't invest in at the outset, a show that made it to Broadway largely by accident, a show that has one set, four accordions (called bandoneons) and a couple of 38-inch waistlines.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ([[Samuel G. Freedman|Samuel G. Friedman]], NY Times 1985)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
In 1974, Hector Orezzoli and Claudio Segovia, two Argentine set designers, decided to put together a production about tango using the best dancers in all of Argentina. Claudio Segovia recounted that he wanted to reflect on stage the reality of tango life in [[Buenos Aires]], therefore he looked for an authentic mixture of the different types of musicians and dancers, of children, young people and mature people: ''"Elegí gente que según mi juicio era la más auténtica, la más verdadera, y creo que no me equivoqué."'' [I chose people who, in my opinion, were the most authentic, the truest (tango artists), and I think I was not wrong.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.elpais.com.uy/Suple/Cultural/03/12/26/cultural_73101.asp|title=Suplemento Cultural|last=Falcoff|first=Laura|date=2013-11-10|website=Web.archive.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110231923/http://www3.elpais.com.uy/Suple/Cultural/03/12/26/cultural_73101.asp|archive-date=2013-11-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Solos ===

==== Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves ====
Claudio Segovia went looking for accomplished tango dancers in Buenos Aires.  He approached [[Juan Carlos Copes]] and [[María Nieves|Maria Nieves]], who ran one of the most popular tango shows in the city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By the mid-1970s, Copes and Nieves had been dancing tango together most of their lives. They had begun in a working class dance hall in 1940s Buenos Aires when they were in their teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/15/arts/it-takes-two-who-tango.html|title=IT TAKES TWO WHO TANGO|last=Kleiman|first=Dena|date=October 15, 1985|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1950s, interest in tango had begun to wane due in part to a regressive government that discouraged public gatherings and later due to the cultural phenomenon of the Beatles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/culture/copes-nieves-saved-tango-1-5211933|title=The couple who saved tango|last=European|first=The New|date=27 September 2017|work=The New European|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Copes had such a love for the dance, that he decided he would not accept the death of tango.  Being a lover of [[Gene Kelly]]’s dance films, he decided in 1955 to do something similar with tango. He began to rehearse tango choreographies, together with Maria Nieves and other tango dancers in the basement of a factory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Their shows soon became popular in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Copes expressed doubts that a group of tango artists, who were often known for their huge egos, could ever work together long enough to stage such a production.  He thought the idea of the show was crazy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Eventually Copes and Nieves joined the cast of ''Tango Argentino''.

==== Nelson Avila and Nélida Rodriguez ====
Segovia also approached the well-known stage dancers Nelson and Nélida.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Nelson Avila]] and Nélida Rodriguez de Aure were dancing and directing the choreography at the famous Michelangelo tango show in [[San Telmo, Buenos Aires|San Telmo]] at the time. They had already been dancing together in the most prominent shows in Buenos Aires, had appeared together numerous times on television, and had performed internationally. They were noted for the speed of their dance and their acrobatic steps.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Nelson and Nélida joined the cast.

==== Héctor and Elsa Maria Mayoral ====
The next couple added to the cast was Mayoral&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-05|title=Héctor Mayoral|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H%C3%A9ctor_Mayoral&amp;oldid=107570304|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elsa Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-17|title=Elsa María|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elsa_Mar%C3%ADa&amp;oldid=104960958|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They danced a different style than the others.  They came from the tango salons and danced the very simple, yet very graceful dance of the crowded milonga salons of Buenos Aires. Their tango was noted for its small. playful steps.  Together with Copes &amp; Nieves and Nelson &amp; Nélida, they comprised the three couples who were asked to perform solo routines in the original ''Tango Argentino.''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== The Milongueros ===
[[File:TangoArgentino-Carlos&amp;MariaRivarola-Obelisco2011.jpg|thumb|Carlos &amp; Maria Rivarola performing in Tango Argentino at Obelisco, Buenos Aires 2011]]

==== Virulazo and Elvira Santamaría ====

With the solo routines set, Segovia needed more [[Milonguero|milongueros]], the social dancers from the salons, to complete the show.  Nelson Avila suggested some good friends,  who were well respected street dancers in Buenos Aires,  Virulazo&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and Elvira Santamaría.  When Nelson and Nélida went to look for the couple, they found that Virulazo had quit tango, having become disouraged with the lack of money.  Nelson went out searching for him in his old neighborhoods, but Verulazo was nowhere to be found. Anton Gazenbeek describes what happened next in his book ''Inside Tango Argentino''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  When Nelson finally found Virulazo, he was working in a butcher shop with a blood-covered apron and he was noticeably overweight.  Nelson described the new tango show to him, but Verulazo had no interest at all.  He was done with tango.  When they mentioned an audition for the show,  Verulazo replied that he didn't need to audition for anyone: People already knew he was a great dancer, he had no interest in auditioning.  When Nelson finally talked Virulazo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/creadores/biografia/170/Virulazo/|title=Biografía de Virulazo por Guillermo Alfieri - Todotango.com|website=www.todotango.com|language=es|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elvira into dancing for Segovia, any doubts about their tango disappeared. They were quickly added to the cast.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== María and Carlos Rivarola and the balance of the cast ====
The well known salon tango&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verytangostore.com/salon-style.html|title=Tango de Salon Style of Dancing - description and videos|website=www.verytangostore.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; dancers [[Carlos Rivarola|Carlos]] and [[María Rivarola]] were added to the cast,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/1660/Carlos-Rivarola/|title=Biography of Carlos Rivarola|last=Rivarola|first=Carlos|date=|website=www.todotango.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mónica and Luciano Frías, and Cecilia Narova completed the original cast of dancers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
[[File:MaríaNieves-TangoArgentino.jpg|thumb|Maria Nieves dancing at Tango Argentino, presented in the Obelisco, Buenos Aires, 2011]]
=== The Music ===

==== The Instrumentals ====
Music for ''Tango Argentino'' was provided by ''Sexteto Mayor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-15|title=Sexteto Mayor|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexteto_Mayor&amp;oldid=107055272|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The sextet in Argentine tango was first established by [[Julio de Caro|Julio De Caro]] in 1924. The traditional [[Tango music|tango sextet]]  consists of [[piano]], [[double bass]], two [[violins]] and two [[Bandoneon|bandoneón]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.  Sexteto Mayor had been formed in 1973 by bandoneon players and arrangers Jose Libertella and Luiz Stazo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pandora.com/artist/full-bio/sexteto-mayor/ARtk59KKJlj2d7g|title=Sexteto Mayor|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=|website=Pandora|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1981, they were playing in Paris and Segovia approached Libertella and Stazo with his idea.  ''Sexteto Mayor'' provided the music for both the Paris performance and the first Broadway performance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Together they put together a musical arrangement that followed the origins of Argentine tango from its beginnings in the 19th Century to the [[nuevo tango]] of [[Astor Piazzolla|Piazzolla]].

Originally Segovia had hoped to use the orchestra of the great [[Aníbal Troilo]]; however, Troilo had died in 1975.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In homage to [[Aníbal Troilo]], every performance of ''Tango Argentino'' begins and ends with ''Quejas de bandoneón''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ElCachafaz09|title=ANIBAL TROILO "Quejas de bandoneon "[HQ]|date=2011-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y32Gn-Z4DFk|accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was Troilo's signature piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-14|title=Quejas de bandoneón|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quejas_de_bandone%C3%B3n&amp;oldid=99837254|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to ''Sexteto Mayor'', Segovia recruited the great [[Horacio Salgán]] to complete the music.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/horacio-salgan-argentine-tango-composer-and-musical-pathbreaker-dies-at-100/2016/08/23/bc075688-688f-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html|title=Horacio Salgán, Argentine tango composer and musical pathbreaker, dies at 100|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=2016-08-23|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Vocalists ====
In his book ''Tango: The Art History of Love'', [[Robert Farris Thompson]] describes tango as music, poetry and dance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The poetry of tango is expressed through its songs.  To complete the tango experience for the audience, Segovia included vocal performances by some of the best tango singers in Argentina. [[Jovita Luna|Jovita Lu]][[Jovita Luna|na]] and [[Raúl Lavié|Raú]][[Raúl Lavié|l Lavié]] performed in the original cast from Paris to Broadway. [[Roberto Goyeneche]] sang at the world premier in Paris.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Elba Berón&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-23|title=Elba Berón|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elba_Ber%C3%B3n&amp;oldid=101317965|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; sang at the 1985 Broadway premier.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
[[File:Raúl Lavié (cropped).jpg|thumb|Touring internationally in 1985 with ''Tango Argentino'', Raúl Lavié's voice was in great demand among Tango fans in Argentina and elsewhere.]]
=== Choreography and Production ===
The concept of ''Tango Argentino'' was to present the history of tango through its music, song and dance.  With the many dance styles among the cast members, each couple was given the flexibility to do much of their own choreography.  One problem was that there are no videos of the early 20th century dancers.  When trying to choreograph the beginnings of tango dance, Segovia and the dancers took original still photographs from the early days of tango and laid them out in such an order as to allow them to recreate the original dance of the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Thus audiences were able to visualize the evolution of Argentine tango as both music and dance.

Unfortunately for all their hard work, the show found little support in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-10|title=Tango Argentino (espectáculo)|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tango_Argentino_(espect%C3%A1culo)&amp;oldid=106123567|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; They even had difficulty finding places to rehearse. Few Argentines thought the show had any chances of success.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Paris ==
In 1983, they finally got a break. They were invited to perform in Paris. On a minimal budget, the entire cast of ''Tango Argentino'' boarded an Argentine military transport headed to Paris. The Argentine Air Force cargo plane provided no services; they flew as cargo.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=megvbC2bVZIC&amp;dq=Thompson,+Robert+Farris.+Tango:+The+Art+History+of+Love.|title=Tango: The Art History of Love|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=9781400095797|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been afforded the opportunity to participate in the Festival d'Automne.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=imxaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C2%A0Festival+d'Automne+tango+argentino&amp;dq=%C2%A0Festival+d'Automne+tango+argentino|title=Tango Argentino|date=1986|publisher=Playbill|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was an immediate success. The first performance in Paris received so many loud standing ovations, that [[Nelson Avila]] and Nélida stood at the front of the stage and wept after their solo performance, further exciting the crowd.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The show sold out for every performance with crowds standing outside the theatre unable to get tickets. The show was in such demand that it made a second tour of Italy and Paris the next year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
== Broadway ==
By 1985, ''Tango Argentino'' appeared on Broadway. Unfortunately, [[Nelson Avila]], one of the main performers, broke his arm before the first performance, and it was in a full cast. Nelson had the doctors break the cast in two and hinged it at the elbow so he could bend his arm a little, and he danced the show with a broken arm. Also appearing were Jorge Martin Orcaizaguirre [Virulazo] and Elvira Santa Maria, [[Juan Carlos Copes]] and Maria Nieves. 
''Tango Argentino''  received rave reviews from the New York critics.  The show was such an immediate success that many celebrities attended the show, including Frank Sinatra, Madonna, Brooke Astor, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Helen Gurley Brown, Henry Kissinger and Claus von Bulow. Régine Zylberberg of Regine's invited the cast to dinner. Dance instructors in New York saw the demand for Argentine tango instruction triple overnight.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/19/theater/tango-argentino-the-season-s-improbable-hit.html|title='TANGO ARGENTINO,' THE SEASON'S IMPROBABLE HIT|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G.|date=December 19, 1985|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of the dancers and the simple elegance of tango struck home with audiences who had no concept of Argentine tango before seeing the show. Russell St. Cyr, writing for ''[[The Miscellany News]]'', the [[Vassar College]] newspaper, suggested that the production be considered for a [[Tony Award]] and was impressed with the quality of the production: &lt;blockquote&gt;The dancers have each developed different styles, and they have brought the tango's entire rainbow to the same stage. One would never think that a simple dance could have so much diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newspaperarchive.vassar.edu/cgi-bin/vassar?a=d&amp;d=miscellany19861107-01.2.27&amp;txq=%22tango+argentino%22|title=Miscellany News 7 November 1986 — Vassar Newspaper Archive|last=St. Cyr|first=Russell|date=7 November 1986|website=newspaperarchive.vassar.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Tango Argentino'' did not receive any Tony Awards, although it received numerous Tony Award nominations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsshowinfo.php?showname=Tango%20Argentino|title=Tango Argentino Tony Awards Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominations included the 1986 Tony Award for the Best Choreography&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-20|title=40th Tony Awards|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=40th_Tony_Awards&amp;oldid=816368236|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the 1986 Tony Award for the Best Direction of a Musical&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;; the 1986 Tony Award for the Best Musical&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and for the revival in 1999 the 2000 Tony Award for the Best Revival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-06|title=54th Tony Awards|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=54th_Tony_Awards&amp;oldid=804048059|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Tour ==
''Tango Argentino'' became a world-wide hit, touring the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/38d9cab1cafa21847bcde3d51ebd8574/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2041861|title=Take Two for the Tango: Born on the fringes of Buenos Aires about 100 years ago, the tango is enjoying new popularity during the U.S. tour of the revue "Tango Argentino"|last=Parker|first=Robert A.|date=Sep 1986|website=search.proquest.com|series=Vol. 38, Iss. 5,  (Sep 1986)|publisher=Americas; Washington|page=32–35, 64|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then Japan (1987).  On numerous tours around the world, the cast of ''Tango Argentno'' danced before the likes of [[Princess Diana]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Ann Miller]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Rudolph Nureyev]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Robert DeNiro]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], and [[Placido Domingo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nelsonavilatango.com/About_Nelson.html|title=A Tribute to Nelson Avila|last=Cowley|first=Vic|date=|website=|access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It continued to tour the world for another 15 years with many of its original cast members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The final Broadway revival occurred in 1999-2000.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2011 there was a performance at the [[Obelisco de Buenos Aires|Obelisco]] in Buenos Aires with a few of the original artists including [[María Nieves|Maria Nieves]] and [[Raúl Lavié]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Impact ==
When the dancers of ''Tango Argentino'' took the stage on November 11, 1983,  at the Festival d'Automne in Paris, France, many consider it a turning point in the history of tango.  The world of Argentine tango would never be the same. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] in the preface to his book ''Tango: The Art History of Love'' states "In the 1980s Buenos Aires barrio dancers sparked the strongest renaissance of the twentieth century, through their performance in the stage extravaganza ''Tango Argentino."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=megvbC2bVZIC&amp;dq=Thompson,+Robert+Farris.+Tango:+The+Art+History+of+Love.|title=Tango: The Art History of Love|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|year=|isbn=9781400095797|location=|pages=17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tango historian [[Alberto Paz]] credits ''Tango Argentino'' with the world-wide revival of Argentine tango:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Tango Argentino''' appeared for the first time on an international stage at the '''Paris Autumn Festival''', which began on November 11, 1983. That run lasted one week, but those few days were enough to change history: the tango as dance resurfaced with an unexpected force, and became huge around the world. There has never been a time in history when so many social dancers are dancing Argentine tango as it was danced in the golden years of the 1940s and ’50s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elfirulete.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/a-show-named-tango-argentino/|title=A show named Tango Argentino|last=Paz|first=Alberto|date=2013-11-14|work=EL FIRULETE|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the epilogue of his book ''Inside Tango Argentino,'' Antón Gazenbeek&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tango-dancers.com/anton-gazenbeek/|title=Antón Gazenbeek {{!}} Tango|website=tango-dancers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that the lure of the production was its "humanity:" The average age of the dancers in the original ''Tango Argentino'' was 42 years.  When the audience watched a large male dancer, such as Verulazo,  dance the tango, their reaction was, "I can do that."  They were pulled into the show.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7uvRAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PT254.w.1.0.54|title=Inside Tango Argentino: The Story of the Most Important Tango Show of All Time|last=Gazenbeek|first=Antón|date=2013-12-15|publisher=Enrico Massetti Publishing|year=|isbn=9781304692023|location=|pages=250–255|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate impact of ''Tango Argentino'' was observable wherever it appeared. Shortly after the 1985 Broadway premier, [[Samuel G. Freedman|Samuel G. Friedman]] wrote in the ''New York Times'':&lt;blockquote&gt;From dance schools to fashion shows to the media, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Tango Argentino''&lt;/nowiki&gt; has stirred the metropolitan imagination. ''Vanity Fair'' magazine discoursed on tango history. ''Women's Wear Daily'' devoted a centerfold to tango togs. ''The New Yorker'' published a &lt;nowiki&gt;''Tango Argentino'' cartoon. ''Tango mania,''&lt;/nowiki&gt; quoth ''Vogue''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;We're all tango daft,&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; said Sandra Cameron, who owns a dance school in Greenwich Village.  Courses in Beginning Tango, Advanced Tango and Tango Milonga are now populated by 124 students - three times the pre-&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tango Argentino&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; enrollment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, video footage of Copes and Nieves dancing in ''Tango Argentino'' flows in and out of German Kral’s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-16|title=German Kral|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Kral&amp;oldid=133676945|journal=Wikipédia|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 documentary ''Our Last Tango'' as the two dancers reflect on the passion and turmoil of their relationship and their 50 year partnership in tango.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/14/473803358/our-last-tango-a-dance-movie-with-a-personal-storm-at-its-center|title='Our Last Tango': A Dance Movie With A Personal Storm At Its Center|last=Taylor|first=Ella|date=April 14, 2016|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many see the musical ''Tango Argentino'' as the catalyst for the world-wide revival of Argentine tango in the 1990s, an alternative theory of the cause of this revival can be found in a study by Chris Goertzen and María Susana Azzi titled  "Globalization and the Tango" in the 1999 ''Yearbook for Traditional Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goertzen|first=Chris|last2=Azzi|first2=María Susana|date=1999|title=Globalization and the Tango|journal=Yearbook for Traditional Music|volume=31|pages=67–76|doi=10.2307/767974|jstor=767974}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The authors describe the globalization of tango using an example of the Washington, DC, musical ensemble Quintango:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quintango.com|title=QuinTango Home|website=QUINTANGO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The well-known group Quintango played in Washington, DC, at a [[White House]] gala reception for then Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]], and then two weeks later played in [[Richmond, Indiana]] (population 40,000) at small [[Earlham College]].  The authors observe how a small town, such as Richmond, had an active Argentine tango dance group and how the audience at Quintango's performance was totally familiar with the all forms of tango music.  They attribute this globalization of traditional tango music to mass media and the many tango movies of the 1980s and 1990s. Goertzen and Azzi make no mention of the musical ''Tango Argentino'' in their analysis, rather they refer to a long gradual assimilation of tango into European and North American culture in the early 20th Century. They then describe the growth of tango in the tourist areas of [[San Telmo, Buenos Aires|San Telmo]], Buenos Aires.  The authors present the thesis that this global spread of the culture of Argentine tango reaching as far as small towns in Indiana is the result of the global effects of mass media. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Meeting of Leo I and Attila''''' is a [[fresco]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] and his assistant [[Giulio Romano]]. It was painted in 1514 as part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms that are now known as the ''[[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]'', in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. It is located in the ''Stanza di Eliodoro'', which is named after ''[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]''.

The painting depicts the meeting between the [[Pope Leo I]] and [[Attila|Attila the Hun]], and includes the images of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] in the sky bearing swords. Initially, Raphael depicted Leo I with the face of [[Pope Julius II]] but after Julius' death, [[Raphael]] changed the painting to resemble the new [[pope]], [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]].

'''Theorica''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Θεωρικά}}''') (also '''Theoric Fund''' and '''Festival Fund''') was in [[ancient Athens]] the name for the fund of monies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments of various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in the shape of largesses from the state.&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kennedy  | first = Charles Rann  | author-link = Charles Rann Kennedy  | contribution = Theorica  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume =   | pages = 1126–1127  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1133.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There were, according to [[Xenophon]], more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''De Rep. Ath.'' iii. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides those open to the whole body of the people, there were many confined to the members of each tribe, [[deme]], and house.  These last were provided for out of the private funds of the community who celebrated them.  At the most important of the public festivals, there were not only [[sacrifice]]s, but [[procession]]s, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic contests, and games, celebrated with great splendor and at a great expense.

Theorika was created or reinstated&lt;ref&gt;Some ancient sources cite [[Pericles]] as the founder of the theorika (Plutarch’s Pericles 9.1 and Plato’s Gorgias 515E); [[Agyrrhius|Agyrrhios]], an Athenian demagogue, is also mentioned as the first to have initiated this public largesse by Aristotle in ''Athenian Constitution'' 41.3.  See also Buchanan, James ''Theorika''.  New York 1962 (p. 29-53).&lt;/ref&gt; around 350 BCE, after the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War (357-5 BCE)]],&lt;ref&gt;Justin (6.9.1) dates the establishment of the theorika sometime at the end or after the battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Athenian statesman [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], an administrator to the theorikon treasury sometime after 354/3 until Cephisophon of Aphidna replaced him in 343/2, and Diophantus.  The Social War had plunged Athens into serious military and financial difficulties, thus creating an incentive to help the Athenian people by means of largesse.  It was established to provide enough money for poorer Athenian citizens to be able to purchase tickets for yearly festivals of public worship and theatrical productions, such as the [[Dionysia]], [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]], [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinia]] and [[Thargelia]]. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals, upon whom the burden of {{lang|grc|λειτουργία}} devolved; but a considerable, and perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public [[treasury]].  The religious embassies to [[Delos]] and other places, and especially those to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], [[Isthmian Games|Isthmian]], and [[Pythian Games]], drew largely upon public funds, though a part of the cost fell upon the wealthier citizens who conducted them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Antiquitates juris publici Graecorum'' p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of money contributed to this treasury varied between “15 [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm talents] or less and not much under 100 talents”.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. ''The Athenian Boule''. Oxford 1972: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an epitome (Dem. 1 hyp. 5) of [[Demosthenes]]’ [[Olynthiacs|''First Olynthiac'']], a scholar named [[Libanius]]&lt;ref&gt;Libanius’ explanation is accepted by some, but the information he provides is often questioned.  Edward M. Harris raises sound arguments for doubt in his book ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens'' (New York 2006):  “The road to historical error is often paved with good intentions.  Certainly no one had better intentions than the scholar Libanius…” (p. 121).&lt;/ref&gt;  explains that in Athens there were no stone seats (only wooden benches) at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]], and also originally no charge for admissions into the festival.  Due to the lack of seating available, fights would break out as everyone rushed to find a bench; the leaders of the community decided to charge an admissions fee of two [[Obolus|obols]] to prevent further violence.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"&gt;Blake, W. E. “New Literary Fragments on Demosthenes” Trans Proc Am Philol Assoc 57 (1926) p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was paid to the [[lessee]] of the theater (called {{lang|grc|Θεατρώνης}}, {{lang|grc|Θεατροπώλης}}, or {{lang|grc|ἀρχιτέκτων}}) who undertook to keep it in good repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of being allowed to receive the profits.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  But because poorer citizens could not afford to pay for admittance, Athens established a fund that covered the costs of their tickets.  Each citizen was allotted one [[drachma]] to cover the ticket cost of two obols (διωβελία) on each day of the three-day Dionysia.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"/&gt;   The payments would differ depending on the fluctuations of the state treasury and how many days the festivals lasted.

This payment continued to be exacted after the stone theater was built. [[Pericles]], to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive the price of admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"/&gt;

In time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides theatrical ones: the sum of two [[Obolus|obols]] being given to each citizen who attended; if the festival lasted two days, four obols; and if three, six obols ; but not beyond that. Hence all theoric largesses received the name of ''diobelia'' ({{lang|grc|διωβελία}}).  The sums thus given varied at different times, and of course depended on the state of the public treasury.  These distributions of money, like those of grain and flour, were called ''dianomai'' ({{lang|grc|διανομαί}}), or ''diadoseis'' ({{lang|grc|διαδόσεις}}).  They were often made at the [[Dionysia]], when the allies were present, and saw the surplus of their tribute distributed from the orchestra.  The appetite of the people for largesses grew by encouragement, stimulated from time to time by designing [[demagogue]]s; and in the time of [[Demosthenes]] they seem not to have been confined to the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Philip.'' iv. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  The German classical scholar [[Philipp August Böckh]] calculated that from 25 to 30 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] were spent upon them annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens'' p. 224, 2d ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Theoric Board ==

In the earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly appointed to manage the Theoric fund.  The money thus appropriated was disbursed by the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]''.  After the anarchy, the largess system having been restored by [[Agyrrhius]], a board of managers was appointed, possibly consisting of ten men, who were called by many names ({{lang|grc|ἀρχὴ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικῷ}}, {{lang|grc|οἱ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικὸν τεταγμέμοι}} or {{lang|grc|κεχειροτονημένοι}}, {{lang|grc|θεωρικὴ ἀρχὴ}} &amp;c.).  They were elected by show of hands at the period of the great [[Dionysia]], one from each tribe,  and served four-year terms.  In the time of Eubulus many other branches of the administration were placed under the control of this board; as the management of the civil expenditure, the office of the ''[[Apodektai]]'', the building of docks, [[arsenal]]s, streets, &amp;c.  This was dictated by an anxiety on the part of the people that no part of the revenue should be improperly diverted from the Theoric fund, which they thought would be prevented by increasing the powers of its managers.  But these extraordinary powers appear not to have been of long continuance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]], ''Against Ctesiphon'' 57, ed. Steph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, ''Hellen. Alt.'' vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 124—127, 1st ed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] explains:

“''All the officials concerned with civilian administration are appointed by lot, apart from the treasurer of the army fund (ταμίας στρατιωτικόν), the men in charge of the festival fund and the curator of the water supply; these are elected, and hold office from one [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]] to the next.''”  (Ath. Const. 43.1)

As public revenue greatly increased in the Athenian state, so too did the Theoric administration; according to Demosthenes there was an increase to as much as 400 talents a year from a previous amount of 130 talents (Phil. iv 37-8).  As a result of this growth the Theoric Board began to extend itself into a powerful position over other public works, activities and boards that were supervised by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|βουλή]] (Council of Five Hundred).  The boule had previously controlled the state revenue and the expenditures, as well as the appropriations of monies to the magistrates, with the help of the different boards: the poletai (Auctions Board) and the apodektai (Board of Receivers).&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford 1991: p. 253; see also Arist. ''Ath. Const.'' 47.2-48.1.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the Theoric administration rose in power and worked together with the boule, it put the administration in a position where “it must have had a fair chance of securing for itself the lion’s share of the appropriations and possibly supplementing this share by a surplus”.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. “The Theoric Fund and the graphe paranomon against Apollodorus” GBS XVII (1976): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;   The powerful position also enabled its board members to acquire confidential knowledge, information once only shared among those in the boule, on the activities of other departments.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. “Athenian Democracy After 403 BC” CJ 75.4 (April–May,1980): p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;   This weakened the monopoly of the boule and, as a result, the Theoric officials were able to gain supreme financial insight and replace the boule as the main resource of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes ''Ath. Boule'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;   Men seeking popularity in Athens recognized this growth of power and influence as a source of great opportunity, and eventually the Theoric Board eclipsed and absorbed all other financial offices.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 282.&lt;/ref&gt;   Utilizing this power, the Theoric Board proceeded to oversee the leasing of mines, the financing of expensive public works, such as roads and buildings, and money for the Athenian navy. [[Aeschines]] scornfully describes this new monopoly of power in his speech ''Against [[Ctesiphon (orator)|Ctesiphon]]'':

“''…they [the Theoric Board] also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.''” (3.25)

== Demosthenes, Philip II, and the Stratiotika ==

Before the theorika was established, the stratiotika (τὰ στρατιωτικά), or Military (Stratiotic) Fund, received any remaining surplus revenue if Athens was at war; this provided financing for military expenditures.  But immediately after the Social War, all surplus revenue was allotted to the theorika until Demosthenes fought to have it redirected back to the stratiotika in 339/8.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes was a strong proponent in the fight against the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and believed that all surplus monies should be used for military campaigns rather than for domestic public works; Eubulus, on the other hand, was very much against expensive foreign expeditions.  After the Social War Eubulus and his followers, the “peace party”, believed that the Athenian αρχή was no more, so they used the theorika to “restrain the [[Deme|demos]] from rash imperialistic adventures”&lt;ref&gt;Mader, Gottfried “Pax Duello Mixta: Demosthenes and the Rhetoric of War and Peace” CJ 101.1 (2005-6): p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to convince the people that peace was beneficial.  The theorika had become, in a sense, a psychological tool for this political party to repress the war mentality by exploiting the selfishness of the Athenians.  It was also a “crucial factor in the process of shaping and distorting perceptions”,&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; which might explain the denial of Philip as an immediate threat, and also why the Athenians were more thorough in their organizations of festivals than with their own military (Dem. Phil. i 35-6).  In the ''First Olynthiac'', delivered in 349 BCE, Demosthenes complains that Athens has the means to fight Philip but would rather use its money for pleasure:

“''Such are my views on the expeditionary force.  With regard to the supply of money, you have money, men of Athens; you have more than any other nation has for military purposes.  But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure.  Now if you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not, you have--or rather, you have no supply at all.  ‘What!’ someone will cry, ‘do you actually move to use this money for military purposes?’  Of course I do not.  Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service.  Your opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the money for your festivals.  Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or light, as circumstances demand.  Only money we must have, and without money nothing can be done that ought to be done.  There are other proposals before you for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while there is yet time, grapple with the problem.''” (19-20)

Meanwhile a protective law had been passed in Athens illegalizing proposals on the use of the money in the theorika, especially if the suggestions were contradictory to the purpose of the fund (merismos).  Demosthenes’ caution when approaching the topic of the theorika in the ''First Olynthiac'' proves that such a law was in existence.  Also during this time, in the face of either resisting Philip to retrieve their possessions or betraying their allies and losing them, their [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] and the [[Thracian Chersonese]], [[Apollodorus of Acharnae]] proposed in the boule (in which he was a member in 348 BCE) that the Athenian people should decide whether the surplus should be used for the theorika or the stratiotika  (Dem. 59.4 Against [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaera]]).  The vote was unanimous that the money should be used for the stratiotika against Philip, but, because this type of proposition was still illegal, Apollodorus found himself being indicted by Stephanos of Eroiadai, who drew up a [[graphe paranomon]] (γραφή παρανόμων) against him; he was ultimately fined one talent and his decree was made null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Trevett, Jeremy ''Apollodorus the Son of Paison''. Oxford 1992: p. 138-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Following this vote, Eubulus threatened death to anyone who tried to put the interests of the theorika below that of the stratiotika, making the act a capital offense.  After Apollodorus’ indictment and Eubulus’ new law, Demosthenes openly suggested in his ''Third Olynthiac'', a speech delivered in 349 BCE in lieu of Philip’s hostilities against [[Olynthus]], that the state get rid of the theorika because of its hampering effect upon their current crisis.  He also asked to eliminate military exemptions for those who ran the Dionysian festivals in Athens, as it was demoralizing for the men who wished to serve their country:

“''In plain language I mean the laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service regulations.  The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in consequence discourage those willing to serve.  When you have repealed these laws and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will propose what you all know to be salutary measures.  But until you have done this, do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit, only to be ruined by you for his pains.  You will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also make good advice more dangerous for the future.  Yes, men of Athens, and you ought to insist that those who made these laws should also repeal them.''”  (3.10-11)

The idea of demoralization is echoed by Libanius.  Instead of being paid wages&lt;ref&gt;Libanius is incorrect here; hoplites did not receive payment for their military services (Harris 121).&lt;/ref&gt; for serving in the army and enduring the dangers of warfare, Athenian citizens preferred to stay home and attend the religious festivals.  Eubulus posed an argument two years after the ''First Olynthiac'' that the Athenians had to accept peace with Philip (the [[Peace of Philocrates]], which Aeschines supported), otherwise they would have to go to the [[Pireus|Piraeus]], pay a war-tax (eisphora) to finance the fleet and transfer the money from the theorika to the stratiotika (Dem. On the False Embassy 19.291).  Eubulus had laid out the different options for the Athenians: they could accept peace with Philip or, if they chose to continue the war, they would have to support it using their own means of financing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. M. ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens''. Cambridge 2006: p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes’ goal, by criticizing the theorika, was to snap the Athenians out of their denial and mistaken beliefs so that they could recognize the “absurd contradiction between domestic priorities and external exigencies, between the comfortable illusion of peace and the growing crisis in the north.”&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the ''Fourth Philippic''&lt;ref&gt;Some modern scholars consider the Fourth Philippic to be inauthentic—otherwise it was probably delivered right after the Third Philippic in 341 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes’ attitude towards the theorika was changing:

“''Now there is also another matter, the misrepresentation of which by unfair obloquy and in intemperate language is injuring the State, and furthermore is affording a pretext for those who are unwilling to perform any of their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse.  I am really afraid to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; for I think I shall be able, with advantage to the State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the property-owners against the necessitous.  If we could banish from our midst both the obloquy which some heap upon the Theoric Fund, and also the fear that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole body politic.''” (4.35-37)

Demosthenes’ political party, the “war party”, had always “traditionally (especially in the great days of the Empire) been interventionist externally but ‘Athens-first’ internally.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. J. ''Theorika''. New York 1962: p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;   Seeing that the theorika was crucial to preserving social peace in Athens ([[Demades]], in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Mor. 1011b'', referred to it as the “glue of the democracy”), he needed to appeal to both worlds as an impartial arbiter.  In the ''Fourth Philippic'' he speaks on behalf of the poor in Athens, reminding the wealthy, who criticized the theorika at its inception, that when the public revenue did not exceed 130 talents a year they remained dutiful and paid their property taxes.  With the growth of revenue reaching 400 talents a year, the wealthy no longer felt the weight of financial responsibility upon their shoulders and it was of his opinion that the poor should be able to profit from the increase as well (Phil. iv 37-9).

In 339 BCE the situation in Athens became much more alarming than in 348 when Philip had attacked Olynthus and its allies, a matter Athens (excluding Demosthenes) did not consider an immediate threat. In 339 Philip had seized [[Elateia]] in [[Phocis]], which was a closer and more serious danger to Athens.  Demosthenes did not have any trouble persuading the Assembly to allocate all the public funds to the stratiotika and Philochorus, in a fragment preserved by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (ad Ammaeus 1.11), further illustrates Demosthenes’ success:

“''The people, after listening to the letter [a letter of allegations Philip made against the Athenians] and to the exhortations of Demosthenes, who advocated war and framed the necessary resolutions, passed a resolution to demolish the column erected to record the treaty of peace and alliance with Philip, and further to man a fleet and in every other way to prosecute the war energetically.''”

== The Diminishment of the Theorika ==

The fact that Demosthenes did not face charges for breaking Eubulus’ law suggests that he was able to have the law repealed sometime around 339.  In the year 337/6 Demosthenes became the head of the theorika and donated 10,000 drachmas of his own money (Aesch. 3.24) while revenues were being funneled to the stratiotika; but his donations lasted only one year.  Upon the reinstitution of the theorika he attempted, through private gifts and a large festival, to make up for the privileges the Athenians had lost after adopting his financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Blake p. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly after Demosthenes’ promotion the Theoric Board was weakened by the law of Hegemon, which prohibited men from holding offices for more than four years; before this law, Theoric officials could be elected over and over again in successive terms.  Hegemon was a member of the opposition party along with Aeschines and Demades, and it is difficult to determine a political reason behind his law other than it was “an intended slap at Demosthenes”.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 72-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] had also become a rival for the boule’s control over finances and climbed the ladder of power until he assumed jurisdiction over the state’s treasury in 337/6 as the Controller of Finances (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως), which the Theoric Board had previously monopolized.  He governed this seat for twelve consecutive years until 326/5 when his and Demosthenes’ rival, [[Menesaechmus|Menesaichmus]], took over the position.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its diminishment of powers, the Theoric Board existed in some way or another up until Aristotle’s ''Athenian Constitution'' (326-323 BCE).  Lycurgus was using most of the state’s income to pay for its defense, building projects, and religious festivals, which maintained some sense of the theorika’s continuation in Athens.  One of the last references to the theorika involved Demades’ notorious attempt at bribing the Athenians.  In 331 [[Agis III|King Agis III]] of Sparta persuaded Athens to join him in Sparta’s revolt against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].  The Athenians begged [[Demades]], who was then a member of the Theoric Board, to grant money to be used towards the deployment of [[trireme]]s to aid in the rebellion.  His response, as recorded in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Morals'' (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae 818 E-F), was:

“''You have money, for I have made provision for the Festival of the Pitchers that each of you receive a [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm half-mina]; but if you prefer to use the money for this enterprise, use your own money for the Festival.''”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 80. (His translation)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demades’ bribery successfully kept the Athenians from taking up arms against Alexander.

'''Tyeb Mehta''' (25 July 1925&amp;nbsp;– 2 July 2009) was an Indian painter, sculptor and film maker. He was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] and the first [[post-colonial]] generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist [[Bengal school]] and embraced [[Modernism]] instead, with its [[post-impressionist]] colours, [[cubist]] forms and [[wikt:brusque|brusque]], [[expressionistic]] styles.

Among his most noted later paintings were his [[triptych]] ''[[Celebration (painting)|Celebration]]'', which when sold for Rs 15&amp;nbsp;million ($317,500) at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom;{{cn|date=June 2016}} his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', ''Santiniketan triptych'' series, ''[[Kali (painting)|Kali]]'', ''Mahishasura'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-40764420090702 Artist Tyeb Mehta dies after long illness] [[Reuters]], 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed and worked in [[Mumbai]] for much of his life, except for three spells at London, New York, and [[Santiniketan]], each having a distinct impact upon his work. He received several awards during his career including the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=nin&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-03/india/28178801_1_tyeb-mehta-koodal-rickshaw-puller Tyeb Mehta stood for hope over hype] Nina Martyris, [[Times of India]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Artist-Tyeb-Mehta-passes-away/articleshow/4730972.cms Tyeb Mehta, who weaved metaphor into images passes away] [[The Economic Times]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/tyeb-mehta-was-indias-most-expensive-living-artist-also-its-finest/362810/ Tyeb Mehta was Indias most expensive living artist, also its finest] Kishore Singh, [[Business Standard]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tyeb Mehta was born on 26 July  1925 in [[Kapadvanj]], a town of [[Kheda district]], the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|title=Mehta, Tyeb {{!}} Grove Art|language=en|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in the [[Crawford Market]] neighbourhood of Mumbai, populated by [[Dawoodi Bohras]]. At 22 years, during the [[Partition of India|partition]] riots of 1947 in Mumbai, while staying at Lehri House, Mohammed Ali Road, he witnessed a man being stoned to death by a mob, this he not only expressed in a drawing but it was to have lasting impact on his work, leading to stark and often disturbing depiction of his subjects.&lt;ref name=nin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Svaraj: a journey with Tyeb Mehta's "Shantiniketan triptych"''. by [[Ramchandra Gandhi]]. Vadehra Art Gallery, 2002. {{ISBN|81-87737-02-6}}. ''Page 60''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while initially, he worked as a film editor in a cinema laboratory at Famous Studios, in [[Tardeo]], Mumbai. Later, he received his diploma from [[Sir J.J. School of Art|Sir J. J. School of Art]] in 1952, and was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]], which drew stylistic inspiration from Western [[Modernism]], and included greats of Indian paintings such as [[F.N. Souza]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[M.F. Husain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/I-dont-paint-for-money-Tyeb-Mehta/articleshow/4654123.cms 'I don't paint for money'] [[The Times of India]], 14 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He left for London in 1959, where he worked and lived till 1964. Thereafter, he visited the New York City, when he was awarded a fellowship from the [[Asian Cultural Council|John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-09-20/news-interviews/27324810_1_tyeb-mehta-filmfare-critic-s-award-film-editor Tyeb Mehta: From filmmaker to painter] [[The Times of India]], 20 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; During the years the artist spent in London, Mehta's style was influenced by the expressionist works of Francis Bacon, but while in New York his work came to be characterised by minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Judd.

In December 2005, Mehta's painting ''Gesture'' was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction. That made it the highest price ever paid by an Indian for a work of Indian contemporary art at auction in India at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
