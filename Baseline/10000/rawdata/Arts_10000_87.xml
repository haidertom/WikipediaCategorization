'''''1000 Meisterwerke (1000 Masterpieces)''''' was a [[Germany|German]] art series. It followed the highly successful German ''[[100 Great Paintings|100 Meisterwerke]]''. From 1981 through 1994, the German broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] produced the series (originally aired from 1980 and named ''100 Meisterwerke aus den gro√üen Museen der Welt''; "100 Masterworks from the Great Museums of the World"), which was broadcast by [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]]. In each of the 10-minute broadcasts, a single painting was presented and analyzed by an art historian. The Sunday evening broadcasts had five million viewers.

'''Augustine Phillips''' (died May 1605) was an [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[actor]] who performed in troupes with [[Edward Alleyn]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. He was one of the first generation of English actors to achieve wealth and a degree of social status by means of his trade.

Phillips first enters the historical record as a member of the amalgamation of [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the [[Admiral's Men]] that performed ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'' (perhaps by [[Richard Tarlton]]) between 1590 and 1592. In the surviving "plot" of this performance, Phillips is assigned the role of [[Sardanapalus]]; he is one of the few actors not required to play a double role. He is named in the touring warrant issued to Strange's Men in 1592; after the death of their patron [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]] he joined the new [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], presumably as a sharer.

Phillips remained with the company through its change to the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] and to his death in 1605. Little is known with certainty of his roles with the company, except that he was probably already mature when the company assembled. He appears in the cast lists for [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598), ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), and ''[[Sejanus]]'' (1603). He may be the author of a jig, ''Phillips His Slipper'', entered for publishing in the [[Stationers' Register]] in 1595.

He was one of the six sharers in the [[Globe Theatre]] when it was built in 1598&amp;ndash;9, with a one-eighth share. Over time this made him a comparatively wealthy man, at least as far as Elizabethan actors were concerned. Like Shakespeare, Phillips lived for many years near his occupation in [[Southwark]], in Paris Garden near the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]], and in [[Aldgate]]; but by the time of his death he owned a house in [[Mortlake]], in [[Surrey]].

In 1601, he was the representative of the company called to testify before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about their involvement with the rebellion of the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]; the Chamberlain's Men had been paid by supporters of the Earl to perform Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' before the abortive coup. Phillips' testimony seems to have assuaged whatever anger the court may have felt towards the players; they were not punished, and indeed played for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 24 February 1601, the night before Essex was executed. (The choice of Phillips as representative is interesting; why him, and not Shakespeare or Burbage? He testified that the Lord Chamberlain's Men had played at the request of Essex's supporters, specifically because they were offered 40 shillings more than their normal fee. This might indicate that Phillips had a role in keeping the financial accounts of the company.)

The evidence suggests a life deeply intertwined with the theater. He was a stepbrother of his fellow King's Man [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], and his sister married another actor, [[Robert Gough (actor)|Robert Gough]].

Phillips's daughters Magdalen and Rebecca were baptized in the parish of St. Saviour's in [[Southwark]] in 1594 and 1596 respectively. A son, Augustine or Austen, was baptized there in 1601 but buried three years later. Phillips's will, which was signed on 4 May 1605 and probated on 13 May 1605, mentions two other daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and his wife Anne, plus brothers, sisters, and other relations of a large family. The will includes a number of interesting and revealing bequests:

* a silver bowl worth ¬£5 to each of the executors, [[John Heminges]], [[Richard Burbage]], and [[William Sly]];
* a 30-shilling gold piece each to [[Shakespeare]], [[Henry Condell]], and [[Christopher Beeston]] (Beeston is described as Phillips's "servant;" he was almost certainly a former apprentice);
* 20 shillings in gold each to [[Lawrence Fletcher]], [[Robert Armin]], [[Alexander Cooke]], [[Richard Cowley]], and [[Nicholas Tooley]];
* 40s. to his apprentice James Sands, along with a [[cittern]], a [[bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and a [[lute]], all pending the "expiration of his term of years in his indenture of apprenticehood;"
* 40s. to his "late apprentice" Samuel Gilburne, plus Phillips's "mouse-colored" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass [[viol]];
* and ¬£5 to be split among the hired men "of the company which I am of."

The musical instruments obviously imply that Phillips was a musician, and as such he was probably involved in the dramatic music used in productions throughout his career.

The '''Banc Ty'ndd√¥l sun-disc''' is a small, decorated, [[gold]] ornament discovered at [[Cwmystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Wales]]. It most likely was part of a funerary garment and is more than 4,000 years old, which makes it the earliest gold artifact found in Wales.  
It was discovered  on October 16, 2002 by a team of [[archaeologist]]s who were investigating the site of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Medieval]] [[lead]] [[smelting]] [[hearth]]s below the [[Bronze Age]] [[copper]] mine on Copa Hill.&lt;ref name=GeraldMorgan&gt;Ceredigion, A Wealth of History&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area around Cwmystwyth, has been mined for lead and copper for more than 4,000 years, almost since the beginning of metalworking in [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name=SimonTimberlake&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091106231812/http://www.celticdesignstudio.co.uk/the-banc-tynddol-sun-disc.html sun-disc ‚Äì one of Wales"s earliest gold objects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site excavation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Banc Ty'ndd√¥l (Penguelan) smelting site.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Banc Ty'ndd√¥l(Penguelan) smelting site.]]  --&gt;
Excavation now has shown that these [[mining]] sites date to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] (first century AD) and [[Early Medieval]] (ninth to twelfth century AD) periods, but one of the most important finds of the excavation was the gold disc about the size of a milk-bottle top, which pre-dated these discoveries by more than 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=SimonTimberlake/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the time of its discovery, it seemed uncertain as to whether the gold object had ever been intentionally deposited; no earlier archaeological features were at that time identified, whilst its shallow find-spot suggested that it had been disturbed and re-deposited some distance downslope from its original burial context. However, the object was at that time identified and reported to HM Coroner for Ceredigion as a Treasure find on 30 October 2002, whilst further study of the find continued, and a follow-up investigation of the find spot was planned. Given concerns over the possibility of further artefacts remaining within the ground by virtue of association with the disc, also potential treasure, re-excavation of the site took place in March 2003, with funding from the National Museums and Galleries of Wales.

Samples of soil containing degraded bone fragments were collected for dating along with charcoal from in and around the grave. Insufficient [[collagen]] survived to provide any sort of reliable date from the bone, whilst the three samples of charcoal recovered from the grave fill proved to be intrusive; one suggesting Mesolithic activity associated with the pre-burial land surface (OxA-12983: 8850&amp;nbsp;¬±&amp;nbsp;40 [8210&amp;ndash;7760 CalBC]), another a Late Roman date for the ground surface covering the edge of the grave (OxA-12955: 1675&amp;nbsp;¬±&amp;nbsp;28 [320&amp;ndash;430 Cal AD]), whilst the third consisted of a single piece of oak charcoal derived from the Early Medieval smelting horizon above (OxA-12956: 1264&amp;nbsp;¬±&amp;nbsp;27 [670&amp;ndash;840 Cal AD]). Whilst not providing us with any clear answer, these results do at least support the possibility of a prehistoric burial.
&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon further investigation it was determined that the absence of identifiable skeletal remains and of only a thin film with insufficient collagen, precluded accurate [[Carbon-14]] (C14) dating.&lt;ref name=C14&gt;Archaeology in Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed description==
The disc is 38.9mm in diameter, with a weight of 2.51g, made of a very pure gold that is composed of between 93% and 94% gold, 6% and 7% [[silver]] and a negligible amount of copper. It is decorated with concentric line and dot circles and pierced by two central holes, apparently for attachment.  The design was determined to belong to the Primary [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker]] Goldwork Tradition.&lt;ref name=Antiquity&gt;[http://www.antiquity.cc/ProjGall/timberlake/index.html Antiquity Vol 78 No 302 December] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520131721/http://www.antiquity.cc/ProjGall/timberlake/index.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the exact source for the metal cannot be established, the composition appears consistent with that for Irish, Scottish, and Welsh [[alluvial]] gold.&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;  The disc most likely was made for a funerary garment and possibly, to symbolize the life-giving power of the sun.  Further investigation of the discovery site revealed skeletal remains that once were covered over by a mound of stones, known as a [[cairn]]. The grave was located within a crescent of boulders and was oriented to look down the valley to the west&amp;mdash;a poignant resting place for the person wearing one of Wales's first metal discs derived from native gold.

Similar artifacts have been found in [[Ireland]], [[Isle of Man|The Isle of Man]], and [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=GeraldMorgan/&gt;
Most known examples of this class of 'sun-disc' have been found in Ireland (21), with smaller numbers from Scotland (6), England (5), and similar examples from France. This is the first example to be found in Wales and thought to be the earliest gold artifact from Wales, probably belonging to the slightly later established [[Beaker culture#Britain|Beaker]] phase (c. 2000 BC).&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;  The Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc most closely resembles an example from Ireland that remains without provenance, having two-four linear circles in repouss√© and two central perforations. A similar style with repouss√© dots is to be found in an example from [[Andreas (parish)|Kirk Andreas]] in The Isle of Man.

In Brittany, gold discs with similar dot and linear decoration have been discovered in [[Neolithic]] tombs and they also appear to be associated with early Beaker ([[Chalcolithic]]) abandonment deposits. In Britain, three examples have been found associated with two Beaker burials (one as a pair, and one as a single find) at [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]] and [[Monkton Farleigh|Farleigh Wick]] in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;

The similarities in style and decorative technique between the Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc and 'basket earrings' or gold hair tress ornaments associated with rich Beaker burials is striking. Examples from Kirkhaugh, [[Northumberland]] had been tooled similarly on the surface as a means of enhancing the repouss√© lines applied to the back, a detail precisely matched on the Banc Ty'ndd√¥l disc. The Kirkhaugh basket earring and other items from similar burial sites can all be dated to the period between 2500&amp;ndash;1900 BC.&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;

==Current status==
The disc was declared a treasure in December 2003 and has since been acquired by the [[National Museum Wales|Amgueddfa Cymru ‚Äì National Museum Wales]].

'''Bergen National Opera''' ({{lang-no|Bergen Nasjonale Opera|links=no}}) in [[Bergen]], Norway, originally called ''Den Nye Opera'' (the new opera)&lt;ref&gt;Eva Grimstad, [http://www.bt.no/meninger/debatt/Operabyen-Bergen-2959355.html "Operabyen Bergen"], Meninger, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', 3 September 2013 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a foundation established in 2005 by the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Den Nationale Scene]], [[Grieg Hall|Grieghallen]] and the [[Bergen International Festival]]. In 2007 [[Opera Vest]] became a part of the foundation, which aims to be the regional [[opera company]] for [[Western Norway]].

In addition to professional opera, Bergen National Opera also runs a participatory program for children and teenagers.

The foundation is supported by the [[Ministry of Culture (Norway)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Arts Council Norway]], the [[Hordaland]] community, the city of Bergen, and several other funds, associations and private supporters.

'''''Cliff Rock - Appledore''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Childe Hassam]], painted in 1903. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
Inspired by the [[France|French]] [[impressionism|impressionists]] of the time, Childe painted vibrant, colorful lines filled with action and movement. The varying brushstrokes and loose handling of the medium, Childe shows his confident free handling. Blue ocean reflects onto the large, sun-bleached rock, while Childe‚Äôs open strokes leads the viewer‚Äôs eye back into the painting, off into the distance to the shores beyond, which are barely hinted at with lines of cream and green. Through the broken brushstrokes, Childe‚Äôs desire for realism shines through with his use of shadows and broken reflection of the water.&lt;ref name= "Cliff"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cliff Rock - Appledore gallery label|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/cliff-rock-appledore-hassam-childe|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Hassam, like many American painters at the turn of the century, studied in [[Paris, France]] for three years. He adopted the impressionist style as his own, and worked closely with other [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Mary Cassatt]]. Childe is often hailed as a pure example of the American Impressionist movement.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

A native New Endlander, Childe heavily favored the [[New England]] area for his work, and spent his time painting much of the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]]. This shore is the shore of Appledore, one of the nine islands that make up the [[Isles of Shoals]], located off the coasts of [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Appledore was the location of a small [[artist colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fredrick Childe Hassam Biography|url=http://www.frederickhassam.org/biography.html|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Cliff Rock - Appledore'' was purchased at its inaugural exhibition in 1906 by the John Herron Art Fund.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

{{For|the book by James McBride|The Color of Water}}
[[File:Strawberry splash.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a glass of transparent water sitting on a wooden table|When water is in small quantities (e.g. in a glass) it appears [[wikt:colorless|colorless]] to the [[human eye]]]]
The '''color of water''' varies with the ambient conditions in which that water is present. While relatively small quantities of [[water]] appear to be [[Transparency and translucency|colorless]], pure water has a slight [[blue]] [[color]] that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of white light. Dissolved [[chemical elements|elements]] or suspended impurities may give water a different color.

==Intrinsic colour==
[[File:SwimmingPoolAndBucket.jpg|thumb|right|An indoor swimming pool appears blue from above. as light reflecting from the bottom of the pool travels through enough water that its red component is absorbed. The same water in a smaller bucket looks only slightly blue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=Jim |last2=Milligan |first2=Mark |year=2011 |title=Why is Bear Lake So Blue? |series=Public Information Series |volume=96 |publisher=[[Utah Geological Survey]] |url=http://geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123163847/http://www.geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |isbn=978-1-55791-842-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the water at close range makes it appear colourless to the human eye.]]
The intrinsic colour of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window. The light [[Turquoise (colour)|turquoise]] blue colour is caused by weak [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] in the red part of the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{Citation |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |last2=Smirnov |first2=Sergei N. |year=1993 |title=Why is water blue? |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=612‚Äì614 |url=http://inside.mines.edu/fs_home/dwu/classes/CH353/study/Why%20is%20Water%20Blue.pdf |doi=10.1021/ed070p612|bibcode = 1993JChEd..70..612B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |author2=Fry |title=Absorption spectrum (380-700nm) of pure water.

Absorptions in the visible spectrum are usually attributed to excitations of [[Electron configuration|electronic]] energy states in matter. Water is a simple three-atom [[molecule]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and all its electronic absorptions occur in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and are therefore not responsible for the colour of water in the visible region of the spectrum. The water molecule has three fundamental modes of [[molecular vibrations|vibration]]. Two stretching vibrations of the O-H [[Chemical bond|bond]]s in the gaseous state of water occur at v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3755&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;. Absorption due to these vibrations occurs in the [[infrared]] region of the spectrum. The absorption in the visible spectrum is due mainly to the [[harmonic]] v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 14,318&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent to a wavelength of 698&amp;nbsp;nm. In liquid state at 20¬∞C these vibrations are red-shifted due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in red absorption at 740&amp;nbsp;nm, other harmonics such as v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; giving red absorption at 660&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The absorption curve for heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is of a similar shape, but is shifted further towards the infrared end of the spectrum, because the vibrational transitions have a lower energy. For this reason, heavy water does not absorb red light and thus large bodies of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would lack the characteristic blue colour of the more commonly-found light water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name="Webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |title=Colours from Vibration |author=WebExhibits |work=Causes of Colour |publisher=[[WebExhibits]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212434/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |archivedate=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-10-21 |quote=Heavy water is colourless because all of its corresponding vibrational transitions are shifted to lower energy (higher wavelength) by the increase in isotope mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption intensity decreases markedly with each successive overtone, resulting in very weak absorption for the third overtone. For this reason, the pipe needs to have a length of a meter or more and the water must be purified by [[microfiltration]] to remove any particles that could produce [[Mie scattering]].

Lakes and oceans appear blue for several reasons.  One is that the surface of the water reflects the color of the sky. While this reflection contributes to the observed color, it is not the sole reason.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=612|ps=:"...any simple answer is bound to mislead.  It turns out that contributions to the observed color are made both by reflected skylight and by the intrinsic absorption."}}

Some of the light hitting the surface of ocean is reflected but most of it penetrates the water surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in three different modes when irradiated by light. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so the remaining light seen is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. This is the main reason the [[ocean color|ocean's color]] is blue.

Some constituents of sea water can influence the shade of blue of the ocean. This is why it can look greener or bluer in different areas. Water in swimming pools (which may also contain various chemicals) with white-painted sides and bottom will appear as a turquoise blue.

Clean water appears blue in white-tiled swimming pools as well as in indoor pools where there is no blue sky to be reflected. The deeper the pool, the bluer the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last=Rossing |first=Thomas D. |last2=Chiaverina |first2=Christopher J. |date=1999 |title=Light science: physics and the visual arts |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-0-387-98827-6 |pages=6‚Äì7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Scattering from suspended particles also plays an important role in the color of lakes and oceans.  A few tens of meters of water will absorb all light, so without scattering, all bodies of water would appear black. Because most lakes and oceans contain suspended living matter and mineral particles, known as [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), light from above is reflected upwards. Scattering from suspended particles would normally give a white color, as with snow, but because the light first passes through many meters of blue-colored liquid, the scattered light appears blue. In extremely pure water‚Äîas is found in mountain lakes, where scattering from white-colored particles is missing‚Äîthe scattering from water molecules themselves also contributes a blue color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[File:Ocean color 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The hue of the reflected sky also contributes to the perceived color of water.]]
Another phenomenon that occurs is [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[atmosphere]] along one's line of sight: the [[horizon]] is typically 4‚Äì5&amp;nbsp;km distant and the air (being just above [[sea level]] in the case of the ocean) is at its [[Density of air|densest]].  This mechanism would add a blue tinge to any distant object (not just the sea) because blue light would be scattered into one's line of sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The surfaces of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight, making them appear bluer. The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=613 |ps=:"...the relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle." }}

==Color of glaciers==
{{Main article|Blue ice (glacial)}}

[[Glacier]]s are large bodies of [[ice]] and [[snow]] formed in [[Ice age|cold climates]] by processes involving the compaction of fallen snow. While snowy glaciers appear white from a distance, up close and when shielded from direct ambient light, glaciers usually appear a deep blue due to the long path lengths of the internal reflected light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Relatively small amounts of regular ice appear white because plenty of air bubbles are present, and also because small quantities of water appear to be colorless.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In glaciers, on the other hand, the pressure causes the air bubbles, trapped in the accumulated snow, to be squeezed out increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear blue, therefore a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, would also appear blue.

==Color of water samples==
[[File:Havasu Falls 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|High concentrations of dissolved [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] give the water of [[Havasu Falls]] a turquoise color.]]
Dissolved and particulate material in water can cause discoloration. Slight discoloration is measured in Hazen units (HU).&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization, ISO 2211:1973, ''Measurement of colour in Hazen units (platinum-cobalt scale) of Liquid Chemical Products''&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities can be deeply colored as well, for instance dissolved [[organic compound]]s called [[tannin-stained waters|tannin]]s can result in dark brown colors, or [[algae]] floating in the water (particles) can impart a green color.

The color of a water sample can be reported as:
* ''Apparent color'' is the color of the whole water sample, and consists of color from both [[Solution|dissolved]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] components.
* ''True color'' is measured after filtering the water sample to remove all suspended material.

Testing for color can be a quick and easy test which often reflects the amount of organic material in the water, although certain inorganic components like iron or manganese can also impart color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Water color can reveal physical, chemical and bacteriological conditions. In drinking water, green can indicate copper leaching from copper plumbing and can also represent algae growth. Blue can also indicate copper, or might be caused by syphoning of industrial cleaners in the tank of commodes, commonly known as backflowing. Reds can be signs of rust from iron pipes or airborne bacteria from lakes, etc. Black water can indicate growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria inside a hot water tank set to too low a temperature. This usually has a strong sulfur or rotten egg (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) odor and is easily corrected by draining the water heater and increasing the temperature to {{convert|49|C|F}} or higher.  The odor will always be in the hot water pipes if sulfate reducing bacteria are the cause and never in the cold water plumbing.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The color spectrum with water indicators{{clarify|date=July 2012}} is wide and, if learned, can make identifying and solving cosmetic, bacteriological and chemical problems easier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Water quality and color==
[[File:Lake Pukaki and neighbours - STS088-721-15.jpg|thumb|left|Glacial [[rock flour]] makes New Zealand's [[Lake Pukaki]] a lighter turquoise than its neighbors.]]
The presence of color in water does not necessarily indicate that the water is not [[drinking water|drinkable]]. Color-causing substances such as [[tannin-stained waters|tannins]] may be harmless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Color is not removed by typical [[water filter]]s; however, [[slow sand filter]]s can remove color, and the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] may also succeed in trapping the color-causing compounds within the resulting [[precipitate]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Other factors can affect the color seen:
*Particles and solutes can absorb light, as in tea or coffee. Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color. The Red Sea has occasional blooms of red ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' algae.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*Particles in water can scatter light.  The Colorado River is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water. Some mountain lakes and streams with finely ground rock, such as [[rock flour|glacial flour]], are turquoise.  Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water's absorption can return to the surface and be observed.  Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green, a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Color names==
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|Red tide off the California coast]]
Various cultures divide the [[semantic field]] of colors differently from the English language usage and some do not [[blue-green across cultures|distinguish between blue and green]] in the same way. An example is Welsh where ''glas'' can mean blue or green.

Other color names assigned to bodies of water are [[sea green]] and [[ultramarine]] blue. Unusual oceanic colorings have given rise to the terms [[red tide]] and [[oil spill|black tide]].

The Ancient Greek poet [[Homer]] uses the [[epithet]] "wine-dark sea"; in addition, he also describes the sea as "grey". [[Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age|William Ewart Gladstone]] has suggested that this is due to the [[Ancient Greek]]s classifying colors primarily by luminosity rather than hue, while others believe Homer was color-blind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}{{Portal|Water}}

The '''Convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe''' is a legally binding instrument which set the framework for an accurate [[Architectural conservation|conservation]] approach within Europe. For a total of forty three member states of the [[Council of Europe]], the Conventions total ratification/accession has reached forty-two countries since it was opened for signature in 1985.  It entered into force on 1 December 1987.

After 30 years of collaboration among member states of the Council of Europe, this convention constitutes an important framework for the safeguarding of the [[Cultural Heritage]] of monuments and sites. 
The Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage in Europe, along with the Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society, [[Faro Convention|Faro]] and European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritages, comprise the thrust of cultural heritage protection and development in Europe.

==Issues under the convention==
The issues addressed in this convention are defined by the following objectives: 

* Support the idea of solidarity and cooperation among European Parties, in relation to heritage conservation
* It includes principles of "conservation policies" within the framework of European cooperation
* Strengthen and promote policies for the conservation and development of cultural heritage in Europe

==About the convention==
The starting point of this convention, mentioned in the preamble, was the European Cultural Convention signed in 1954. After that, the first action toward the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage promoted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe started in 1963 through the creation of [[Europa Nostra]], which promoted the intergovernmental cooperation within Europe.

==Structure==

===Preamble===
The overall aim is first give a cultural references improving their environment in the European context, and secondly fostering a sustainable development considering economic enhancement and social development.
Is stated that European parties, by the accordance of common principles, can commit themselves in a permanent collaboration for conservation policies. This can be seen by the accordance of minimum safeguard agreements regarding architectural heritage.
It is mentioned that in matters of cultural heritage and build heritage, the Council of Europe has been working over 30 years. It expresses the purpose and the European philosophy regarding conservation issues.

===Definition of the architectural heritage===
It contains the three definition of heritage define by the 1972 Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage [[UNESCO]]. This comprises the description of monuments, groups of building and sites.

===Identification of properties to be protected===
This section is composed by '''Article 2''', which establishes the realisation of a survey by the creation of an inventory. This will permit not only the documentation of heritage, define in article 1, but also the assessment of properties as the initial action towards legal protection.

===Statutory protection procedures===
This part is defined by '''Article 3, 4 and 5'''.  It contains the legal, political and administrative measures to be taken by each Party for protecting the properties in question. This measures will be applied differ in each region or State. It also describes in article 4, the legal actions applicable to the protected heritage, that ensure the supervision on work which is affecting protected properties.

===Ancillary measures===
Composed by '''Articles 6, 7 and 8'''. Here explain the types of financial support that public authorities may give to guarantee, facilitate and encourage the maintenance and restoration of protected properties. Also, is mentioned the different measures to consider in respect of the environment, like public spaces and pollution control.

===Sanctions===
It contains only '''Article 9''', and which explains that Parties may ensure, that infringements of the law protecting the heritage, will have an adequate response by criminal law or administrative law.

===Conservation policies===
It consists in '''Article 10, 11, 12 and 13'''. It describes principles of integrated conservation of the heritage, reflected in the previous work made by the Council of Europe. Also explain the principle for maintenance though the heritage use, describe in previously in Article 5 of the [[Venice Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;Venice Charter http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/index.html ICOMOS&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICOMOS]]. It also states that there must be balance between the using and conservation, which will conserve the architectural and historical value of the property. This will be aimed by the principles of integrated conservation explained in article 13, which implies and effective cooperation between the administrative departments concerned.

===Participation and associations===
It contains '''Article 14''', and describes the establishment of structures to facilitate cooperation between the parties or regions concerned.

===Information and training===
Contains '''Article 15 and 16''', and explain the importance of public participation in early stage, as a whole to appreciate and understand heritage. This might concerns training systems and trades implicated in [[Architectural conservation|conservation]].

===European co-ordination of conservation policies===
Define by the '''Articles 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21'''. It can be found in Articles 17 and 18 the description of the coordination of European conservation policies. It describes also the technical assistance system under [[Council of Europe]]. Article 19 expresses the desirable exchanges and trade of persons involved in the conservation of the heritage. In Article 20, in order to ensure the successful application of this Convention, is desirable the creation of a committee for monitoring.

===Final clauses===
This section consist in '''Articles 22, 23, 24,25, 26 and 27''', and which has the Europe Council's final clauses for conventions and agreements.

In general, the term '''credit''' in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgement of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense.

==Credit in the arts==
In the creative [[arts]], credits are an acknowledgement of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In [[film]], [[video]], [[television]], [[theater]], etc., ''credits'' means the list of [[actor]]s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.
{{seealso|Motion picture credits}}
===Non-fiction===
In [[non-fiction]] writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of [[plagiarism]], and "piracy" of [[intellectual rights]] such as the right to receive a [[copyright|royalty]] for having written.  In this sense the financial and [[individual capital|individual]] meanings are linked.

Academic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or [[scientific citation|citations]].  Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available.  All of this is thought to improve [[integrity]] of the [[instructional capital]] conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.

===In fiction===
In [[fiction]] writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a [[pen name]]. A [[ghostwriter]] gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.

==In computing==
In [[computer software]] [[software license|licenses]], attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the [[BSD license]] controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.

[[Software documentation]] is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) used by [[Wikipedia]] requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved.

"'''Cross Road Blues'''" (also known as "'''Crossroads'''") is a [[blues]] song written and recorded by American blues artist [[Robert Johnson]] in 1936.  Johnson performed it as a solo piece with his vocal and acoustic slide guitar in the [[Delta blues]]-style. The song has become part of the Robert Johnson mythology as referring to the place where he supposedly sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical talents, although the lyrics do not contain any specific references.

Bluesman [[Elmore James]] revived the song with recordings in 1954 and 1960‚Äì1961.  English guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] popularized the song as "Crossroads" in the late 1960s.  Their [[blues rock]] interpretation inspired many cover versions and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of the "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".  ''Rolling Stone'' placed it at number three on the magazine's list of the "Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" in recognition of Clapton's guitar work.

==Recording==
Little is known about Johnson's life and musical career,{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=106}} although his recordings are well documented.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46‚Äì47}}  In October 1936, Johnson auditioned for music store owner and sometime talent scout [[H. C. Speir]] in Jackson, Mississippi; Speir passed on Johnson's contact information to Ernie Oertle, who was a representative for [[American Record Corporation|ARC Records]].{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=56}}  After a second audition, Oertle arranged for Johnson to travel to San Antonio, Texas, for a recording session.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=15}}  Johnson recorded 22 songs for ARC over three days from November 23 to 27, 1936.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46‚Äì47}}  During the first session, he recorded his most commercially appealing songs.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=131}}  They mostly represented his original pieces and reflected current, piano-influenced musical trends.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=57}}{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=21}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}}  The songs include "[[Terraplane Blues]]" (his first single and most popular record){{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=15}} along with "[[Sweet Home Chicago]]" and "[[I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]", which became [[blues standards]] after others recorded them.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=125}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=188}}

A second and third recording date took place in San Antonio after a two-day break.{{efn|The two-day break in the San Antonio recording sessions may not have been voluntary; one account puts Johnson in jail after a run in with local police.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=74}}}}  Johnson reached back into his long-standing repertoire for songs to record.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}} The material reflects the styles of country blues performers [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]], who influenced Johnson in his youth.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}}{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=58}}  The songs are among Johnson's most heartfelt and forceful,{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=21}} and music historian [[Ted Gioia]] sees a shift in the lyrical themes:
{{quote|At the close of the San Antonio session, the darker, more apocalyptic side of Johnson's work emerges&amp;nbsp;...

"Cross Road Blues" was recorded during Johnson's third session in San Antonio, on Friday November 27, 1936.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}}  The sessions continued at an improvised studio in Room 414 at the [[Gunter Hotel]].  ARC producers [[Art Satherley]] and [[Don Law]] supervised the recording and used a portable disc cutting machine.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=120}}  It is unknown what input, if any, they had into Johnson's selection of material to record or how to present it.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=73}}  Two similar takes of the song were recorded.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60‚Äì61}}

==Lyrics and interpretation==
 [[File:Crossroads marker.jpg|thumb|right|Tourism marker at intersection of historical Highways 61 and 49 in Clarksdale, Mississippi (one of several purported crossroads sites)]]
A crossroads or an [[intersection (road)|intersection]] of rural roads is one of the few landmarks in the [[Mississippi Delta]], a flat featureless plain between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=126}}{{efn|In Johnson's time, "cross road" was the preferred usage for "crossroads".}} It is part of the local iconography and various businesses use the name, such as gas stations, banks, and retail shops.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=127}}  A crossroads is also where cars are more likely to slow down or stop, thus presenting the best opportunity for a hitchiker.{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=274‚Äì275}}  In the simplest reading,  Johnson describes his grief at being unable to catch a ride at an intersection before the sun sets.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}  However, many see different levels of meaning and some have attached a supernatural significance to the song.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}

Both versions of the song open with the protagonist kneeling at a crossroads to ask God's mercy, while the second sections tells of his failed attempts to hitch a ride.{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|pp=37‚Äì38}}  In the third and fourth sections, he expresses apprehension at being stranded as darkness approaches and asks that his friend [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]] be advised that "I'm sinkin' down".{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=38}} The first take of the song, which was used for the single, includes a fifth verse that is not included in the second take. In it he laments not having a "sweet woman" in his distress.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=77}}

The song has been used to perpetuate the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}  The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a [[Faustian bargain]], but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent).{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|pp=37‚Äì38}}  Music historian [[Elijah Wald]] believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=274}}  Delta bluesman [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]] promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern [[folklore]] identifies a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=274}}  However, musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] points out that Johnson was "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery."{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=127}}  His song "[[Hellhound on My Trail]]" tells of trying to stay ahead of the [[Hellhound|demon hound]] which is pursuing him and in "[[Me and the Devil Blues]]" he sings, "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'".{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=37}}{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=38, 41}}  These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".{{sfn|Gioia|2008|p=164}}

Blues historian [[Samuel Charters]] sees the song as having elements of protest and social commentary.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76‚Äì77}}  The second verse includes "the sun goin' down now boy, dark gon' catch me here", a reference to the "sundown laws" or [[curfew]] during [[racial segregation in the United States]].{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76‚Äì77}}  Signs in the rural South advised "Nigger, don't let the sun set on you here".{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76‚Äì77}}  Johnson may be expressing a real fear of trumped up vagrancy charges or even [[lynching]]s that still took place.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=125}}  Others suggest that the song is about a deeper and more personal loneliness.{{sfn|Charlton|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=38}}  Writers Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch argue that the fifth verse in the single version captures the essence of the song: "left alone, abandoned, or mistreated, he stands at the crossroad, looking this way or that for his woman".{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=77}}

"Cross Road Blues" reflects Johnson's Delta blues roots and may have been in his repertoire since 1932.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=75‚Äì76}} It is the first recording to show his mastery of his mentor Son House's style, particularly in his [[Slide (guitar technique)|slide guitar work]].{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=155, 158}}{{efn|Johnson recorded two popular Son House songs, "[[Walkin' Blues]]" and "Preaching Blues", at the same session after "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=63}}}}  Music historian Edward Komara identifies parts of "Straight Alky Blues" by [[Leroy Carr]] and [[Scrapper Blackwell]] (1929) along with [[Roosevelt Sykes]]' subsequent adaptation as "Black River Blues" (1930) as melodic precedents.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=59}}  However, Johnson infuses their relaxed urban approach with a more forceful rural one.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60, 62}}  Komara terms Johnson's guitar playing a "blues harp style".{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=54}}  It contrasts with Johnson's finger-picking "piano style", which uses a boogie-style accompaniment on the bass strings while playing melody and harmonies on the higher strings.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=44‚Äì45}}  Harp-style playing employs sharp percussive accents on the bass strings (an imitation of the sharp draw used by harmonica players) and allows Johnson to explore different chordings and fills.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=54, 62}}{{efn|According to Son House, Johnson began playing harmonica when he was 15 or 16 years old and "could blow harmonica pretty good.  Everybody liked it."{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=109}}}}  Johnson uses this technique for "Terraplane Blues", which shares many common elements with "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=155}}

The song's structure differs from a well-defined [[twelve-bar blues]]. The verses are not consistent and range from fourteen to fifteen bars in length.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71‚Äì72}}  Additionally, the harmonic progression is often implied rather than stated (full IV and V chords are not used).{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71‚Äì72}}  Johnson uses a Spanish or [[open G tuning]] with the guitar tuned up to the [[key of B]].{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=59}}  This facilitates Johnson's use of a slide, which features as prominently in the song as the vocal.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=62}} The slide parts function more as a second "answer" vocal than accompaniment, with the tension underscoring the dark turmoil of the lyrics.{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=155‚Äì156}} Charters characterizes the song's rhythm as ambiguous, imparting both a [[4/4 time|4/4]] and 8/8 feel.{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Music writer Dave Headlam elaborates on Johnson's rhythm:
{{quote|Meter itself is a compositional and performance device which comes in and out of focus in response to the fluid rthyms and changing accents in the lower beats.  The irregular groupings extend to smaller beat divisions, with an interplay between triplet 'swing' and duple divisions of the beat&amp;nbsp;... Johnson's irregular rhythms and variation in support of the metric beat suggest a more personal, idiosyncratic vision.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}}}
The two takes of the song are performed at moderate, but somewhat different tempos.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60‚Äì61}}  Both begin slower and speed up; the first is about 106 [[beats per minute]] (bpm), while the second is about 96 bpm.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60‚Äì61}}  Johnson prepares to go into the fifth section for the slower second take, but the engineer apparently cut him off because of the [[Gramophone record#78 rpm recording time|time limits of ten-inch 78&amp;nbsp;rpm record]]s.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=156}}  In addition to the slower tempo, Johnson sings the verses at a lower pitch, although both takes are in the same key.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=61}}  This allows for greater variation and nuance in the vocal.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=61}}  Together with refinements to some guitar parts, the differences serve to help further distinguish the second take from "Terraplane Blues" and give it more of its own character.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=62}}

==Releases==
ARC and [[Vocalion Records]] issued the first take of "Cross Road Blues" in May 1937 on the then standard 78&amp;nbsp;rpm record.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}}  The single, with its flip side "[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]", sold poorly.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=128}} The song remained out of print after its initial release until ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|The Complete Recordings]]'' box set in 1990.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}} The second take was released in 1961, when producer [[Frank Driggs]] substituted it for the original on Johnson's first [[LP album|long-playing record album]] compilation ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Neal"/&gt; This take was also included on the 1990 ''Complete Recordings'' (at 2:29, it is 10 seconds shorter than the original 2:39 single version).{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46, back cover}}

==Elmore James versions==
American blues singer and guitarist [[Elmore James]], who popularized Robert Johnson's "[[Dust My Broom]]", recorded two variations on "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Both titled "Standing at the Crossroads", they feature James' trademark "Dust My Broom" amplified slide-guitar figure and a backing ensemble.  James' lyrics focus on the lost-love aspect of the song:{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}
{{poemquote|Well I was standin' at the crossroad, and my baby not around (2√ó)
Well I begin to wonder, 'Is poor Elmore sinkin' down'}}
James first recorded the song in August 1954 at [[Modern Records]]' new studio in Culver City, California.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  [[Maxwell Davis]] supervised the session and a group of professional studio musicians provided the backup.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  The song was produced in a newer style that Modern used successfully for [[B.B. King]] and James' slide guitar was placed further back in the mix.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  [[Flair Records]], another of the [[Bihari brothers]]' Modern labels, released the single, backed with "Sunny Land".{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  The song became a regional hit, but did not reach the national charts.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  Labels associated with Modern included "Standing at the Crossroads" on several James compilation albums, such as ''Blues After Hours'' ([[Crown Records|Crown]]), ''The Blues in My Heart ‚Äì The Rhythm in My Soul'' ([[Custom Records]]), and ''Original Folk Blues'' ([[Kent Records]]).{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=36}}

In 1959, producer [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]] signed James to his [[Fury Records|Fury]]/[[Fire Records|Fire]]/[[Enjoy Records|Enjoy]] group of labels.{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=12}}  In addition to new material, Robinson had James revisit several of his older songs, including "Standing at the Crossroads".{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  James re-recorded it at Beltone Studios in New York City in late 1960 or early 1961 during one of his last sessions.{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  Studio musicians again provided the backup and the horn section included baritone saxophone by [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]].{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  [[Bell Records]]' subsidiary labels released the song after James' death in 1965 ‚Äì Flashback Records released a single with a reissue of "[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]" and Sphere Sound Records included it on a James compilation album also titled ''The Sky Is Crying''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Homesick James]], who recorded and toured with his cousin Elmore,{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2‚Äì3}} also recorded a rendition titled "Crossroads".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Homesick derived his guitar style from Elmore, which music critic Bill Dahl describes as "aggressive, sometimes chaotic slide work".{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2‚Äì3}}  Unlike Elmore, however, he uses most of the lyrics from Johnson's second take, which had been first issued in 1961.{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2‚Äì3}}  The July 23, 1963, recording session produced Homesick's only single for Chicago-based [[USA Records]], "Crossroads" backed with "My Baby's Sweet".{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2‚Äì3}}

==Eric Clapton/Cream interpretation==
{{anchor|Crossroads (Eric Clapton cover)}}
===Background===
In early 1966, while still with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]], [[Eric Clapton]] adapted the song for a recording session with an ''ad hoc'' studio group, dubbed [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]].{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=24}}  [[Elektra Records]] producer [[Joe Boyd]] brought together [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals, Clapton on guitar, [[Jack Bruce]] on bass guitar, [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] on harmonica, Ben Palmer on piano, and [[Pete York]] on drums for the project.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=24}}  Boyd recalled that he and Clapton reviewed potential songs; Clapton wanted to record [[Albert King]]'s "[[Crosscut Saw (song)|Crosscut Saw]]", but Boyd preferred to adapt an older country blues.{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=111}}  Their attention turned to Robert Johnson songs and Boyd proposed "Crossroads"{{efn|Boyd refers to Johnson's song as "Standing at the Crossroads".{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=111}}}} and Clapton chose "[[Traveling Riverside Blues]]".{{sfn|Boyd|2010|pp=111‚Äì112}}{{efn|"Traveling Riverside Blues", like the second take of "Cross Road Blues", was first issued in 1961 on Johnson's ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' compilation.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46‚Äì47}}}}

For the recording, Clapton developed an arrangement using lyrics from both songs with an adaption of the guitar line from the latter.{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=112}}{{efn|[[Led Zeppelin]] later used lyrics from "Traveling Riverside Blues" with [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s "[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]" set to a rock arrangement for "[[The Lemon Song]]".&lt;ref&gt;

"Crossroads" became a part of Cream's repertoire when Clapton began performing with Jack Bruce and [[Ginger Baker]] in July 1966. Their version features a prominent guitar [[Riff|riff]] with hard-driving, upbeat instrumental backing and soloing.&lt;ref name="Gilliam"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71‚Äì72}}   Clapton previously recorded "[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]" with Mayall and "[[From Four Until Late]]" with Cream using arrangements that followed Johnson's original songs more closely.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=99}}  However, he envisioned "Crossroads" as a [[rock (music)|rock]] song:
{{quote|It became, then, a question of finding something that had a riff, a form that could be interpreted, simply, in a band format.  In 'Crossroads' there was a very definite riff.  He [Johnson]  was playing it full-chorded with the slide as well.  I just took it on a single string or two strings and embellished it.  Out of all of the songs it was the easiest for me to see as a rock and roll vehicle.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=69}}}}
Clapton simplifies Johnson's guitar line and sets it to a straight [[eighth-note]] or rock rhythm.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=69}}  He and Bruce on bass continuously emphasize the riff throughout the song to give it a strong and regular [[Meter (music)#Meter in song|metric drive]] combined with Baker's drumming.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  Johnson's irregular [[Bar (music)|measures]] are also standardized to typical [[Twelve-bar blues|twelve-bar]] sections in which the I‚ÄìIV‚ÄìV [[Chord progression#Blues changes|blues progression]] is clearly stated.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  Clapton does not adapt Johnson's slide guitar technique or open tuning; instead he follows the electric guitar soloing approach of B.B. King and [[Albert King]].{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  However, he employs a Johnson guitar innovation, the duple shuffle [[Figure (music)|pattern]] or [[boogie]] [[Walking bass|bass line]], while singing (Johnson only used it for two bars in "Cross Road Blues").{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}{{efn|Johnson first recorded an adaptation of the boogie bass line for guitar in "Dust My Broom".{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=136‚Äì137}}  Later, Elmore James used it for the rhythm guitar parts on "Standing at the Crossroads".}}

Clapton also simplifies and standardizes Johnson's vocal lines.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}} Schumacher calls Clapton's vocal on "Crossroads" his best and most assured with Cream.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=99}}  In addition to Johnson's opening and closing lyrics, he twice adds the same section from "Traveling Riverside Blues":{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=91}}
{{poemquote|I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side (2√ó)
You can still barrel house baby, on the riverside}}
During the instrumental break, Cream takes an [[Musical improvisation|improvisational approach]] characteristic of their later live performances.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}  Bruce's bass lines were aggressively driven, yet his lines were independent and unique. His blend rhythm and harmony complimented well with Baker‚Äôs drum fills and more complex techniques typical of drummers in [[jazz trio]]s.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}  However, the momentum is never allowed to dissipate and is constantly reinforced.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}

====Views on editing for album version====
Clapton biographer Schumacher notes "Given the passion of the solo performances on 'Crossroads,' it seems almost miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself."{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=100}}  Several music writers have explained that Cream's recording for ''Wheels of Fire'' was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trio ‚Äì in the notes for Clapton's ''[[Crossroads (Eric Clapton album)|Crossroads]]'' box set, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] credits the trimming to engineer [[Tom Dowd]],{{sfn|DeCurtis|1988|p=9}} while critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] attributes the editing to producer [[Felix Pappalardi]], who "cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes", to allow the song's drive more continuity.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1985 interview, Clapton was asked if the song had been edited.  He replied:
{{quote|I can't remember.  I really haven't heard that in so long‚Äîand I really don't like it, actually.  I think there's something wrong with it. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we weren't lost at that point in the song, because ''that'' used to happen a lot.{{sfn|Forte|2010|p=29}}}}
However, Barry Levenson, who produced Cream's 1997 box set ''[[Those Were the Days (Cream album)|Those Were the Days]]'', asserts: 
{{quote|It's not edited, and I've got an audience tape from the same show which verifies that{{nbsp}}... That was a typical performance of the song.  I've listened to a lot of tapes, and all of the 'Cross Road Blues (Crossroads)' that I've heard come in at four minutes and change.  They never seemed to expand it beyond that.{{sfn|Hal Leonard||loc=eBook}}}}

==Recognition and influence==
In 1986, Robert Johnson's "Cross Road Blues" was inducted into the [[Blues Foundation]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="O'Neal"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8613">There is a large [[body of knowledge]] that [[designer]]s call upon and use during the [[design process]] to match the ever-increasing complexity of design problems.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, H. Du, Knowledge intensive collaborative design modeling and support, part I: Review, distributed models and framework, Computers in Industry 57 (2006) 39‚Äì55&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design knowledge''' can be classified into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;M. Stokes, Managing Engineering Knowledge: MOKA Methodology for Knowledge Based Engineering Applications, MOKA Consortium, London,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; '''product knowledge''' and '''design process knowledge'''.

==Product Knowledge==
'''Product knowledge''' has been fairly studied and a number of modeling techniques have been developed. Most of them are tailored to specific products or specific aspects of the design activities. For example, [[geometric modeling]] is used mainly for supporting detailed design, while [[knowledge modeling]] is working for supporting conceptual designs. Based on these techniques, a design repository project at [[NIST]] attempts to model three fundamental facets of an artifact representation:&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, R.D. Sriram, W. Regli, The role of knowledge in next generation product development systems, ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering 1 (1) (2001) 3‚Äì11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, Architecture and implementation of a design repository system, in: Proceedings of ASME DETC2002, 2002, Paper No. DETC2002/CIE-34463.&lt;/ref&gt; the physical layout of the artifact (form), an indication of the overall effect that the artifact creates (function), and a causal account of the operation of the artifact (behavior). The recent NIST research effort towards the development of the basic foundations of the next generation of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems suggested a core representation for design information called the '''NIST core product model''' (CPM) &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Fenves, A core product model for representing design information, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]&lt;span title="Interagency Report"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; 6736, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of derived models defined as extensions of the CPM (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R.D. Sriram, Feature-based component model for design of embedded system, in: B. Gopalakrishnan (Ed.), Intelligent Systems in Design and Manufacturing, Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 5605, SPIE, Bellingham, WA, vol. V, 2004, pp. 226‚Äì237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sudarsan, Y.H. Han, S.C. Feng, U. Roy, F. Wang, R.D. Sriram, K. Lyons, Object-oriented representation of electro-mechanical assemblies using UML, NISTIR 7057, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;). The NIST core product model has been developed to unify and integrate product or assembly information. The CPM
provides a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; expandable; independent of any one product development process; capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior, material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The [[entity-relationship]] data model influences the model heavily; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] class and association class, respectively.

==Design Process Knowledge==
'''Design process knowledge''' can be described in two levels: design activities and design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R. D. Sriram, et al., Knowledge-intensive collaborative decision support for design process: hybrid decision support model and agent, Computers in Industry 59 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of representation for design rationale has been recognized but it is a more complex issue that extends beyond artifact function. The [[design structure matrix]] (DSM) has been used for modeling design process (activities) and some related research efforts have been conducted. For example, a web-based prototype system for modeling the product development process using a multi-tiered DSM is developed at MIT. However, few research endeavors have been found on design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, SHARED DRIMS: SHARED design recommendation and intent management system, in: Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, IEEE Press,1993, pp. 213‚Äì221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, Conflict mitigation system for collaborative engineering, AI EDAM‚ÄîSpecial Issue of Concurrent Engineering 9 (2) (1995) 101‚Äì123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation Scenarios==
In terms of representation scenarios, '''design knowledge''' can also be categorized into off-line and on-line knowledge. Design process knowledge can be categorized into ontologies.

===Off-line Knowledge===
'''Offline Knowledge''' refers to existing [[knowledge representation]], including design knowledge in handbook and design ‚Äò‚Äò[[know-how]]‚Äô‚Äô, etc.; the latter refers to the new design knowledge created in the course of design activities by designers themselves. For the off-line knowledge, there are two representation approaches. One is to highly abstract and categorize existing knowledge including experiences into a series of design principles, rationales and constraints. [[TRIZ]] is a good instance of this approach. The other is to represent a collection of design knowledge into a certain case for description. '''[[Case-based reasoning|Case-based]] design''' is an example of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;W.H.Wood III, A.M. Agogino, Case based conceptual design information server for concurrent engineering, Computer-Aided Design 8 (5) (1996) 361‚Äì369.&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue is on the computerization of the
design knowledge representation. For instance, researchers at the Engineering Design Centre at Lancaster University, UK established a unique knowledge representation methodology and knowledge base vocabulary based on the theory of domains, design principles and [[computer modeling]]. They developed a software tool for engineering knowledge management. The tool provides an engineering system designer with the capability to search a knowledge base of past solutions, and other known technologies to explored viable alternatives for product design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===On-line Knowledge===
'''On-line knowledge representation''' is capturing the dynamic design knowledge in a certain format for design re-use and archive. A few research efforts have been found in this area. Blessing &lt;ref&gt;L.T.M. Blessing, A process-based approach to computer supported engineering design, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Twente, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes the process-based support system (PROSUS) based on a model of the design process rather than the product. It uses a [[design matrix]] to represent the design process as a structured set of issues and activities. Together with the common product data model (CPDM), PROSUS supports the capture of all outputs of the design activity.

===Ontologies===
[[Ontology (information science)|Ontologies]] are being used for product representation (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;L. Patil, D. Dutta, R.D. Sriram, Ontology-based exchange of product data semantics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering 2 (3) (2005) 213‚Äì225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological product modeling for collaborative design, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Liang, C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological modeling platform, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). Research suggests that there is a need to provide computer support that will supply clear and complete design knowledge and also facilitate designer intervention and customization during the decision-making activities in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Madni, The role of human factors in expert systems design and acceptance, Human Factors 30 (4) (1988) 395‚Äì414.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, WebCADET &lt;ref&gt;P.A. Rodgers, A.P. Huxor, N.H.M. Caldwell, Design support using distributed web-based AI tools, Research in Engineering Design 11 (1999) 31‚Äì44.&lt;/ref&gt; is a design support system that uses distributed Web-based [[AI]] tools. It uses the AI as text approach, where [[knowledge-based systems]] (KBSs) can be seen as a medium to facilitate the communication of design knowledge between designers. The system can provide support for designers when searching for design knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13758">"'''Do not go gentle into that good night'''" is a poem in the form of a [[villanelle#form|villanelle]], and the most famous work of Welsh poet [[Dylan Thomas]] (1914‚Äì1953).&lt;ref name=poets&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dylan-thomas|title=Dylan Thomas|work=Academy of American Poets|quote=He took his family to Italy, and while in Florence, he wrote ''In Country Sleep, And Other Poems'' (Dent, 1952), which includes his most famous poem, ‚ÄúDo not go gentle into that good night.‚Äù}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though first published in the journal ''[[Botteghe Oscure]]'' in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferris |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ferris (author) |title=Dylan Thomas, A Biography |year=1989 |publisher=Paragon House |location=New York |page=283 |isbn=1-55778-215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was written in 1947 when Thomas was in [[Florence]] with his family.

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its ‚Äúcharacters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.‚Äù The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it ‚Äúconcerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.‚Äù 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as ‚Äúof or relating to the household.‚Äù [[Drama]] receives the definition of ‚ÄúA prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,‚Äù and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of ‚Äúa serious story relating to the household,‚Äù clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have ‚Äúgodlike‚Äù attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], ‚Äúsensational incidents, and epic personages‚Äù within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the ‚Äútrend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.‚Äù These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: ‚Äúselective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.‚Äù This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the ‚Äúslice-of-life‚Äù shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows ‚Äúbrought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and ‚Äúsurpassed other such works‚Äù of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as ‚Äúminimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as ‚Äúdistinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the ‚Äúwar-at-home‚Äù style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's ‚ÄúBrilliant Lies‚Äù uses ‚Äúdomestic unit battling‚Äù to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides ‚Äúdramatic irony‚Äù as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This ‚Äú[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.‚Äù
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the ‚Äú[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]‚Äù of ‚Äútraditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.‚Äù The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the ‚Äúrealistic impression‚Äù of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an ‚Äúintimate personal way of communicating.‚Äù

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have ‚Äúgood [socially] position‚Äù characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

'''eBaum's World''' is a humor/entertainment website that is part of the Literally Media family (Cheezburger, Failblog, Memebase, I Can Has Cheezburger, Know Your Meme). The content of the site is mostly collections of funny images, memes, viral videos, and articles on Internet culture and gaming. The majority of the content on the site is submitted by their large user base, and the users are paid through a monetary point system "eBones."

==History of ownership==
eBaum's World is a website that originated in [[Rochester, New York]] featuring entertainment media such as [[video]]s, [[Adobe Flash]] [[cartoon]]s, and [[browser game|web games]]. The site was created and owned by Eric "eBaum" Bauman and his secretary and father, Neil. They sold the site to ZVUE Corporation in August 2008 for $15 million cash and $2.5 million in stock, with further payouts upon performance.&lt;ref name="zvue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.zvue.com/news/20070802.php|title=HandHeld Entertainment to Acquire eBaum‚Äôs World, a Premier Online Entertainment Site|date=2007-08-02|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2009, Bauman reported that ZVUE fired him and the rest of the staff. The Headquarters were moved to San Francisco where they worked out of the ZVUE offices.

eBaum's World is owned and operated by Literally Media, which also owns Cheezburger ([[Failblog]], [[Memebase]], [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]) and [[Know Your Meme]].

==Features==
The site features individual celebrity [[soundboard (flash)|soundboard]]s, where users can click buttons to hear quotes or phrases spoken by that celebrity. By pressing certain buttons in an organized order, users can simulate the celebrities saying unusual things.

There is a [[chatroom]], and a store which sells eBaum merchandise. There is also a section called "Moron Mail" which features feedback sent in by users.

eBaum's World has a very large collection of prank and comedic photos which are divided into signs, Photoshop images, and misleading croppings of normal pictures, etc.

This site also has a large collection of Flash movies and games from across the internet. Some of the more famous ones are [[Peanut Butter Jelly Time]] (despite the creator's explicit statements that he does not want it hosted on eBaum's World&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/ebaum.html |title=Wired 14.10: Dude, That Is So Not Funny |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Badger Badger Badger]].

==Copyright infringement and controversy==
eBaum's World has garnered controversy in different Internet communities over the years due to numerous incidents of content being taken from other sites (such as [[YTMND]], [[Something Awful]], [[Albino Blacksheep]], [[4chan]], [[Olde English (sketch comedy)|Olde English]], [[Weebl's Stuff]], and [[Newgrounds]]) without attribution. Companies such as [[Viacom]]&lt;ref name="courttv.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/news/cow/022603_prankcalls_ctv.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306095852/http://www.courttv.com/news/cow/022603_prankcalls_ctv.html |archivedate=2003-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that the Baumans have infringed on their copyrights as well. Eric Bauman denies critics' claims that the site's content is stolen, citing research done by site editors and the consent form that must accompany uploads of material. He claims to honor all requests to remove unauthorized material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-05.html |title=Funny Videos, Funny Pictures, Flash Games, Jokes |publisher=Ebaumsworld.com |date=2009-12-13 |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831234504/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-05.html |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
*As early as 2003, Eric Bauman had been threatened by legal action by corporations, citing unauthorized use of trademarked names or copyrighted material. One notable case involved the "soundboards" and the audio used within them.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;
*Since November 2005, several arguments between eBaum's World forum members and Something Awful forum members have occurred concerning the posting of "Photoshop Phriday" images on eBaum's World without permission.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
*In January 2006, an animated image titled "[[Lindsay Lohan]] Doesn't Change Facial Expressions" was lifted from YTMND.com and posted at eBaum's World with the latter site's watermark superimposed. The incident touched off a feud between the two sites, resulting in eBaum's World removing the animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.ytmnd.com/EBaum%27s_World |title=EBaum's World - YTMND wiki, explaining the Internets one article at a time |publisher=Wiki.ytmnd.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 26, 2006, several images from the Something Awful forums were displayed on the eBaum's World website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3089 |title=Mixed-up Movies |publisher=Somethingawful.com |date=2005-07-29 |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111185253/http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3089 |archivedate=2006-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}} The images on eBaum's World were cropped to remove the Something Awful watermark. The page was removed later in the day following multiple complaints being expressed on the eBaum's World forums. As a result, Something Awful switched to a more invasive [[Digital watermarking|watermark]] template.
*On June 12, 2006, Steven Lerner of Albino Blacksheep explained that eBaum's World took the popular Flash animation "Animator vs. Animation", and the creator of the Flash animation, [[Alan Becker]], would take legal action against eBaum's World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alanbecker.deviantart.com |title=alanbecker on deviantART |publisher=Alanbecker.deviantart.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albino Blacksheep has also threatened legal action and claims that other websites have also asserted difficulties with Eric Bauman. Lerner and Becker used the MochiBot Flash tracking tool to track who used the animation on their web sites. Lerner also explained that the Flash animation is legally protected under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998. Furthermore, when the flash was posted on eBaum's World, it had been decompiled and the line "Hosted on albinoblacksheep.com" was removed. On June 9, Bauman sent Becker a $250 check as well as entering him into a monthly "contest" (of which Becker was the [[de facto]] winner) in hopes of having any legal charges dropped. Becker was also told to submit a pre-written statement claiming that none of eBaum's World's content was stolen, and that Bauman had contacted him prior to his content being posted on the site. Alan accepted this proposal, and later submitted this letter of apology to the Flash community of Albino Blacksheep:

{{bq|1=Hello, I am the author of Animator vs. Animation...

I feel so ashamed, and the world is ashamed of me.

I fell into eBaum's trap. I gave them fuel to fight back.

With their constant persuasion and offers for money, they made me write a quote saying that everything was fine. Of course everything was fine for me, because I had the money they had given me. What can you expect, I was dead poor before, I have no experience with business. The quote says they contacted me before they posted my animation on their website, however I did not give them permission to put it on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/archive/june2006 |title=June 2006 &amp;#124; Archive |publisher=Albinoblacksheep.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
On June 26, 2006, eBaum's World removed the animation and the apology from Becker from their web site.

*On July 9, 2006, eBaum's World hosted an animation called "Dumb Dinosaur", originally found on Albino Blacksheep and Spinnerdisc.com. They subsequently removed the animation, and issued this apologetic statement to Drew Mokris, creator of Dumb Dinosaur:
{{bq|1=Mr. Mokris,

We were recently contacted by a fan of yours in regards to the July 9th post on your website declaring that you did not give us permission to feature your flash animation. First off, I apologize for the mixup, your flash was submitted to us via our upload form and our clearance dept's initial review led us to believe it was submitted by the original author. I have removed the animation from the system, although it may take a few hours for the changes to be reflected for all users. Once again, my apologies for the mixup, and keep up the good work, we are big fans of your animations!}}

It went on to issue him a draft notice to join Eric's program for Flash animators to put eBaum's World logos in all their animations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==On television==
===Right This Minute===
eBaum's World has had a weekly segment on ABC-Disney's [[Right This Minute]] called "Real or Fake" since July 2012. Each week longtime eBaum's World editor MacDreidel brings three video clips that are viewed, discussed and ultimately voted on by the show's hosts to determine if the video is a real viral video, or a staged fake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rightthisminute.com/videos/real-or-fake] - ''Real or Fake''&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV series attempt===
On January 24, 2006, [[USA Network]] made a deal with the [[Fox Television Studios]] to create a television program based on eBaum's World. Producers described it as a late-night companion special to air with ''[[WWE Raw]]'' featuring clips from the website, as well as new and exclusive content including interviews with former and current eBaum's World subjects. The Show was to feature former [[TechTV]] Host [[Martin Sargent]] of Unscrewed and professional wrestler [[Chris Jericho]]. The show was being executive produced by Simon Andreae through his production company, The Incubator, in association with Fox Television Studios. The [[cease and desist]] letters from this company were removed when this show was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050303004436/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/grapefall-legal.html Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2006, a researcher named Bradley Scott from eBaum's World TV show contacted the webmaster of Albino Blacksheep, asking the webmaster to sign over the site's content while refusing to admit what show it was for{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. The producer of eBaum's World television show finally admitted who he was but did not directly acknowledge the content that appears on eBaum's World, including Albino Blacksheep's. The webmaster recorded samples of these calls for their message boards{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

===Web Soup===
[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s TV show ''[[Web Soup]]'' partnered up with eBaum's World for its popular segment "This Week in FAIL" for its 3rd season run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebaumsworld.com/user/blog/jfetus/view=81431435 WEBSOUP SEASON 3 THIS WEEK IN FAIL] - ''eBaum's WOrld Blog'' (released APril 10, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|right|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Ethics'', in the posthumous Latin first edition]]

'''''Ethics, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order''''' ({{lang-la|Ethica, ordine geometrico demonstrata}}), usually known as the '''''Ethics''''', is a philosophical treatise written in Latin by [[Benedict de Spinoza]]. It was written between 1664 and 1665{{Citation needed|reason=The Baruch Spinoza article states that Ethics was completed in 1676. So who's lying?|date=November 2018}} and was first published posthumously in 1677.

The book is perhaps the most ambitious attempt to apply the [[Euclid's Elements|method of Euclid]] in philosophy. Spinoza puts forward a small number of definitions and axioms from which he attempts to derive hundreds of [[propositions]] and [[corollaries]], such as "When the Mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it",&lt;ref&gt;Part 3, proposition 33.&lt;/ref&gt; "A free man thinks of nothing less than of death",&lt;ref&gt;Part 4, proposition 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The human Mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the Body, but something of it remains which is eternal."&lt;ref&gt;Part 5, proposition 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
===Part I: Of God===
The first part of the book addresses the relationship between God and the [[universe]]. [[Abrahamic religions|Tradition]] held that God exists outside of the universe, created it for a reason, and could have created a different universe if he chose. Spinoza denies each point. According to Spinoza, God ''is'' the natural world. As with many of Spinoza's claims, what this means is a matter of dispute. Spinoza claims that the things that make up the universe, including human beings, are God's "modes". This means that everything is, in some sense, dependent upon God. The nature of this dependence is disputed. Some scholars say that the modes are [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of God in the traditional sense. Others say that modes are [[Causality|effect]]s of God. Either way, the modes are also logically dependent on God's essence, in this sense: everything that happens [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the nature of God, just like how it follows from the nature of a triangle that its angles are equal to two right angles&lt;!--Spinoza's metaphor, not the editor's--&gt;. Since God had to exist with the nature he has, nothing that has happened could have been avoided, and if God has fixed a particular fate for a particular mode, there is no escaping it. As Spinoza puts it, "A thing which has been determined by God to produce an effect cannot render itself undetermined." God's creation of the universe is not a decision, much less one motivated by a purpose.

[[File:Spinoza - Structure Logique en √âthique.png|thumb|Logical structure of the first six propositions of Spinoza's ''Ethics'']]

===Part II: Of Nature &amp; Its Origin===
The second part focuses on the human mind and body. Spinoza attacks several [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] positions: (1) that the mind and body are distinct [[substance theory|substances]] that can affect one another; (2) that we know our minds better than we know our bodies; (3) that our senses may be trusted; (4) that despite being created by God we can make mistakes, namely, when we affirm, of our own free will, an idea that is not clear and distinct. Spinoza denies each of Descartes's points. Regarding (1), Spinoza argues that the mind and the body are [[nondualism|a single thing]] that is being thought of in two different ways. The whole of nature can be fully described in terms of thoughts or in terms of bodies. However, we cannot mix these two ways of describing things, as Descartes does, and say that the mind affects the body or vice versa. Moreover, the mind's self-knowledge is not fundamental: it cannot know its own thoughts better than it knows the ways in which its body is acted upon by other bodies.

Further, there is no difference between contemplating an idea and thinking that it is true, and there is no [[free will|freedom of the will]] at all. Sensory perception, which Spinoza calls "knowledge of the first kind", is entirely inaccurate, since it reflects how our own bodies work more than how things really are. We can also have a kind of accurate knowledge called "knowledge of the second kind", or "reason". This encompasses knowledge of the features common to all things, and includes principles of physics and geometry. We can also have "knowledge of the third kind", or "[[Intuition|intuitive knowledge]]". This is a sort of knowledge that, somehow, relates particular things to the nature of God.

===Part III: The Origin and Nature of Emotions===
In the third part of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza argues that all things, including human beings, strive to persevere in their being. This is usually taken to mean that things try to last for as long as they can. Spinoza explains how this striving ("[[conatus]]") underlies our [[emotion]]s (love, hate, joy, sadness and so on). Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.

===Part IV: Of the Servitude of Humanity, or the Strength of the Emotions===
The fourth part analyzes human passions, which Spinoza sees as aspects of the mind that direct us outwards to seek what gives pleasure and shun what gives pain. The "bondage" he refers to is domination by these passions or "[[affect (philosophy)|affect]]s" as he calls them. Spinoza considers how the affects, ungoverned, can torment people and make it impossible for mankind to live in harmony with one another.

===Part V: Of the Power of the Intellect, or the Liberty of Humanity===
The fifth part argues that reason can govern the affects in the pursuit of virtue, which for Spinoza is [[self-preservation]]: only with the aid of reason can humans distinguish the passions that truly aid virtue from those that are ultimately harmful. By reason, we can see things as they truly are, ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'', "under the aspect of eternity," and because Spinoza treats God and nature as indistinguishable, by knowing things as they are we improve our knowledge of God. Seeing that all things are determined by nature to be as they are, we can achieve the rational tranquility that best promotes our happiness, and liberate ourselves from being driven by our passions.

==Themes==
===God or Nature - ''Deus sive Natura''&lt;!--'God or Nature', 'Deus sive Natura' and 'Deus seu Natura' redirect here--&gt;===
According to Spinoza, God is Nature and Nature is God. This is his [[pantheism]]. In his previous book, ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', Spinoza discussed the inconsistencies that result when God is assumed to have human characteristics. In the third chapter of that book, he stated that the word "God" means the same as the word "Nature". He wrote: "Whether we say&amp;nbsp;... that all things happen according to the laws of nature, or are ordered by the decree and direction of God, we say the same thing." He later qualified this statement in his letter to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter XXI (Van Vloten LXXIII)&lt;/ref&gt; by abjuring [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The supposition of some, that I endeavor to prove in the ''Tractatus Theologico‚ÄìPoliticus'' the unity of God and Nature (meaning by the latter a certain mass or corporeal matter), is wholly erroneous."&lt;/ref&gt; Nature, to Spinoza, is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Substance theory|substance]], not physical matter.&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄùHaving established that Nature is an indivisible, infinite, uncaused, substantial whole‚Äîin fact, the ''only'' substantial whole; that outside of Nature there is nothing; and that everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into being by and within Nature with a deterministic necessity through Nature‚Äôs laws, Spinoza concludes that God and Nature‚Äîthe substantial, unique, unified, active, infinitely powerful, necessary cause of everything‚Äîare one and the same thing.‚Äù (''A Book Forged in Hell'', [[Steven Nadler]], ch.4)&lt;/ref&gt; In this posthumously published book ''Ethics'', he equated God with nature by writing ‚ÄúGod or Nature‚Äù four times.&lt;ref&gt;Twice in Part IV, Preface (''Deum seu Naturam'', ''Deus seu Natura''); twice in Part IV, Proposition IV, Proof (''Dei sive Natur√¶'', ''Dei seu Natur√¶'').&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äú...For Spinoza, God or Nature‚Äîbeing one and the same thing‚Äî is the whole, infinite, eternal, necessarily existing, active system of the universe within which absolutely everything exists. This is the fundamental principle of the ''Ethics''....‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Steven Nadler]], ''A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2011, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza holds that everything that exists is part of nature, and everything in nature follows the same basic laws. In this perspective, human beings are part of nature, and hence they can be explained and understood in the same way as everything else in nature. This aspect of Spinoza‚Äôs philosophy ‚Äî his [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] ‚Äî was radical for its time, and perhaps even for today. In the preface to Part III of ''Ethics'' (relating to emotions), he writes:

{{quote|Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating rather of matters outside nature than of natural phenomena following nature's general laws. They appear to conceive man to be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom : for they believe that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions, and that he is determined solely by himself. However, my argument is this. Nothing comes to pass in nature, which can be set down to a flaw therein ; for nature is always the same, and everywhere one and the same in her efficacy and power of action ; that is, nature's laws and ordinances, whereby all things come to pass and change from one form to another, are everywhere and always the same ; so that there should be one and the same method of understanding the nature of all things whatsoever, namely, through nature's universal laws and rules.| [[:s: Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 3|''Ethics'', Part 3]]}}

Therefore, Spinoza affirms that the passions of hatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, ‚Äúfollow from this same necessity and efficacy of nature; they answer to certain definite causes, through which they are understood, and possess certain properties as worthy of being known as the properties of anything else‚Äù. Humans are not different in kind from the rest of the natural world; they are part of it.&lt;ref name="Pynn"&gt;Cf. [http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf "Introduction to Spinoza‚Äôs ''Ethics''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226103559/http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf |date=2015-02-26 }}, by GeoÔ¨Ä Pynn, [[Northern Illinois University]], Spring 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza‚Äôs [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] can be seen as deriving from his firm commitment to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] ({{small caps|psr}}), which is the thesis that everything has an explanation. He articulates the {{small caps|psr}} in a strong fashion, as he applies it not only to everything that is, but also to everything that is not:

{{quote|Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned, either for its existence, ''or for its non-existence'' ‚Äî e.g. if a triangle exists, a reason or cause must be granted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted, which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XI]] (emphasis added)}}

And to continue with Spinoza's triangle example, here is one claim he makes about God:

{{quote|From God‚Äôs supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things ‚Äì that is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always flow from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XVII]]}}

Spinoza rejected the idea of an external Creator suddenly, and apparently capriciously, creating the world at one particular time rather than another, and creating it out of nothing. The solution appeared to him more perplexing than the problem, and rather unscientific in spirit as involving a break in continuity. He preferred to think of the entire system of reality as its own ground. This view was simpler; it avoided the impossible conception of creation out of nothing; and it was religiously more satisfying by bringing God and man into closer relationship. Instead of Nature, on the one hand, and a supernatural God, on the other, he posited one world of reality, at once Nature and God, and leaving no room for the supernatural. This so-called naturalism of Spinoza is only distorted if one starts with a crude materialistic idea of Nature and supposes that Spinoza degraded God. The truth is that he raised Nature to the rank of God by conceiving Nature as the fulness of reality, as the One and All. He rejected the specious simplicity obtainable by denying the reality of Matter, or of Mind, or of God. The cosmic system comprehends them all. In fact, God and Nature become identical when each is conceived as the Perfect Self-Existent. This constitutes Spinoza's ''Pantheism''.&lt;ref name="Pynn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Structure of reality===
[[File:Spinoza Ethica Pars1 Prop1.jpg|thumb|300px|Spinoza's original text of ''Ethica'', Part 1]]
According to Spinoza, God has "attributes". One attribute is 'extension', another attribute is 'thought', and there are infinitely many such attributes. Since Spinoza holds that to exist is to ''act'', some readers take 'extension' to refer to an activity characteristic of bodies (for example, the active process of taking up space, exercising physical power, or resisting a change of place or shape). They take 'thought' to refer to the activity that is characteristic of minds, namely thinking, the exercise of mental power. Each attribute has modes. All bodies are modes of extension, and all ideas are modes of thought.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Substance, attributes, modes====
Spinoza's ideas relating to the character and structure of reality are expressed by him in terms of ''substance'', ''attributes'', and ''modes''. These terms are very old and familiar, but not in the sense in which Spinoza employs them. To understand Spinoza, it is necessary to lay aside all preconceptions&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ "Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', publ. 21/08/2007.&lt;/ref&gt; about them, and follow Spinoza closely.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Spinoza, Baruch |volume=20 |pages=687‚Äì691 |first=Andrew Seth |last=Pringle-Pattison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also A. Wolf's, "Spinoza, the Man and His Thought", 1933; [[Antonio Damasio]], ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', William Heinemann, 2003, esp. ch. 6, 224‚Äì261; [[Richard McKeon]], ''The Philosophy of Spinoza: The Unity of His Thought'', Ox Bow Pr., 1928; Ray Monk &amp; Frederic Raphael, ''The Great Philosophers''. Phoenix, 2000, ''s.v.'' "Spinoza", pp. 135‚Äì174. See also the very useful Olli Koistinen (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza's Ethics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2009, esp. ch. 7, by Diane Steinberg, pp. 140‚Äì166.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza found it impossible to understand the finite, dependent, transient objects and events of experience without assuming some reality not dependent on anything else but self-existent, not produced by anything else but eternal, not restricted or limited by anything else but infinite. Such an uncaused, self-sustaining reality he called ''substance''. So, for instance, he could not understand the reality of material objects and physical events without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal physical force which expresses itself in all the movements and changes which occur, as we say, in [[space]].

This physical force he called ''extension'', and described it, at first, as a ''substance'', in the sense just explained. Similarly, he could not understand the various dependent, transient mental experiences with which we are familiar without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal consciousness, mental force, or mind-energy, which expresses itself in all these finite experiences of perceiving and understanding, of feeling and striving. This consciousness or mind-energy he called ''thought'', and described it also, at first, as a ''substance''.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;Especially valuable for these specific sections of Spinoza's thought as expounded in his ''Ethics'', have been the online pages by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' at these four links [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-physics/] ‚Äî which respectively represent an interpretation and commentary of the philosopher's stance on "Modal Metaphysics", "Theory of Attributes", "Psychological Theory", "Physical Theory", and are currently cited as a reference within the present text.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these "substances" he regarded as infinite of its kind (that is, as exhaustive of all the events of its own kind), and as irreducible to the other, or any other, substance. But in view of the intimate way in which Extension and Thought express themselves conjointly in the life of man, Spinoza considered it necessary to conceive of Extension and Thought not as detached realities, but as constituting one organic whole or system. And in order to express this idea, he then described Extension and Thought as ''attributes'', reserving the term ''Substance'' for the system which they constitute between them. This change of description was not intended to deny that Extension and Thought are substances in the sense of being self-existent, etc. It was only intended to express their coherence in one system. The system of course would be more than any one attribute. For each attribute is only ''infinite of its kind''; the system of all attributes is ''absolutely infinite'', that is, exhausts the whole of reality. Spinoza, accordingly, now restricted the term "substance" to the complete system, though he occasionally continued to use the phrase "substance or attribute", or described Extension as a substance.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

As commonly used, especially since the time of [[John Locke|Locke]], the term substance is contrasted with its attributes or qualities as their substratum or bearer. But this meaning must not be read into Spinoza. For Spinoza, Substance is not the support or bearer of the Attributes, but the system of Attributes ‚Äî he actually uses the expression "Substance or the Attributes."&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt; If there is any difference at all between "Substance" and "the Attributes", as Spinoza uses these terms, it is only the difference between the Attributes conceived as an organic system and the Attributes conceived (but not by Spinoza) as a mere sum of detached forces. Something is still necessary to complete the account of Spinoza's conception of Substance. So far only the two Attributes have been considered, namely, Extension and Thought. Spinoza, however, realised that there may be other Attributes, unknown to man. If so, they are part of the one Substance or cosmic system. And using the term "[[infinity|infinite]]" in the sense of "complete" or "exhaustive", he ascribed to Substance an infinity of Attributes, that is, all the attributes there are, whether known to man or not.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

Now reality, for Spinoza, is activity. Substance is incessantly active, each Attribute exercising its kind of energy in all possible ways. Thus the various objects and events of the material world come into being as ''modes'' (modifications or states) of the attribute Extension; and the various minds and mental experiences come into being as modes of the attribute Thought (or Consciousness). These modes are not external creations of the Attributes, but immanent results ‚Äî they are not "thrown off" by the Attributes, but are states (or modifications) of them, as air-waves are states of the air. Each Attribute, however, expresses itself in its finite modes not immediately (or directly) but mediately (or indirectly), at least in the sense to be explained now. [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] [[physics]] tended to regard the whole world of [[physical phenomena]] as the result of differences of [[motion (physics)|motion]] or [[momentum]]. And, though erroneously conceived, the Cartesian conception of a constant quantity of motion in the world led Spinoza to conceive of all physical phenomena as so many varying expressions of that store of motion (or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[Rest (physics)|rest]]).

Spinoza might, of course, have identified Extension with [[energy]] of motion. But, with his usual caution, he appears to have suspected that motion may be only one of several types of [[physical energy]]. So he described motion simply as a mode of Extension, but as an ''infinite'' mode (because complete or exhaustive of all finite modes of motion) and as an ''immediate'' mode (as a direct expression of Extension). Again, the physical world (or "the face of the world as a whole", as Spinoza calls it)&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; retains a certain sameness in spite of the innumerable changes in detail that are going on. Accordingly, Spinoza described also the physical world as a  whole as an ''infinite'' mode of extension ("infinite" because exhaustive of all facts and events that can be reduced to motion), but as a ''mediate'' (or indirect) mode, because he regarded it as the outcome of the conservation of motion (itself a mode, though an ''immediate'' mode). The physical things and events of ordinary experience are ''finite'' modes. In essence each of them is part of the Attribute Extension, which is active in each of them. But the finiteness of each of them is due to the fact that it is restrained or hedged in, so to say, by other finite modes. This limitation or determination is negation in the sense that each finite mode is ''not'' the whole attribute Extension; it is not the other finite modes. But each mode is positively real and ultimate as part of the Attribute.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

In the same kind of way the Attribute Thought exercises its activity in various mental processes, and in such systems of mental process as are called minds or souls. But in this case, as in the case of Extension, Spinoza conceives of the finite modes of Thought as mediated by infinite modes. The immediate infinite mode of Thought he describes as "the idea of God"; the mediate infinite mode he calls "the infinite idea" or "the idea of all things". The other Attributes (if any) must be conceived in an analogous manner. And the whole Universe or Substance is conceived as one dynamic system of which the various Attributes are the several world-lines along which it expresses itself in all the infinite variety of events.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://archive.org/details/spinozasshorttre00spinuoft ''The Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-being''],  London: A. &amp; C. Black, 2006 ‚Äì scanned, [[University of Toronto]], Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the persistent misinterpretation of [[Spinozism]] it is worth emphasizing the dynamic character of reality as Spinoza conceived it. The cosmic system is certainly a logical or rational system, according to Spinoza, for Thought is a constitutive part of it; but it is not ''merely'' a logical system ‚Äî it is dynamic as well as logical. His frequent use of [[geometry|geometrical]] illustrations affords no evidence at all in support of a purely [[logics|logico]]-[[mathematics|mathematical]] interpretation of his philosophy; for Spinoza regarded geometrical figures, not in a [[Plato]]nic or static manner, but as things traced out by moving [[particles]] or [[Line (geometry)|lines]], etc., that is, dynamically.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Marcello Colitti, ''Etica e politica di Baruch Spinoza'', Aliberti, 2010, esp. ''s.v.'' "Etica". {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Baruch Spinoza]], 1665.]]
{{quotation|''Without intelligence there is not rational life: and things are only good, in so far as they aid man in his enjoyment of the intellectual life, which is defined by intelligence. Contrariwise, whatsoever things hinder man's perfecting of his reason, and capability to enjoy the rational life, are alone called evil.''| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 4|''Ethics'', Part IV, Appendix V]]}}

For Spinoza, reality means activity, and the reality of anything expresses itself in a tendency to self-preservation ‚Äî to exist is to persist. In the lowest kinds of things, in so-called inanimate matter, this tendency shows itself as a "will to live". Regarded physiologically the effort is called ''appetite''; when we are conscious of it, it is called ''desire''. The moral categories, good and evil, are intimately connected with desire, though not in the way commonly supposed. Man does not desire a thing because he thinks it is good, or shun it because he considers it bad; rather he considers anything good if he desires it, and regards it as bad if he has an aversion for it. Now whatever is felt to heighten vital activity gives pleasure; whatever is felt to lower such activity causes pain. Pleasure coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called love, and pain coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called hate ‚Äî "love" and "hate" being used in the wide sense of "like" and "dislike". All human feelings are derived from pleasure, pain and desire. Their great variety is due to the differences in the kinds of external objects which give rise to them, and to the differences in the inner conditions of the individual experiencing them.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Spinoza gives a detailed analysis of the whole gamut of human feelings, and his account is one of the classics of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;For this and other affirmations about Spinoza's "psychology", cf. esp. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/ "Spinoza's Psychological Theory"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', rev. 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For the present purpose the most important distinction is that between "active" feelings and "passive" feelings (or "passions"). Man, according to Spinoza, is active or free in so far as any experience is the outcome solely of his own nature; he is passive, or a bondsman, in so far as any experience is due to other causes besides his own nature. The active feelings are all of them forms of self-realisation, of heightened activity, of strength of mind, and are therefore always pleasurable. It is the passive feelings (or "passions") which are responsible for all the ills of life, for they are induced largely by things outside us and frequently cause that lowered vitality which means pain. Spinoza next links up his ethics with his theory of knowledge, and correlates the moral progress of man with his intellectual progress. At the lowest stage of knowledge, that of "opinion", man is under the dominant influence of things outside himself, and so is in the bondage of the passions. At the next stage, the stage of "reason", the characteristic feature of the human mind, its intelligence, asserts itself, and helps to emancipate him from his bondage to the senses and external allurements. The insight gained into the nature of the passions helps to free man from their domination. A better understanding of his own place in the cosmic system and of the place of all the objects of his likes and dislikes, and his insight into the necessity which rules all things, tend to cure him of his resentments, regrets and disappointments. He grows reconciled to things, and wins peace of mind. In this way reason teaches acquiescence in the universal order, and elevates the mind above the turmoil of passion. At the highest stage of knowledge, that of "intuitive knowledge", the mind apprehends all things as expressions of the eternal [[cosmos]]. It sees all things in God, and God in all things. It feels itself as part of the eternal order, identifying its thoughts with cosmic thought and its interests with cosmic interests. Thereby it becomes eternal as one of the eternal ideas in which the Attribute Thought expresses itself, and attains to that "blessedness" which "is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself", that is, the perfect joy which characterises perfect self-activity. This is not an easy or a common achievement. "But", says Spinoza, "everything excellent is as difficult as it is rare."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

==Reception==
{{Main|Spinozism}}

Shortly after his death in 1677, Spinoza's works were placed on the Catholic Church's Index of Banned Books. Condemnations soon appeared, such as [[Noel Aubert de Vers√©|Aubert de Vers√©]]'s ''L'impie convaincu'' (1685). According to its subtitle, in this work "the foundations of [Spinoza's] atheism are refuted".

For the next hundred years, if European philosophers read this so-called heretic, they did so almost entirely in secret. How much forbidden Spinozism they were sneaking into their diets remains a subject of continual intrigue. Locke, Hume, Leibniz and Kant all stand accused by later scholars of indulging in periods of closeted Spinozism.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Boehm, Omri. 2014. ''Kant's Critique of Spinoza''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 18th century, a [[Pantheism controversy|controversy]] centering on the ''Ethics'' scandalized the German philosophy scene.

The first known translation of the ''Ethics'' into English was completed in 1856 by the novelist [[George Eliot]], though not published until much later. The book next appeared in English in 1883, by the hand of the novelist [[Hale White]]. Spinoza rose clearly into view for anglophone metaphysicians in the late nineteenth century, during the British craze for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In his admiration for Spinoza, Hegel was joined in this period by his countrymen [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In the twentieth century, the ghost of Spinoza continued to show itself, for example in the writings of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]. Among writers of fiction and poetry, the students of Spinoza include [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], George Eliot, [[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], and [[Bernard Malamud|Malamud]].

The first published Dutch translations were by the poet [[Herman Gorter]] (1895) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Loman en Funke, The Hague, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; and by Willem Meyer (1896) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Van Looy, Amsterdam, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Criticism==
{{importance section}}
===Misuse of words===
[[Schopenhauer]] claimed that Spinoza misused words. ‚ÄúThus he calls ‚ÄòGod‚Äô that which is everywhere called ‚Äòthe world‚Äô; ‚Äòjustice‚Äô that which is everywhere called ‚Äòpower‚Äô; and ‚Äòwill‚Äô that which is everywhere called ‚Äòjudgement‚Äô.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', vol, I, ‚ÄúSketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,‚Äù p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ‚Äúthat concept of ''substance''...with the definition of which Spinoza accordingly begins...appears on close and honest investigation to be a higher yet unjustified abstraction of the concept ''matter''.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', vol, I, ‚ÄúFragments for the History of Philosophy,‚Äù ¬ß 12, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his repeated objections and critical remarks, Schopenhauer incorporated some of Spinoza's fundamental concepts into his system, especially concerning the theory of emotions; there was also a striking similarity between Schopenhauer's will and Spinoza's substance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry Walter Bran, [http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 ''Philosophy and History''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415153349/http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 |date=2013-04-15 }}, on "Schopenhauer and Spinoza", Vol. 4, Issue 1, 1971, pp. 17‚Äì18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical influence===
In fact, within the German philosophical sphere, Spinoza‚Äôs influence on [[German Idealism]] was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;A very detailed examination of Spinoza‚Äôs influence on German Idealism is given in Jean-Marie Vaysse, ''Totalite et Subjectivite: Spinoza dans l‚ÄôIdealisme Allemand'', Vrin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement: [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Fichte]] ‚Äî who all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his. Schopenhauer, who detested these three philosophers to varying degrees of intensity,&lt;ref&gt;His vicious attacks on Hegel stand out: once he called him "a commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive and ignorant charlatan..."{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007224123/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/arthursc%2Ehtm |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also had a similarly ambivalent relation to the Dutch philosopher. How Spinoza came to influence Schopenhauer is not clear, but one might speculate: it could have come from his exposure to Fichte‚Äôs lectures, from his  conversations with [[Goethe]] or simply from being caught up in the post-[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian attempt to rethink the [[Critical Philosophy]]. Still, his engagement with [[Spinozism]] is evident throughout his writings and attentive readers of his chief work may indeed note his ambivalence toward Spinoza‚Äôs philosophy. He sees in Spinoza an ally against the feverish culture of the West. For example, in the context of a rather favourable account of "the standpoint of affirmation" he notes that ‚Äú[T]he philosophy of [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and that of Spinoza might also bring to this standpoint the person whose conviction was not shaken or weakened by their errors and imperfections‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', trans. E.F.G. Payne, Dover Books, 1958 [Voll. I &amp; II originally published in 1819 and 1844, respectively], Vol. I, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in discussing Spinoza and Giordano Bruno, Schopenhauer also affirms that:

{{quote|They do not belong either to their age or to their part of the globe, which rewarded the one with death, and the other with persecution and ignominy. Their miserable existence and death in this Western world are like that of a tropical plant in Europe. The banks of the [[Ganges]] were their spiritual home; there they would have led a peaceful and honoured life among men of like mind.|''[[The World as Will and Representation|World]]'', I, 422, n. 2}}

Given Schopenhauer‚Äôs respect for [[Hindu philosophy]], comments like these indicate that he too felt intellectual kinship with Spinoza. Elsewhere, Schopenhauer points to more fundamental affinities, but he also criticizes Spinoza. These criticisms deal with fundamental disagreements about the ultimate nature of reality and whether it is to be affirmed or denied.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. essay by Bela Egyed, [http://philosophy.concordia.ca/documents/247.pdf "Spinoza, Schopenhauer and the Standpoint of Affirmation"], on ''PhaenEx'' 2, no. 1 (spring/summer 2007): pp. 110‚Äì131. The author argues that "Schopenhauer‚Äôs ambivalence toward Spinoza‚Äôs philosophy is a reflection of an inner tension within his own doctrine of the denial of the will-to-live, and that his criticisms of Spinoza are related to his rejection of the standpoint of affirmation. In addition ... if this tension is resolved in favour of the standpoint of affirmation, Schopenhauer‚Äôs own ethics turns out to be closer to Spinoza‚Äôs than he takes it to be." Egyed also offers a suggestion about the possible relation of Schopenhauer‚Äôs philosophy to two different strains of [[Buddhist philosophy]]: [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fantasy Unlimited''' was a [[multimedia]] artists [[collective]] in New York.

==History==
The collective was founded by Peter Nevard in 1967. One of the co-founders was [[David Edward Byrd]], whom Peter knew from art school.
The collective lived and worked on a {{convert|110|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm on the bank of the [[Neversink River]] in [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis, NY]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.david-edward-byrd.com/biocontact-1.html Fantasy Unlimited Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;
Peter Nevard was the leader and had most of the equipment and financial know-how.

The collective consisted of seven artists and did about one major commercial light show a month. These were, at that time, called Press Shows - a new product was presented with strobe lights, liquid projections, slide projections, film, smoke, bubbles, and modern dancers in flesh body suits. David Edward Byrd created projections, art slides, and glass paintings and ran special effects during the various shows.

Notable work:
*[[Clairol]], "The Innocence of Blonde" with [[Cheryl Tiegs]] (for Clairol's Innocent Blond range of products)
*[[Yardley of London|Yardley]] cosmetics, "The Yardley London Look" with [[Jean Shrimpton]]
*[[Bill Blass Limited|Bill Blass]], "The Bill Blass Collection" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billblass.com/ The Bill Blass Collection on the official website]&lt;/ref&gt;
but also work for:
*[[Bloomingdale's]]
*Boussac of France (fabrics, now part of Pierre Frey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierrefrey.com/ The Pierre Frey website]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*[[Dayton's|Dayton‚Äôs of Minneapolis]]
*[[Polo Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren]]
*[[Oscar de la Renta]]
*[[Tenneco]] Chemicals
among others. 

In early 1968, work was started for [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] for venues of major stars in the new [[Fillmore East]] Ballroom in [[East Village, Manhattan|Manhattan‚Äôs East Village]].  

Fantasy Unlimited created posters and other art work for, among others, [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].

Although the collective only existed for a few years, and may not have been a force culturally, it made some notable contributions (especially the work of David Edward Byrd).

==Trivia==
Clairol's catchphrase: "Does She... Or Doesn't She?" was coined by [[Shirley Polykoff]]

The flag was designed by Brady Ells and Ian Chadwick and consists of a gold cross fimbriated in black on a maroon field and a rose in the centre.&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/flags/northamptonshire/|title=Northamptonshire|work=The Flag Institute|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the winning design of a shortlist of four put forward for a public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton-news-hp.co.uk/designs-new-Northamptonshire-flag-public-vote/story-21677620-detail/story.html|title=Four designs for new Northamptonshire flag put to public vote|work=Northampton Herald &amp; Post|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross represents the county's location as a crossroads in England, the colours were inspired by the county's [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|cricket team]] and county town's [[Northampton Town F.C.|football team]], and the black border represents the county's leather industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/northamptonshire-unveils-its-first-ever-official-county-flag-1-6294269|title=Northamptonshire unveils its first ever official county flag|work=northamptonchron.co.uk|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-10-25/new-flag-of-northamptonshire-raised-at-county-hall/|title=New flag of Northamptonshire raised at County Hall|work=ITV News|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rose was selected for the centre as it has long been a symbol for the county. The rose design was created based on research into roses used in the past to represent the county, and a final design included elements of these historic depictions.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

==Use==
The flag was unveiled at a special ceremony at the Northamptonshire County Hall by [[Northamptonshire County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/news/Latestnews/Pages/county-flag-competition-update.aspx|title=County flag unveiled|work=northamptonshire.gov.uk|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was raised above the building on 25 October 2014 to coincide with the newly created County Day, held on [[St Crispin's Day]].&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

[[Image:Donostia Aizpurua Klub Nautikoa.jpg|thumb|''[[w:es:Club N√°utico de San Sebasti√°n|Club N√°utico de San Sebasti√°n]]'' (1929) designed by [[Jos√© Manuel Aizp√∫rua]] and [[Joaqu√≠n Labayen]]]]
'''GATEPAC''' (Grupo de Artistas y T√©cnicos Espa√±oles Para la Arquitectura Contempor√°nea) was a group of architects assembled during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Its most important members were: [[Josep Llu√≠s Sert]], [[Antoni Bonet Castellana]], [[Josep Torres Clav√©]], [[Jos√© Manuel Aizpur√∫a]], [[Fernando Garc√≠a Mercadal]] and [[Sixte Illescas]].

The group was formed in the 1930s as a Spanish branch of [[C.I.A.M.]] The Eastern (Catalan) and founding section of the group, called [[GATCPAC]] (Grup d'Arquitectes i T√®cnics Catalans per al Progr√©s de l'Arquitectura Contempor√†nia) was much more successful than the Central or Northern sections, and carried out government contracts during the Second Republic.  GATCPAC also published the magazine ''A.C.'', or ''Actividad Contempor√°nea'', which remains an important document for the history of Modern Movement in Spain.

Most, but not all GATEPAC members fought on the Republican side during the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Torres Clav√© was killed in action.  [[Josep Llu√≠s Sert]] went into exile in the United States, where he would teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].  Antoni Bonet established himself in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Having been associated with the Second Republic, GATEPAC was taboo in [[Francoist Spain]] and reference to it was often censored until the 1950s, when their works were taken up by a new generation of Spanish modern architects like the Catalan [[Oriol Bohigas]].

'''''Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief''''' is a 2013 [[non-fiction]] book about [[Scientology]] written by [[Lawrence Wright]].

The book contains interviews with current and former Scientologists, the histories of founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and current leader [[David Miscavige]], and analysis of the relationships of [[Tom Cruise]] and [[John Travolta]] to the organization. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' Wright said that "There are a lot of people out there who were very high up in the church and know a lot about it who have become outspoken... I'm very lucky to come along at a time when a lot of these people are ready to talk".&lt;ref name="Mcgrath"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mcgrath |first=Charles |title=Scientology Fascinates the Author Lawrence Wright |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 January 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/books/scientology-fascinates-the-author-lawrence-wright.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright also disclosed that he has received "innumerable" letters threatening legal action from lawyers representing Scientology and celebrities who belong to it.&lt;ref name="Mcgrath"/&gt; Wright spoke to two hundred current and former Scientologists for the book.&lt;ref name="Mcgrath"/&gt; It was originally published in the United Kingdom by Transworld but is now being published by Silvertail, which may be because of legal pressure from the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/going-cear-scientology-hollywood-and-the-prison-of-belief-by-lawrence-wright-review-a3211501.html|title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of belief - review|author=|date=|website=standard.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book, ''Going Clear'', is in reference to a stage of spiritual development in Scientology. In [[Scientology terminology|Scientology parlance]], "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]" means a state of having freed oneself from "engrams", which members believe are "subconscious memories of past trauma". Scientologists go through therapy sessions called "auditing" as part of the process of becoming Clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NPR Staff | url = https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171096563/hollywood-hot-shots-scientology-and-a-story-worth-the-risk-in-going-clear | title = Hollywood Hot Shots, Scientology and a Story Worth the Risk in 'Going Clear' |work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=February 6, 2013 | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright had previously written a profile of former Scientologist [[Paul Haggis]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Apostate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |title= The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=14 February 2011 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-apostate-lawrence-wright

==Reception==
The publishers [[Transworld Publishers|Transworld]] cancelled their publication of the book in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ind07Jan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/scientologists-believe-the-holocaust-was-planned-and-carried-out-by-psychiatrists-8440369.html|author=John Sweeney|title='Scientologists believe the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists'|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transworld made an internal decision not to publish the book following legal advice, feeling that an edited version would not fit with their schedule.

Wright‚Äôs German publisher, [[Random House|Random House Publishing Group]], provided the internet addresses of the Church of Scientology‚Äôs published responses in a disclaimer in the front of the German edition and a disclaimer that none of the stories contained in the book concern the German branch of the church.&lt;ref name='Link to book on Random House website'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.randomhouse.de/Buch/Im-Gefaengnis-des-Glaubens/Lawrence-Wright/e391372.rhd?mid=4&amp;serviceAvailable=true&amp;showpdf=false#tabbox | title = Random House Publishing | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lawrence Wright signing Going Clear.jpg|right|thumb|Lawrence Wright signing a copy of ''Going Clear'']]
''Going Clear'' has been challenged by the Church of Scientology International. The Church published an official statement in its newsroom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/statements/scientology-statement-wright-book.html |title=Statement on Lawrence Wright‚Äôs book |accessdate=2013-11-29 |author=Church of Scientology International |date=2013-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235039/http://www.scientologynews.org/statements/scientology-statement-wright-book.html |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a blog listing its refutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lawrencewrightgoingclear.com/ | title = How Lawrence Wright Got It So Wrong: A Correction of the Falsehoods in Lawrence Wright's Book on Scientology | accessdate = 2013-11-29 | author = Church of Scientology International | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been comments about the disagreements between Wright and the Church of Scientology in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/23/scientologists-claim-errors-in-lawrence-wright-book.html | title = Scientology vs. Lawrence Wright | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scientology-author-talks-of-churchs-presence-in-dc/article/2519834 |title=Scientology author talks of church's presence in D.C. |accessdate=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen Swartz reviewed the book for the Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, writing that Wright achieves his goal for the book, providing ‚Äúa rich history that engages current questions,‚Äù while allowing for a ‚Äúmore nuanced discourse‚Äù of the meaning of religion, while perpetuating a ‚Äúheavily Protestant understanding.‚Äù She also comments that the author recognizes the lack of information provided by the Church and encourages readers to research further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contemporary Esotericism |journal=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions |year=2013 |last=Swartz |first=Karen |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=125-127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark Collis reviewed the book for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', writing:

{{quote|Lawrence Wright, who won a Pulitzer for 2006's ''[[The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11]]'', interviewed roughly 200 current and former Scientologists for the book, which began as a 2011 ''New Yorker'' article written with Haggis' cooperation. You can feel the heft of the research as he details Hubbard's establishment of the church in the '50s, its globe-spanning infiltration of government agencies in the '70s, and the more recent alleged physical abuse suffered by some members (the Church of Scientology denies many of the claims...) ''Going Clear'' is peppered with examples of the church lavishly accommodating its A-list members, particularly Tom Cruise, if not always dealing so well with its famous congregants' quips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last= Collis |first= Clark |authorlink= |title= Going Clear |journal= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= January 25 ‚Äì February 1, 2013 |location= New York |publisher= Time Inc. |page= 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Going Clear (film)}}
The book was adapted into a documentary film by [[HBO]], directed by [[Alex Gibney]], and premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2015. It had been stated by HBO documentary films chief Sheila Nevins that HBO had 160 lawyers review the film out of concerns about litigation by the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/24/we_have_probably_160_lawyers_hbo_readies_documentary_on_church_of_scientology/ |title="We have probably 160 lawyers": HBO readies documentary on Church of Scientology |publisher=Salon.com |author=Sarah Gray |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later called hyperbole by Gibney, though the film was scrutinized by HBO's lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/15/media/scientology-documentary-alex-gibney/ |title="Scientology mounts media offensive against upcoming HBO documentary |publisher=money.cnn.com |author=Brian Stelter |date=March 15, 2015 |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4385">'''Harlem Writers Guild''' (HWG) is the oldest organization of [[African-American]] writers, founded in 1950 by [[John Oliver Killens]], [[Rosa Guy]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], Willard Moore and Walter Christmas.&lt;ref name=HWG&gt;[http://theharlemwritersguild.org/about.html "About"], Harlem Writers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Harlem Writers Guild was set up as a forum where African-American writers could develop their craft. After funding for an organization active in the late 1940s called "The Committee for the Negro in the Arts" ended, these writers felt excluded from the mainstream literary culture of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald D. Jaynes, [http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/africanamericansociety/n308.xml "Harlem Writers Guild"], ''Encyclopedia of African American Society'', SAGE Publications, Inc., 2005, {{ISBN|9780761927648}}. Online September 15, 2007. DOI: 10.4135/9781412952507, {{ISBN|9781412952507}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The HWG was also part of the [[Black Arts Movement]] of the 1960s, and its rationale continues to be to develop and aid in the publication of works by writers of the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theharlemwritersguild.org/index.html "Who We Are"], Harlem Writers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who have been associated with the HWG include [[Lonne Elder III]], [[Douglas Turner Ward]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Paule Marshall]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maya Angelou]] and [[Sarah E. Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Gerald Fraser, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/obituaries/john-oliver-killens-71-author-and-founder-of-writers-group.html "John Oliver Killens, 71, Author And Founder of Writers' Group"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 30, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the HWG was honored by the [[United Nations]] (UN) Society of Writers.&lt;ref name=HWG /&gt; In 1986, John O. Killens estimated that members of the Harlem Writers Guild had produced more than 300 published works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays, and screenplays. Several have received literary acclaim. Past and present members include: Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Grace F. Edwards, Rosa Guy, Rachel DeAragon, John Oliver Killens, [[Walter Dean Myers]], [[Louise Meriwether]], Karen Robinson, Dr. Olubansile Abbas Mimiko and Sarah E. Wright, Audrey Lorde, Paule Marshall, [[Julian Mayfield]], [[Terry McMillan]], Robert McNatt, Lofton Mitchell, Wilbert Oliver, Funmi Osoba, [[Sidney Poitier]], Charles Russell, K. C. Washington, Minnette Coleman, Gammy Singer, [[Wilbert Tatum]], Brenda Wilkinson, [[Valerie Wilson Wesley]], Sarah Elizabeth Wright, Sandra L. West, [[Doris Jean Austin]], William H. Banks Jr., Wesley Brown, Rosemary Bray, [[Irving Burgie]], Judy C. Andrews, [[Godfrey Cambridge]], Andrea Broadwater, [[Alice Childress]], Ossie Davis, [[Ruby Dee]], James DeJongh, Lonne Elder III, Donis Ford, Bill William Forde, [[Lorraine Hansberry]], Bob Desverney, Dr. Beryl Dorsett, Sheila Doyle, Lloyd Hairston, Robert Hooks, Rose James, Alfonso Nicks, and Betty Ann Jackson. Among writers more recently added to the HWG roster are: Angela Dews, Cordenia Paige, Eartha Watts Hicks, Sylvia White, and Miriam Kelly Ferguson.

===Harlem Writers Guild Press===

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a Canadian [[Academic tenure|untenured]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Rogers]] (18 May 2017). [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html "The Uproar Over 'Transracialism'"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared aspects of the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017&gt;Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"], ''New York'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within [[feminism]] and academic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

In the article‚Äî"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April‚ÄîTuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2017|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/pdf|title=In Defense of Transracialism|work=Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=(263‚Äì278), 264|doi-access=free|doi=10.1111/hypa.12327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full|archive-date=10 May 2017|dead-url=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]  began criticizing the article and attacking Tuvel. From 29 April an open letter, naming a member of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

On 1 May a post appeared on the journal's Facebook page apologizing for the article's publication, on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]]. ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editor-in-chief, [[Sally Scholz]], and its board of directors stood by the article.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuessler19May2017&gt;Schuessler, Jennifer (19 May 2017).

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the article after noticing the contrast, in 2015, between the reception given to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===

Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]. Assuming there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel then argues for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&amp;nbsp;... self-identification".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} She maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]‚Äîa feature external to the body‚Äîis a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Tuvel suggests that Dolezal's exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], self-identification as black, and living as someone society had accepted as black, would be enough to deem her black. From a genetic standpoint, there is no matter of fact, no "real race", Tuvel writes.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=266‚Äì267}}

Four objections to [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] are addressed and rejected. The first is that a claim to be black cannot be accepted without the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; Tuvel quotes the journalist [[Tour√© (journalist)|Tour√©]], who called this the "one thing that binds black people"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"], ''RealClear Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Following this argument, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}

The second objection holds that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed on ancestry (in America, at least). No matter the genetic facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters; it is crucial because it is regarded as crucial. Tuvel argues that this position‚Äîespoused by [[Cressida Heyes]], the associate editor who posted the apology‚Äîholds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo". How racial categorization does operate is not necessarily how it should operate.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268‚Äì269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the harmful practice of [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between what she calls problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification is not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; her change does not appear to be temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=269‚Äì270}}

A fourth objection holds that Dolezal is engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege". This argument holds that a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it; a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel quotes the writer Tamara Winfrey Harris: "I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}}; Harris, Tamara Winfrey (16 June 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/rachel-dolezals-harmful-masquerade.html "Black Like Who? Rachel Dolezal‚Äôs Harmful Masquerade"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition. She argues further than the exercise of privilege is a separate issue. That more men than women get jobs as philosophy professors does not mean we should get rid of philosophy professors; instead, we should address the inequality. Similarly, if society comes to accept transracialism, it could be made easier for all races to transition. Tuvel adds that it is hard to see how Dolezal could be accused of exercising white privilege by choosing to give it up.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270‚Äì271}}

Finally, Tuvel asks whether, if we accept her position, we are obliged to accept any and all self-identification, such as individuals who [[Otherkin|identify as nonhuman]]. She repeats that two components are necessary for a successful change: self-identification and social acceptance of the new identity. It is reasonable to ask that social acceptance depend on it being possible for individuals to imagine what it is like to exist and be treated as a member of the category they seek to join. Without that, there is "too little commonality to make the group designation meaningful".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=272}}

Botts was unable to attend, but she submitted a couple of paragraphs in reply to Tuvel and the panel members, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the United States in the 21st century is that it is an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".

==Social-media response==
===Criticism===
On Friday, 28 April 2017, Tuvel and the article came under attack on Facebook and Twitter. Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in "epistemic violence".&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017&gt;[[Kelly Oliver|Oliver, Kelly]] (7 May 2017).

Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University, who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt; made an effort on Facebook to defend Tuvel by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable", and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up. Several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article.  A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn‚Äôt retract her article."&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt; Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;

Nora Berenstain, [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]], wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained "egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;{{efn|Berenstain said that the term "violence" referred to "structural violence", which she described as "a range of systemic harms that go beyond direct interpersonal physical contact".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite women-of-color philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name ([[deadnaming]]), and her use of the terms "transgenderism", "biological sex" and "male genitalia". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

Delivered on 2 May to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editor-in-chief,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; the letter urged the journal to retract the article; avoid deadnaming; open its editorial procedures to scrutiny; release a statement about how it plans to improve its review process; and undertake to involve in future "people targeted by transphobia and racism and scholars who specialize in the related relevant subfields of philosophy".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; It alleged that the article had fallen "short of scholarly standards":

{{quote|1.  It uses vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields; for example, the author uses the language of ‚Äútransgenderism‚Äù and engages in [[deadnaming]] a trans woman;

2.  It mischaracterizes various theories and practices relating to religious identity and conversion; for example, the author gives an off-hand example about conversion to Judaism;

3.  It misrepresents leading accounts of belonging to a racial group; for example, the author incorrectly cites [[Charles W. Mills|Charles Mills]] as a defender of voluntary racial identification;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of ‚Äútransracialism‚Äù. We endorse Hypatia's stated commitment to "actively reflect and engage the diversity within feminism, the diverse experiences and situations of women, and the diverse forms that gender takes around the globe," and we find that this submission was published without being held to that commitment.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;"Open letter to Hypatia", Google Docs.

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to Justin Weinberg, [[associate professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of South Carolina]], and Jesse Singal of ''New York'' magazine, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Regarding the term ''transgenderism'', [[GLAAD]] does caution against its use. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name that Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable; it consisted of a paragraph explaining that, barring (for example) objections from the rabbi that the prospective convert is not committed to Judaism, those who wish to become Jews can do so.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Weinberg also argued that Tuvel had not identified Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; he wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including 'self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification' (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}}

The criticism that Tuvel had not cited enough women of color may be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Weinberg argued that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out a particular work that was both directly relevant and that had been omitted.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017&gt;Justin Weinberg (1 May 2017).

===Associate editors' apology===
On 30 April 2017‚Äîtwo days before the open letter was delivered to ''Hypatia''‚Äî[[Cressida Heyes]], then one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s 10 associate editors,&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors". The post was later removed or made private. On 1 May it was reposted to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page, this time ending with "Sincerely, A Majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors".&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heyes |first1=Cressida |author-link=Cressida Heyes|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |publisher=Personal Facebook page|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qKlW3Fnc |archivedate=9 May 2017 |date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}{{pb}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;To compare ethically the lived experience of trans people (from a distinctly external perspective) primarily to a single example of a white person claiming to have adopted a black identity creates an equivalency that fails to recognize the history of racial appropriation, while also associating trans people with racial appropriation. We recognize and mourn that these harms will disproportionately fall upon those members of our community who continue to experience marginalization and discrimination due to racism and cisnormativity.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published", and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined to name the anonymous reviewers.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement, on 1 May 2017, in response to the associate editors' apology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this piece from a place of support for those with non-normative identities, and frustration about the ways individuals who inhabit them are so often excoriated, body-shamed, and silenced. When the case of Rachel Dolezal surfaced, I perceived a transphobic logic that lay at the heart of the constant attacks against her. My article is an effort to extend our thinking alongside transgender theories to other non-normative possibilities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the parenthetical reference to Jenner's previous name,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; which was removed from the article at her request on 4&amp;nbsp;May.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017}} She also acknowledged that "[a] valid reproach is that my article discusses the lives of vulnerable people without sufficiently citing their own first-person experiences and views." Expressing concern about the personal attacks and hate mail she had received, including from commentators who had not read the article, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&amp;nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger", and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===Early response from ''Hypatia''===
[[Sally Scholz]], the journal's editor-in-chief, offered her support to Tuvel on 6 May, writing that "it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data)." The board of associate editors was a policy board with no role in the journal's management, she wrote, and it had acted independently in drafting and posting the letter.{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating‚Äîstudents and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Scholz's position was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. Scholz, the board and the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/finally-a-meek-and-halfhearted-defense-of-rebecca-tuvel-from-hypatia/article/2008107 "Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia"], ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], [[Leslie Francis]] (treasurer), Heidi Grasswick (secretary), Solomon (president), and [[Lisa Tessman]] (chair), it acknowledged the "intensity of experience and convictions around matters of intersectionality", and the "egregious history of treatment of women of color feminists and feminists from other marginalized social positions" within academic philosophy. Dismissing the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a strong response, the board wrote that such a view from "outsiders" reflects "ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization, disrespect, and misrepresentation of oppressed groups".&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Journal-s-Board-Disavows/240116 "Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement continued that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation with the editor-in-chief and on their own behalf only. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief and that the article would not be retracted "barring discovery of misconduct or plagiarism". The associate editors' apology remained on ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page; on 25 May 2017 it was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors.&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt;

===Early academic reaction===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archivedate=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of harm had been "twisted beyond all recognition" by the associate editors' letter, according to Jos√© Luis Berm√∫dez, professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Berm√∫dez, Jos√© Luis (5 May 2017). [https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/05/05/real-damage-done-flare-over-philosophers-journal-article-essay "Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair"], ''Inside Higher Ed''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Several commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; Dan Kaufman, professor of philosophy at [[Missouri State University]], blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".&lt;ref&gt;Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). [http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/dan-kaufman/ "Interview with Dan Kaufman"], ''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that certain issues can be covered only by particular categories of scholar, and that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. For Brubaker, acknowledging himself as a white cisgender man, this position means not only that certain topics are too easily closed off to particular scholars, but that scholars with [[lived experience]] are expected to focus on those topics.&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;

Systemic [[sexism]] within the discipline was cited. There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process that had allowed the paper to be published. "What you do when someone submits the paper is you find people who are experts in that area to review it," she told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', "to make sure that it is situated within contemporary scholarly discussions. Obviously they didn‚Äôt do that."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], later appointed co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Tuvel-s-Article-So/240029 "Why Tuvel‚Äôs Article So Troubled Its Critics"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Traldi argued in ''[[Quillette]]'' that the dispute was partly attributable to the influence of [[Continental philosophy|continental]] as opposed to [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophy, and the idea that philosophy should be a vehicle for social change, rather than an impartial search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Traldi, Oliver (9 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' resignations and task force===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suar√©z21July2017/&gt; On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Weinberg21July2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia‚Äôs Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archivedate=26 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archivedate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interim&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archivedate=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suar√©z21July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suar√©z|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], [[Serene Khader]] and Yannik Thiem were named as co-chairs of the governance task force, and [[Ann Garry]], Serene Khader, and [[Alison Stone]] were appointed as interim editors.&lt;ref name=interim/&gt; In February 2018 the five-person board of directors was replaced.&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018/&gt; [[Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff]] and Kim Hall, two of the associate editors who resigned in July,&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017/&gt; became, respectively, president of the board of directors and chair of the search committee for the new editorial team.&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement from Hypatia's Board of Directors and Task Force Co-Chairs|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|publisher=''Hypatia''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164503/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=23 February 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 symposium, Mellon Foundation grant===
[[Peg Birmingham]], editor of ''[[Philosophy Today]]'', published a symposium on Tuvel's article in the journal's Winter 2018 edition, with contributions from Chlo√´ Taylor (Alberta), [[Lewis Gordon]] ([[University of Connecticut|UConn]]), Kris Sealey ([[Fairfield University|Fairfield]]), Sabrina Hom ([[Georgia College &amp; State University|GCSU]]), Tina Fernandes Botts and Rebecca Tuvel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pdcnet.org/collection-anonymous/browse?fp=philtoday&amp;fq=philtoday%2fVolume%2f8938%7c62%2f8999%7cIssue%3a+1%2f "Special symposium: Rebecca Tuvel and her interlocutors"], ''Philosophy Today''. 62(1), Winter 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 the [[Andrew W.

'''''Into Thin Air: Death on Everest''''' is a 1997 American [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[television film]] based on [[Jon Krakauer]]'s memoir ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' (1997). The film, directed by [[Robert Markowitz]] and written by [[Robert J. Avrech]], tells the story of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]]. It was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] on November 9, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Into Thin Air: Death on Everest|date=November 9, 1997|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/178032/Into-Thin-Air-Death-on-Everest/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film portrays the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] and the events that preceded it. The film mainly follows [[Jon Krakauer]], the author of the book on which the film is based (''[[Into Thin Air]]: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster'' (1997)); it also follows the climbing teams of summit guides [[Rob Hall]] and [[Scott Fischer]].

The film begins with Krakauer giving a monologue about the events about the disaster. The guides, Rob Hall (Nat Parker), and Scott Fischer (Peter Horton) introduce themselves, their teams, and discuss with the clients how they intend to reach the summit by the set date. Hall's group contains Doug Hansen, a mailman from Seattle, Krakauer, Yasuko Namba, and several others. Fischer's group contains a New York socialite, Sandy Pittman, who will perform what Krakauer does for Hall's group, reporting and bring attention. At base camp, Hall speaks with his pregnant wife Jan, in New Zealand, about potential names for their daughter. The groups slowly make their way through camps 2, 3, and 4, and then begin their ascent for the summit. However, in camp 2, Fischer is forced to go all the way back down, so he can take a sick client, Dale Cruz, down for help. Scott refuses help, and returns exhausted and out of breath.

The ascent begins well, with both groups making steady pace. However, upon reaching the bottom of the Hillary step, they realize that there are no fixed ropes. The Sherpa there states it's a two-person job, and the other Sherpa never arrived, mostly due to being too tired and sick from dragging Pittman and all of her heavy equipment all the way up. Mountain Madness guides Anatoli Boukreev and Neil Beidelman set the fixed ropes, but by then dozens of climbers had already reached the step, and now a large jam is at the bottom. Krakauer continues up, and reaches the summit with Anatoli Boukreev, where shortly afterward they are joined by Adventure Consultants guide Andy Harris. Krakauer begins his descent, but reaches the step only the find the jam has only gotten worse, and is forced to wait it out. Meanwhile, Hall is forced to tell client Doug Hansen that they have to turn around and go back. Hansen refuses, as he failed to reach the summit the year before, and he knows he won't be able to afford a third attempt. Hall and Hansen argue before Hall finally caves in and they continue, missing Hall's 2:00 PM turnaround time. Finally, the path down the step clears and Harris begins to descend; Krakauer meanwhile begins to hallucinate from a lack of oxygen. Earlier he had asked Harris to decrease his oxygen flow, but Harris instead increased it, and Krakauer nearly falls over the side, but manages to catch himself. He makes his way down the step and to Harris, and realizes something is wrong with Harris, who thinks the completely full bottles at the oxygen drop are empty. As he descends, he runs into Hansen and Hall, and points out to Hansen that storm clouds are making their way up through the valley and up the mountain.

Shortly after 3 PM, the majority of Hall's and Fischer's groups finally reach the summit. As Krakauer continues his descent, he runs into Scott Fischer, who is completely exhausted and refuses to turn around. Shortly after 4 PM, Rob Hall and Doug Hansen finally reach the summit, where Hall remarks to Hansen that a storm is coming. As he continues to go down, and the weather starts to get bad, Krakauer runs into Beck Weathers, sitting alone by himself in snow. Weathers had eye surgery performed prior to the trip, and has lost vision in his eyes during the summit ascent. He declines to leave with Krakauer, explaining he had promised Rob Hall that he would wait for him to go down. At 4:30, Fischer and his Sherpa, Lopsang, finally reach the summit where Scott feels ill and collapses. Around 5, Krakauer finally reaches the tents at camp 4, where he goes to sleep. The weather continues to worsen, and later, Beidelman, Mike Groom, and the majority of both teams' clients stop to rest, where they run into Beck Weathers, who agrees to descend with them. Storm clouds and thick snowfall cause the guides to lose their positions and not know where they need to go. Higher on the mountain,  Hall and Hansen watch as Scott Fischer is dragged by them, so weak he can no longer stand.

Night falls, and Krakauer is awoken in his tent by Rob's Sherpa, Angdorjee, who informs him that the storm is getting increasingly worse, and that Rob and majority of the clients have yet to return. The pair make an attempt to find them, but quickly turn back when they realize the conditions are too treacherous. Meanwhile, Rob attempts to convince Doug to stand up and continue descending, but Doug begs Rob to leave him, telling Rob he will die if he attempts to save him. Rob refuses to leave him behind, and they continue. Scott, suffering from edema, walks off the side of the mountain, and is only saved when his Sherpa pulls him back up with their connected short rope. Scott then begins to fall into unconsciousness, and Lopsang radios for help. Rob continues to struggle down with Doug. In the darkness, Rob slips and falls down, and becomes separated from a hallucinating Doug. He then watches helplessly as Doug, too far away to help, tumbles over the side to his death. Rob is then found by Andy, who attempts to help him up. Andy then leaves, telling Rob he is going to get help. Despite Rob's plea's, Andy continues to go. Andy disappears from view. Rob then hears him cry out, and crawls forward to find Andy's hat lying next to a large drop off, and assumes that Andy has fallen to his death. Rob, buried under snow, communicates with Krakauer attempting to get direction on where he can find oxygen. He gets direction, but then falls down again, and begins to moan. The oxygen bottles are then revealed to be less than twenty feet away from him, but he doesn't see them. Beidelman and Groom's group becomes hopelessly lost, and they take only the clients who can walk with them, dropping Yasuko, Beck, Sandy Pittman, and Charlotte Fox. Scott continues to drift in and out of consciousness, only muttering the words "I am invincible" to his Sherpa, before again losing consciousness. Anatoli Boukreev appears, and helps down Charlotte Fox and Pittman, but is unable to get a third client. Rob begins to hallucinate about seeing his wife Jan, but then snaps outs of it, to realize he is still stuck. He also begins to realize that his hands and his legs are getting extremely frostbitten, and he is having trouble moving. He then blacks out again.

Rob then awakens the next morning, to realize that he is still alive, but barely. He radios the camp, who put him onto the radio with his wife Jan. He asks her if Sarah would be an appropriate name for their daughter, and she agrees. They both tell each other they love them, and then Rob says goodbye to his wife. He dies shortly afterward from hypothermia. Beck Weathers then wakes up, somehow having survived being buried under the snow with no oxygen. Still blinded, he stumbles back to camp, where he receives help. Meanwhile, Anatoli climbs up, and finds the now frozen corpse of Scott Fischer. He says goodbye, and after pulling Fischer's backpack over his face, he leaves. Back at base camp the survivors reminisce about the friends that they have lost.

Huntington  Brill Archive, 1984, p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Kurkihar is situated about 5&amp;nbsp;km. north-east of Wazirgunj, and 27 km east from [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The inscriptions found suggest that Kurkihar was once a well known international pilgrimage center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhaskar.com/news/BIH-PAT-HMU-buddhist-archaeological-site-kurkihar-5620721-PHO.html ‡§ú‡§ø‡§¶ ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§ö‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä : ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ò‡§∞-‡§ò‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§∞, ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§•‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß,  Bhaskar News,  Jun 13, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include a gilded [[Avalokiteshvara]] image from 12th century, referred to as being resplendent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkativeman.com/gilt-bronze-statue-bodhisattva-avalokiteshvara/  Resplendent Sculpture of Avalokiteshvara from Kurkihar (Bihar, India) from 12th Century, January 10, 2017, Ellen Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery where the bronzes were found was named Apanakain in an [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]] manuscript now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Major Kittoe in 1847, he visited the place twice and on the second visit to the village, spent four days collecting "ten cart-loads of images; all Buddhist and the Tamrika period". A great portion of this collection is preserved in the Indian Museum Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhpromo.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=71  KURKIHAR, -The remnants of an artistic age, 10 December 2009 20:10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham visited Kurkihar in 1861-62 and again in 1879-80. He mentions that the site was about 600 feet square and about 25 feet high. He mentioned having seen here not only numerous Buddhist images, large and small, but a large number of votive stupas. He says there were in his time "row after row of Chaityas extending north to south for several hundred feet".

In 1930 a hoard of 226 bronzes and five other objects was found at Kurkihar, which were unearthed from the main mound. These included  Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Stupas, Bells and ritual objects. Today, these objects are displayed in special room in the Patna Museum.

Of the 87 images, 81 were Buddhist and 6 Brahmanical. They were all found in one spot, with the smaller images enclosed in earthen jars.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Sarasvati and K.C. Sarkar, Kurkihar, Gaya and Bodh-Gaya, Rajshahi, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; They were found about 25 feet below the surface of the main mound,  when someone was digging for bricks.

==Major images ==

The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha was sold for US$ 2,806,390 on 3 Oct 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24028/lot/16/  THE SONNERY KURKIHAR BUDDHA]&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly contemporaneous with the Atisha period in Tibet (1st half of the 11th century), which initiated a two-century period when Indian bronzes were collected by Tibetans and served as the models of  their own early styles. The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha may have been one such image that travelled to Tibet during the [[History_of_Tibet#Tibetan_Renaissance_.2810th-12th_century.29|Tibetan Renaissance]] period.

In 2005, for an exhibition in Australia, two of the three statues representing India were from Kurkihar, they were valued at US $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehindustan.com/news/Gaya/article1-Kurkihar-neglected-Buddhist-site-lies-in-increased-prized-sculptures-653651.html  ‡§â‡§™‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§≤, ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§õ‡§ø‡§™‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡§¨‡•á‡§∂‡§ï‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç, Live Hindustan, 4 ‡§ú‡§®‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
Cunningham has written: "I procured several short but interesting inscriptions at Kurkihar. The name of Sakala is mentioned in several of them, and also Kerala in Dakshinades. The age of these inscriptions, judging from the shapes of the letters, must be about A.D. 800 to 1000"&lt;ref&gt;[https://silentpagesindia.blogspot.in/2013/09/visit-to-kurkihar-in-august-2013.html   An ancient legendary site yet to be fully explored and understood, 28th September 2013, Vikas Vaibhav]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ninety three inscriptions have been found on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji-Sastri, "Ninety-three Inscriptions on the Kurkihar Bronzes,  Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, XXVI, 3 (1940), 236-251. &lt;/ref&gt; The Kurkihar inscriptions refer to Devapala (810‚Äìc.‚Äâ850), Rajyapala (908‚Äì940), Mahipala (988‚Äìc.‚Äâ1036) and Vigrahapala III (1054‚Äì1072), ranging from 9th century to 1074 AD.  The name of the monastery was apparently named Apanaka, which is mentioned in several inscriptions. The monastery was apparently very popular among the visitors from [[Kanchi]] in South India.

The names, places of origin and ranks of the donors for 9-12th century have been analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/download/100/120 The socieo-economic dimensions of dedicatory inscriptions, B.N. Prasad, JOBS.2074(7):116-152]&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution is 9th century:14, 10th: 21, 11th: 25, and 12th: 10.

==Manuscript==
A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]  now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt; was copied in this monastery during the rule of [[Ramapala]].

==Significance==

Kurkihar was apparently a major pilgrimage center located midway between [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Rajgriha]] and as well an artistic center of brass and stone sculpting. The inscriptions found  refer to donors not only from distant place in India like Sakala in Punjab, and Kerala, Conjeevaram or Kanchi in the south, but also from Bali Islands, Malaya as well as  other countries. The inscriptions  refer to a number of kings, mostly of the Pala dynasty.

==Comparison with Nalanda bronzes==
[[File:043 Buddha Teaching, Nalanda (9218609395).jpg|thumb|Buddha Teaching, [[Nalanda]] ]]

Kurkihar bronzes have been compared with the bronzes from nearby Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=nalanda+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZG8OgVa2md&amp;sig=v10TTanrXBuxy8Cs4mxUGYNck34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix87zom6bXAhXH4IMKHULFDUoQ6AEISTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=kurkihar&amp;f=false The Bronzes of Nalanda and Hindu-javanese Art, A.J. Bernet Kampers, Brill Archive, 1933, p. 19-64]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that Nalanda sculptors may have settled in Kurkihar&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xLA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=nalanda+kurkihar+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qmgax54DUI&amp;sig=de0NKi94XGa4OX_BGvrFAh_yzgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3rfWWsabXAhVi_4MKHZLEB1EQ6AEIRTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=nalanda%20kurkihar%20bronzes&amp;f=false The "P√•ala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture,Volume 10 of The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington, Brill Archive, 1984  p. 5-153]&lt;/ref&gt; Kurkihar bronzes data from 10th to 12th cent while Nalanda bronzes cover the period from 7th to 9th cent. nalanda bronzes are reddish whereas Kurkihar bronzes are more yellow.

==Museums==

Most of the Kurkihar bronzes are in the [[Patna Museum]]. The Hindu temple situated in the north-eastern portion of the village was visited by Cunningham in 1861 where a number of images, both Buddhist and Hindu images,  dated to the 10th - 11th Century AD, have been preserved here.

==Patna Museum theft==

On Sept 26, 2006, 18 bronze images from Kurkihar were stolen from the Patna Museum. The thieves entered through a window by cutting the cutting bars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/18-statues-figurines-of-pala-period-stolen-from-patna-museum/418634   18 statues, figurines of Pala period stolen from Patna museum, Outlook, Sept 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The images were later recovered from a gang  including a Vinod Yadav in Nalanda district, and Shahid Warsi of Kolkata. A [[Manjushri]] image was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6038510.stm Priceless Indian statue recovered, BBC,  10 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madonna and Child Kissing''''' is a 1520s [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by the Flemish [[renaissance]] artist [[Quentin Matsys]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-247/catalogue-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Mary, holding two cherries with her right hand, sits kissing her child who sits next to her on a pedastal inside a richly decorated throne with a view of a castle on a river beyond. In the foreground grapes (referring to the wine of the [[Eucharist]]) and an apple (symbol of the [[Fall of Man]]) lie on a banister.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; 

There are several known versions of this painting, made popular by a 1628 painting by [[Willem van Haecht]] of the ''Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]]''.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; That ''Madonna of the Cherries'' painting was the subject of an anecdote about it which was published in 1648 by Frans Fickaert (1614-1654) in which he stated that on 23 August 1615 while on a visit, the Archduke attempted to buy it from Van der Geest but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bran038biog01_01/bran038biog01_01_1382.php Metamorphosis ofte Wonderbaere Veranderingh ende Leven van den vermaerden Mr. Quinten Matsijs, Constigh Grof-smit ende Schilder binnen Antwerpen]'', t' Antwerpen by Franchoys Fickaert, onder onze Lieve Vrouwen Thoren, in den gulden Enghel, teghenover den Bornput van denselven Quintijn ghemaeckt, anno 1648, met portret van Quinten Matsijs.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed it was in the possession of Van der Geest who declined an offer to purchase it by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert of Austria]]. Recent [[dendrochronology]] has shown that the wood of the panel was felled at the latest in 1502.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Though this panel could have been ready for use by 1513, a date after 1527 is more likely.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Fickaert may have been mistaken in the year, or possibly this panel is not the original and was copied by the artist based on the story, or perhaps even because of its featured status in the Haecht painting and the enthusiasm Van der Geest had for Matsys. Van der Geest celebrated the hundredth anniversary of Matsys' death by having his bones re-interred in the Antwerp Cathedral with the inscription ''Connubial bliss turned a blacksmith into Apelles''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.garyschwartzarthistorian.nl/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/documents/LoveInTheKunstkamerTableauSummer1996.pdf Love in the Kunstkamer]'', by [[Gary Schwartz (art historian)|Gary Schwartz]], Fine Arts Magazine Tableau, Summer 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willem van Haecht W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Van Haecht painting featuring the ''Madonna of the Cherries'', with Van der Geest pointing to the Madonna and looking at the viewer and Albert and Isabella seated before it]]
This painting was in the collection of [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau|Albertina Agnes (1634-1696), Princess of Oranje-Nassau]], at the [[Stadhouderlijk Hof|Frisian Stadholder‚Äôs Court]], [[Leeuwarden]], and a century later was appropriated for the national collection from [[Paleis Het Loo]] to the museum then in [[The Hague]], 18 September 1798. The appropriation of art from the [[stadtholder]]'s collection was a tactical move to prevent the abduction of more national treasure to Paris as had happened with the [[Gallery Prince William V]] in 1795. The painting has been in the national collection owned by the Rijksmuseum ever since. Since 1948 it has been on loan to the [[Mauritshuis]].&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16779">A '''miniature book''' is a very small book. Standards for what may be termed a miniature rather than just a small book have changed through time. Today, most collectors consider a book to be miniature only if it is 3 inches or smaller in height, width, and thickness, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbs.org/|title=What is a miniature book?|last=|first=|date=|website=MIniature Book Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many collectors consider nineteenth-century and earlier books of 4 inches to fit in the category of miniatures. Book from 3-4 inches in all dimensions are termed '''macrominiature books'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/arts/design/20grim.html|title=Catching Up on a Little Light Reading|last=Grimes|first=William|date=2007-05-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books less than 1 inch in all dimensions are called '''microminiature books'''.

==History==
Miniature books stretch back far in history; many collections contain [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform tablets]] stretching back thousands of years, and exquisite medieval [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Printers began testing the limits of size not long after the technology of printing began, and around 200 miniature books were printed in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.oxy.edu/special-collections/minibooks/throughtheyears.htm|title=Miniature Books Through the Years|website=sites.oxy.edu|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exquisite specimens from the 17th century abound. In the 19th century, technological innovations in printing enabled the creation of smaller and smaller type.  Fine and popular additions alike grew in number throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/minibooks.htm|title=Miniature Books|last=|first=|date=2012-10-22|work=American Antiquarian Society|access-date=2018-04-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some miniature books are objects of high craft, bound in fine [[Morocco|Moroccan]] leather, with [[Gilding|gilt]] decoration and excellent examples of [[woodcuts]], etchings, and [[watermarks]], others are cheap, disposable, sometimes highly functional items not expected to survive. Today, miniature books are produced both as fine works of craft and as commercial products found in chain bookstores.

Some popular types of miniature books from various periods include [[Bible|Bibles]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[Bilingual dictionary|Bilingual dictionaries,]] [[Short story|short stories]], [[Poetry|verse]], famous speeches, [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], [[Guide book|travel guides]], [[Almanac|almanacs]], children's stories, and the miniaturization of well-known books such as ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'', ''[[The Art of War]]'', and [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

=== "Smallest Book in the World" ===
Many books have claim to the title of smallest book in the world at the time of their publication. The title can apply to a variety of accomplishments: smallest overall size, smallest book with [[movable type]], smallest printed book, smallest book legible to the naked eye, and so on.

750: ''Hyakumant≈ç darani'' or ‚ÄòOne Million Pagoda Dharani.' Also one of the earliest known printed texts, these 2-3/8" tall Buddhist charms were printed, rolled into a scroll, placed in miniature white pagodas, and distributed to Buddhist temples. A million were printed at the command of Japanese [[Empress Shotoku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkQdDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=oldest+buddhist+printed+million+copies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=prAWVYNX_V&amp;sig=0qYFt2ojnuJTY2-9NQP-e9U4kGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY27W61LraAhVRNd8KHXZhDkUQ6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20buddhist%20printed%20million%20copies&amp;f=false|title=The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention|last=Monro|first=Alexander|date=2017-02-21|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780307456694|location=|pages=132|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MIniature Books as charms, talismans, and amulets ===
In 2007, archaeologists found a miniature Bible (Glasgow: David Bryce &amp; Son, 1901) tucked into a child's boot hidden in a chimney cavity in an English cottage attic. Shoes were placed in such locations as early as the fourteenth-century as anti-witchcraft devices known as "spirit traps."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|title=World's Smallest Bible Found in a Boot|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|date=February 9, 2007|website=Discovery News|archive-url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|archive-date=February 17, 2007|dead-url=|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing, Printing, and Binding in Miniature ==
The creation of a miniature book requires exceptional skill in all aspects of book production, because elements such as bindings, pages, and type, illustrations, and subject matter all need to be approached with a new set of problems in mind. For instance, the pages of a miniature book do not fall open as do those of larger books, because the pages are not heavy enough. Bindings require exceptionally thin materials, and creating type that is readable and beautiful requires great skill. Many printers have created miniature books to test their own technical limits or to show off their skill. Many books have claimed the sought-after title of "smallest book in the world," which is now held by experiments in nanoprinting.

== Holdings ==
The Native American Women Playwrights Archive in the King Library's Walter Havighurst Special Collections of Miami University contains play manuscripts and other materials including audio and video recordings of performances (VHS tapes, audio cassettes, CDs, and DVDs), photographs, newspaper articles, reviews, flyers, and posters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The archive also holds administrative and financial documents, notes, forms, mailings lists, and correspondence pertaining to the management of the archive and sponsored conferences and events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other holdings include documents relating to the work of Spiderwoman Theater, such as photographs of performances, play programs, interviews, and personal accounts from the members of the theater troupe. There are also documents regarding the legal dispute with Marvel Comics over the name "Spiderwoman."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All the materials in NAWPA are open-access and available for anyone to read in the library. NAWPA continuously adds new playwrights and works to its collection. The archive encourages "playwrights at any level of development"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to submit their materials.

== Publications ==
In 2008, University of Michigan Press published ''Footpaths and Bridges: Voices from the Native American Women Playwrights Archive'', edited by Shirley A. Huston-Findley and Rebecca Howard.

'''Nea Moni''' ({{lang-el|ŒùŒ≠Œ± ŒúŒøŒΩŒÆ}}, lit. "New Monastery") is an 11th-century monastery on the island of [[Chios]] that has been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It is located on the Provateio Oros Mt. in the island's interior, about 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chios (town)|Chios town]]. It is well known for its [[mosaic]]s, which, together with those at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]] and [[Hosios Loukas]], are among the finest examples of [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|"Macedonian Renaissance" art]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/537 Monasteries of Daphni, Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni of Chios], World Heritage site&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The monastery was built in the mid-11th century, by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] and his wife, Empress [[Zoe (empress)|Zoe]]. According to tradition, it is built on the location where three monks, Nikitas, Ioannes and Iosif, miraculously found an [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], hanging from a branch of [[Myrtus|myrtle]].&lt;ref name=Church&gt;[http://www.ecclesia.gr/greek/monshrines/neamonihiou.html The Nea Moni of Chios], from the Church of Greece website&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Constantine was exiled in nearby [[Lesbos]], and the monks visited him and told of a vision according to which he would eventually become emperor. Constantine promised to build a church if this should come to pass. Indeed, in 1042, Constantine became emperor, and in gratitude began constructing the monastery, dedicated to the [[Theotokos]].&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The main church (the ''[[katholikon]]'') was inaugurated in 1049, and the complex finished in 1055, after Constantine's death.&lt;ref name=Ministry&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 The Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023090712/http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 |date=2007-10-23 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery was early on endowed with privileges: in a [[chrysobull]] of July 1049, Constantine Monomachos granted the monastery the head tax of all [[Jews]] of the island of Chios, and set the monastery apart from any superior ecclesiastic or secular hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Amnon: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSZmYFmjwlwC The Jews in the Legal Sources of the Early Middle Ages]'', pp. 160-163&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of land grants, tax exemptions and other privileges granted by successive emperors, the monastery prospered during the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Over the centuries, the monastery amassed substantial riches and became one of the wealthiest monasteries in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. At its peak, around 1300, its estates covered one third of Chios and it is estimated that up to 800 monks belonged to it.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The subsequent Genoese domination reduced its wealth, but the monastery prospered again during the Ottoman era, when it was subject directly to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and enjoyed considerable autonomy. The late 16th-century traveler [[Samuel Purchas]] recounts that it had 200 monks, and that "alone in all Greece they had the right to use bells." During the 17th century the number of monks decreased further, but recovered in the next century. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Chrysanthos Notaras, and the French priest Fourmont, who visited the monastery in 1725 and 1729 respectively, commented on the large numbers of monks, the quantity of relics preserved, and the beauty of the church and its decoration.

The monastery's decline began only after the [[Chios massacre|destruction of Chios]] by the Ottomans in 1822, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The monastery was sacked and looted, and never recovered its former glory. In 1881, an [[1881 Chios earthquake|earthquake]] added further damage to the main church, leading to the collapse of its dome, while several other buildings, like the 1512 bell-tower, were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a [[convent]]. According to the 2001 census, it is inhabited by only three nuns.

[[File:Nea Moni (plan of kafolikon).jpg|thumb|Plan of the katholikon]]

The monastery complex covers an area of approximately 17,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and consists of the katholikon, two smaller churches (dedicated to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and to [[Saint Pantaleon|St Panteleimon]]) the dining hall ("trapeza"), the monks' cells ("kelia"), the reception hall or "[[triclinium|triklinon]]" and underground water [[cistern]] ("kinsterna"). The complex is surrounded by a wall (the original Byzantine wall was destroyed in 1822), and in the northeastern corner stands a defensive tower, in earlier times used as a library.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; In addition, outside the walls, near the monks' cemetery, there is a small chapel to [[St Luke]].&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt;

The katholikon is the monastery's central structure, dedicated to the [[Dormition]] of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; It is composed of the main church, the [[narthex|esonarthex]] and the [[narthex|exonarthex]]. The main church is of an [[octagon]]al shape, the so-called "insular" type, found in Chios and Cyprus. Although all three sections date to the 11th century, the main church suffered significant damage in 1822 and 1881, with the result that its current, rebuilt, form is different from the original. The bell tower was constructed in 1900, replacing an older one built in 1512.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Originally, the remains of the three founders were kept in the exonarthex, but most of these were destroyed during the sack of 1822.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt;

Along with the katholikon, the only remaining 11th century buildings are the partially ruined tower, the chapel of St Luke, the cistern and parts of the trapeza.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The cells, most of which are in a ruined state, date to the Venetian and Genovese periods. A small museum, opened in 1992, exists to the NW of the katholikon, housed in a renovated cell. The displayed artifacts date mostly from the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 The Musemum of the Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605061209/http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 |date=2010-06-05 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre''' is a full-time [[Drama school|professional conservatory for actors]] located at 340 East 54th Street in New York City, and is known as the home of the [[Meisner technique]], developed by [[Sanford Meisner]].

==History==
[[File:Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre building on Grand Street in 1916.jpg|left|thumb|275px|The Grand Street building in 1916]]
The '''Neighborhood Playhouse''' had originally been founded as an [[off-Broadway]] theatre by philanthropists [[Alice Lewisohn]] and [[Irene Lewisohn]] in 1915, but closed in 1927. The following year, it re-opened as The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre with the addition of Rita Wallach Morgenthau. [[Sanford Meisner]] joined the faculty in 1935 from the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]]. Meisner used his study of Russian theatre and acting innovator, [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski System|System]] to develop his own technique, as an alternative to [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[Method acting]].

The Executive Director Emeritus of the Playhouse, Harold G. Baldridge, a graduate of the school himself, had been head of the school for 32 years. Pamela Moller Kareman serves as the current Executive Director, also a graduate of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

The school offers a Two Year Certificate Program, with admission to the second year dependent upon unanimous approval of the faculty. There is also a Six Week Summer Intensive.

The Neighborhood Playhouse also offers Playhouse Juniors, a popular Saturday training program for children in grades 1‚Äì12.  Children attend a fixed curriculum of singing, acting and dancing classes in a non-competitive environment.

Playwright [[Horton Foote]] met actor [[Robert Duvall]] at Neighborhood Playhouse when Duvall starred in a 1957 production of Foote's play, ''[[The Midnight Caller (play)|The Midnight Caller]]''. Foote recommended Duvall to play the part of [[List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters#Arthur .22Boo.22 Radley|Boo Radley]] in the 1962 film, ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Robert Duvall]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director) |date= April 16, 2002 |title = Miracles &amp; Mercies |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium= Documentary |publisher= [[Blue Underground]] |location= [[West Hollywood]], California |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

'''NoonTalk Media''' ({{zh|t=ÂçàË®ÄÂ™í‰Ωì|s=ÂçàË®ÄÂ™í‰Ωì|p=W«îy√°n M√©it«ê}}) is a Singapore-based media company co-founded by actor, television host and radio DJ, [[Dasmond Koh]].&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{cite web|first1=May|last1=Seah|title=Dasmond Koh, entertainment mogul and biggest loser|url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/celebrity/dasmond-koh-entertainment-mogul-and-biggest-loser|website=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=2016-10-05|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NoonTalk represents the casualness in coffeeshop banter that usually takes place during noon.Founded in 2011, NoonTalk Media was started because [[Dasmond Koh]] "wanted to help" [[Aloysius Pang]], [[Xu Bin]] and [[Kimberly Chia]] achieve their acting dreams. Seeing the passion in them while filming his directorial debut ''[[Timeless Love (film)|Timeless Love]]'' (2012) and having been in the entertainment industry for 20 years, [[Dasmond Koh]]  wanted to pass on his experience or connections he had. Shortly after , Malaysian Musician, Gavin Teo, China Actor, Zong Zijie and Singaporean Child Actor , Damien Teo joined in Noontalk during different respective years.&lt;ref name=today /&gt;

In September 2016, NoonTalk signed on 21-year-old Olympic sprinter [[Timothee Yap]] to help raise the profile of local athletes and to gain corporate as well as public support.&lt;ref name=today /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Lin Fhoong|last1=Low|title=Sprinter Timothee Yap on fast track to stardom|url=http://www.todayonline.com/sports/sprinter-timothee-yap-fast-track-stardom|website=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=2016-10-05|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noontalk Media was previously located at Leong Huat Building till 2016 and now moved to a new premise at Mapletree Building, 60 Anson Road. In 2018 , the company shifted to 10 Central Exchange Green. 

As of May 2018, Noontalk Media regret to announce that they will no longer be representing Damien Teo as his artiste management and they wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

'''''Octopussy and The Living Daylights''''' (sometimes published as '''''Octopussy''''') is the fourteenth and final [[James Bond]] book written by [[Ian Fleming]] in the [[James Bond novels|Bond series]]. The book is a collection of short stories published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 23 June 1966.

The book originally contained just two stories, "[[#"Octopussy"|Octopussy]]" and "[[#"The Living Daylights"|The Living Daylights]]", with subsequent editions also carrying firstly "[[#"The Property of a Lady"|The Property of a Lady]]" and then "[[#"007 in New York"|007 in New York]]". The stories were first published in different publications, with "Octopussy" first serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in October 1965. "The Living Daylights" had first appeared in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 4 February 1962; "The Property of a Lady" was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for the 1963 edition of their journal, ''The Ivory Hammer''; whilst "007 in New York" first appeared in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963.

The two original stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", were both adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format in the ''Daily Express'' in 1966‚Äì1967. Elements from the stories have also been used in the [[Eon Productions]] Bond films. The first, ''[[Octopussy]]'', starring [[Roger Moore]] as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and provided the [[back story]] for the film [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy's]] family, while "The Property of a Lady" was more closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', released in 1987, was the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first appearance as Bond. "007 in New York", meanwhile, provided character and plot elements for the first two films starring [[Daniel Craig]] as Bond, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]]''.

==Plots==

==="Octopussy" {{anchor|Octopussy}}===
[[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]] operative [[James Bond]], code name 007, is assigned to apprehend a hero of the [[World War II|Second World War]] implicated in a murder involving a cache of [[Nazi gold]]. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from the perspective of Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in [[Kitzb√ºhel]], Austria, after the war, found the gold with the help of a mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef ‚Äì including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' [[octopus]] that Smythe feeds and talks to.

Bond chooses not to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to contemplate his options ‚Äì suicide or a [[court martial]]. As Smythe hunts for [[Scorpaenidae|scorpion fish]] to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.

==="The Living Daylights" {{anchor|The Living Daylights}}===
An unusually morose James Bond is assigned sniper duty to help British agent 272 escape from [[East Berlin]]. Bond's duty is to safeguard his crossing into [[West Berlin]] by eliminating a top [[KGB]] [[Assassination|assassin]] codenamed "Trigger" who has been dispatched to kill him. Bond takes up a position on the western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the [[no man's land]] of broken, brightly lit ground that 272 will have to cross. On each of three nights, he sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, taking particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and realizes that it is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her rifle instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.

Afterward, Bond admits to his spotter that he did not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be considered a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that [[M (James Bond)|M]] will fire him for it.

==="The Property of a Lady" {{anchor|The Property of a Lady}}===
The Secret Service learns that Maria Freudenstein, an employee known to be a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewelry crafted by [[Peter Carl Faberg√©]] and is planning to auction it at [[Sotheby's]]. Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as ''[[persona non grata]]''.

==="007 in New York" {{anchor|007 in New York}}===
A brief tale in which Bond muses about New York City and his favourite recipe for [[scrambled eggs]], during a quick mission to the titular city to warn a female [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent. It is notable for including a rare humorous conclusion and for its mention of Solange, a young lady of Bond's intimate acquaintance who works in a shop, [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie's]], "appropriately employed in their Indoor Games Department".

==Characters and themes==
The author of the "continuation" Bond stories, [[Raymond Benson]], noted that in "The Living Daylights" Bond's thoughts on killing are examined once again, showing that although 007 did not like doing it, he considered that he must as part of his duty to complete an assignment.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=144}} Once the mission is completed, with Bond deliberately not killing the assassin, there is an attitude of complacency with Bond shrugging off his colleague's complaints about the incident.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=145}} Academic [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] sees the colleague, the officious Captain Spender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), who appeared in "[[From a View to a Kill]]".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}}

In the act of not killing the assassin, the theme of disobedience is raised in "The Living Daylights",{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=82‚Äì84}} with Bond calling what he has to do "murder" and subsequently dismissing his actions by saying "with any luck it will cost me my Double-0 number".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=84}} Raymond Benson considered "Octopussy" to be a morality tale, with greed bringing repercussions years later to the main protagonist, Dexter Smythe.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=143}}

==Background==
On the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack;&lt;ref name="Times obit (1965)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr. Ian Fleming|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=13 August 1964|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eight months later, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was published.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} The rights to Fleming's works were held by [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] (now Ian Fleming Publications) and it was decided by the company that two short stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", would be published in 1966.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=445}}

==="Octopussy"===
The story "Octopussy" was written in early 1962 at Fleming's [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The story is told in the manner of "Quantum of Solace", with Bond as catalyst for story told in flashback, rather than as a main character for action.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} The topics chosen for Fleming were familiar ground for him to cover, with hidden gold, tropical fish and the wartime exploits of commandos all coming from elements of his past.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=408}} Also from the past, or from his acquaintance, were other references used in the story and Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau was a fictional version of Fleming's [[No. 30 Commando|30 AU unit]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=409}} One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell, mother of [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]]. Fleming had previously used Blackwell's name as the guano-collecting ship in ''Dr. No'', calling it ''Blanche''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} Blackwell had given Fleming a [[coracle]] called ''Octopussy'', the name of which Fleming used for the story.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=93}} ''Octopussy'' was posthumously [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, 4‚Äì8 October 1965.{{sfn|Gilbert|2012|p=443}}

==="The Living Daylights"===
Fleming originally titled "The Living Daylights" as "Trigger Finger",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} although when it first appeared, in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' colour supplement of 4 February 1962,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}} it was under the title of "Berlin Escape".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} It was also published in the June 1962 issue of the American magazine [[Argosy (magazine)|''Argosy'']] under the same name.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} For ''The Sunday Times'', Fleming had commissioned [[Graham Sutherland]] to undertake the artwork to accompany the piece, at a cost of 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=395}} although the artwork wasn't used in the published edition.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}}

As background research to the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, secretary of the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|National Rifle Association]] at [[Bisley Camp|Bisley]] for information and to correct some of the more specialist areas of knowledge required for [[sniper]] shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by [[Pat Reid]]'s escape from [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz]] prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was [[Douglas Bader]], who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on [[Amaryllis Fleming]], Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: "Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}}

==="Property of a Lady"===
"Property of a Lady", which was written in early 1963, was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for use in their annual journal, ''The Ivory Hammer'',{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}}&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benson|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Benson|title=[[The James Bond Bedside Companion]]|year=1988|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree Ltd]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-85283-233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in November 1963 and later in ''[[Playboy]]'';{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=25}} Sotheby's chairman [[Peter Wilson (auctioneer)|Peter Wilson]] is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was so unhappy with the final piece he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=422}} Nonetheless, it was adapted as the auction sequence in the film ''[[Octopussy]]''.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;

==="007 in New York"===
In 1959 Fleming was commissioned by ''The Sunday Times'' to write a series of articles based on world cities, material for which later was collected into a book entitled ''[[Thrilling Cities]]''; whilst travelling through New York for material, Fleming wrote "007 in New York" from Bond's point of view.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=60}} "007 in New York" was originally titled "Reflections in a Carey Cadillac"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} and it contains a recipe for scrambled eggs which came from May Maxwell,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} the housekeeper to friend Ivar Bryce who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} The story was first published in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963 as "Agent 007 in New York", but was subsequently renamed as "007 in New York" for the 1964 US editions of ''Thrilling Cities''.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=381}}

==Release and reception==
''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' was published in Britain on 23 June 1966{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} by [[Jonathan Cape]] and cost 10s.6d.&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|title=New Fiction|newspaper=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|date=14 July 1966|authorlink=Anthony Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardback edition of the book contained only the two stories mentioned in the title, although when the paperbacks editions were published, "The Property of a Lady" was also included.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} Once again artist [[Richard Chopping]] provided the cover art, although his fee rose, to 350 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name="Midwinter (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Midwinter|first=Janet|title=The Man with the Golden Grudge|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1263359/The-Man-Golden-Grudge-How-illustrator-Ian-Flemings-novels-felt-conned-vast-royalties.html|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=[[Mail on Sunday]]|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in US by [[New American Library]] with illustrations from [[Paul Bacon (designer)|Paul Bacon]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} By 2002, "007 in New York" had been added to the book by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octopussy &amp; The living daylights / Ian Fleming|url=http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?dscnt=1&amp;elementId=1&amp;recIdxs=1&amp;vl(174399379UI0)=any&amp;frbrVersion=5&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1323028327575&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;tb=t&amp;indx=2&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;vl(freeText0)=%22007%20in%20new%20york%22&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;fn=search&amp;frbg=&amp;displayMode=full&amp;ct=display&amp;dum=true&amp;recIds=BLL01006731954&amp;doc=BLL01006731954&amp;tabs=moreTab&amp;fromLogin=true|work=The British Library Catalogue|publisher=[[The British Library]]|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Philip Larkin]] wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that "I am not surprised that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The critic for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that the book was "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} Writing in [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']], [[Anthony Burgess]] thought that "in their fascinated poring on ''things''...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic",&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; going on to note that "it is the mastery of the world that gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; On a personal note, Burgess added "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{main article|James Bond (comic strip)|Octopussy}}

;Comic strip adaptation (1966‚Äì1967)
Two of the short stories were adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format, which were published daily in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper and syndicated worldwide. ''The Living Daylights'' ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by [[Yaroslav Horak]]; the same pair also worked on ''Octopussy'', which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to ensure that they contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=4}} The strips were reprinted by [[Titan Books]] in 1988{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and then again in ''The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2'', published in 2011.{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2011|p=6}}

;''Octopussy'' (1983)
In 1983 [[Eon Productions]] loosely adapted elements of two of the stories, "Octopussy" and "The Property of a Lady" for the [[Octopussy|thirteenth]] film in their [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Roger Moore]] as Bond.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=151}} "Octopussy" provided the title of the film and the background for the character [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy]], the daughter of a character Bond had allowed to commit suicide, rather than face the shame of arrest and imprisonment.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}} The film also used the plot device of auctioning of a [[Faberg√© egg]] at Sotheby's from "The Property of a Lady" and, as with the story, the auction item was described as being the same "property of a lady".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}}

;''The Living Daylights'' (1987)
In 1987 Eon used the plot of "The Living Daylights", almost unchanged, for a section of their 1987 [[The Living Daylights|film of the same name]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=168}} The film starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first role as Bond, whilst the character of Trigger became that of cello player [[Kara Milovy]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=173}}

;''Casino Royale'' (2006)
In 2006 Eon used the plot of Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', for its 21st film of the same name.  However, a main character was named Solange, after the woman featured in "007 in New York."

;''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)
In 2008 Eon used the basic premise from the short story "007 in New York" as part of the film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', in which Bond warns a female intelligence employee that her boyfriend is an enemy agent.

;''Spectre'' (2015)
In ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', Hans Oberhauser, a background character in "Octopussy" is revealed to be the father of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and a former caretaker of Bond in his youth. In the film it is strongly hinted that Blofeld killed Oberhauser because he felt that Oberhauser loved Bond more than him, his own son.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
In England's [[Lake District]], [[Peter Rabbit]], his cousin [[Benjamin Bunny]], and Peter's triplet sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, spend most of their days picking on Mr. Joe McGregor and stealing vegetables from his garden. They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day, Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.

Meanwhile in [[London]], McGregor's great-nephew Thomas McGregor, an uptight, controlling workaholic, works at the toy department of [[Harrods]] department store where he waits for a promotion to associate general manager. He indifferently accepts the news about his great-uncle's death, someone he was completely unaware of, but is infuriated over losing the promotion to a lazy nephew of the managing director and is fired for losing his temper. His now-former manager encourages him to get a hobby and spend some time in the country.

When Thomas learns that his great-uncle's manor is valuable and that he's inherited it, he decides to appraise and prepare it for resale in order to start his own toy store to get even with his former employers. He kicks out Peter and his friends and begins to upgrade the security of the garden wall and gates, despite Bea's objections. When Peter and Benjamin sneak back into the garden, Thomas catches the latter and attempts to drown Benjamin in a river. His cousins rescue him; Thomas instead accidentally drops a prized set of binoculars that Bea had given him earlier, forcing him to retrieve it.

Thomas and Peter start a war with each other by setting up traps and other offensive nuisances. Thomas and Bea end up falling in love with each other, which causes Peter to become jealous and wanting to separate them more. This all culminates when Peter rewires an electric fence set up by Thomas, prompting Thomas to throw dynamite at Peter's burrow. Thomas then attacks Peter in the garden, telling Peter that his antics caused him to become aggressive. When Peter detonates the dynamite to prove to Bea that Thomas was using it, he ends up knocking down the tree on top of the burrow, which crushes Bea's art studio. Bea, ignoring Thomas‚Äôs explanation of his quarrel with the rabbits, breaks up with him, and he goes back to London to work at Harrods again.

Peter feels bad for what he has done, and upon learning that Bea intends to leave the neighborhood, he and Benjamin head to London to find Thomas at Harrods. Tricking Thomas into believing he was imagining the rabbits‚Äô ability to communicate, Peter apologizes for his part of the conflict and convinces Thomas to follow his heart. They rush back to the country, where Peter shows Bea the detonator and presses it for her to see, confirming Thomas‚Äôs previous claims that the rabbits were responsible for the explosion. Peter and Thomas apologize and convince Bea not to leave her home.

Wishing to remain with Bea, Thomas no longer wants to sell the manor but discovers that an unpleasant wealthy couple had already bought the house and finalized the sale. Peter and his friends use their tricks to force the couple out of the house, allowing Thomas to move back in. Thomas and Bea resume their relationship, and he permits the wildlife to freely take food from the garden as long as it's within reason. Peter and his family restore the burrow with Bea and Thomas‚Äôs help. Thomas sets up his own toy shop in the village, where Bea showcases her illustrations of the rabbits.

===Trailer criticism===
The first trailer received negative feedback from critics and fans of the character, many of whom labelled the film as being too modern and insulting to Beatrix Potter's works. [[Collider (website)|Collider]] called the trailer "garbage" and a "low brow 'comedy' cringe fest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Trombore|title=First ‚ÄòPeter Rabbit‚Äô Trailer Gives Us Another Reason to Be Mad at James Corden|url=http://collider.com/peter-rabbit-trailer|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=Complex Media|date=September 21, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Heritage from ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that "the ''Peter Rabbit'' film looks like the result of some blisteringly inept manhandling [...] there's something genuinely harrowing about the sight of ''Peter Rabbit'' ‚Äì gentle, Edwardian Peter Rabbit ‚Äì thoughtlessly injuring some birds, or grabbing a pile of lettuce leaves and making it rain like a banker in a strip club, or literally twerking" and argued "there is no way on Earth that [Beatrix Potter would] have ever given the green light to a slow motion car crash like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Heritage|title=James Corden's Peter Rabbit: another kids' classic wrecked forever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/25/peter-rabbit-film-trailer-beatrix-potter-james-corden|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer James Baldock found that the trailer was "so gut wrenchingly bad" and that "if the movie lives up to its two minute preview ‚Äì [it] is set to be the greatest abomination to grace the big screen since ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''." He finished by writing "Listen carefully, and you can just about hear the sound of Beatrix Potter, turning furiously in her grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Baldock|title=Here‚Äôs the trailer for the new Peter Rabbit movie ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a total disaster|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/25/heres-the-trailer-for-the-new-peter-rabbit-movie-and-its-a-total-disaster-6954943/|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, a new trailer for the United Kingdom was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katharine|last=Cowdrey|title=Sony launches trailer for upcoming Peter Rabbit film|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/sony-launches-trailer-upcoming-peter-rabbit-film-669466|website=[[The Bookseller]]|publisher=Bookseller Media|location=London, England|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the first week after the film's release, groups in multiple countries criticized it for "allergy bullying" and called for an apology from Sony. The accusations focused on a scene where Thomas McGregor ‚Äî whose character has a known severe allergy to [[blackberries]] ‚Äî is pelted with the berries until one enters his mouth, causing him to enter [[anaphylactic shock]] and grab for his [[Epipen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/11/peter-rabbit-film-criticised-for-depicting-allergy-bullying |title=Peter Rabbit film criticised for depicting allergy bullying |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=February 11, 2018 |author=Guardian staff|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-11/peter-rabbit-calls-sony-pictures-apologise-food-allergy-scene/9420102 |title=Peter Rabbit: Calls for Sony Pictures to apologise after food allergy bullying scene in new movie |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|first1=Edwina|last1=Seselja|first2=Samantha|last2=Dawes|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/11/peter-rabbit-film-accused-food-bullying-rabbits-pelt-allergic|title=Peter Rabbit film accused of food bullying as rabbits pelt allergic man with blackberries |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=February 11, 2018 |last=Ward |first=Victoria|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Sony published a statement saying "We sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue, and we truly apologize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43027764|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Peter Rabbit film producers apologise over allergy scene|date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[File:Milton preface.jpg|thumb|Preface to the poem ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' by William Blake]]
A '''preface''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|p|r|…õ|f|·µª|s}}) or '''proem''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|p|r|o ä|…õ|m}}) is an introduction to a [[book]] or other [[literature|literary]] work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a ''[[foreword]]'' and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work.

A preface generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or how the idea for the book was developed; this is often followed by thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.

A preface is usually signed (and the date and place of writing often follow the typeset signature); a foreword by another person is always signed. Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an "Introduction" that may be paginated with [[Arabic numerals]], rather than in the preface. The term ''preface'' can also mean any preliminary or introductory statement. It is sometimes abbreviated ''pref''.

Preface comes from the [[Latin]], meaning either "spoken before" (''prae'' and ''fatia'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preface | title=preface | website=Dictionary.com | accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpraefatio | title=praefƒÅtƒ≠o | accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "made before" (''prae'' + ''factum''). While the former source of the word could have preface meaning the same as [[prologue]], the latter strongly implies an introduction written before the body of the book. With this meaning of stated intention, British publishing up to at least the middle of the twentieth century distinguished between preface and introduction.

'''Skull-A-Day''' is an ongoing online art project/blog created by artist [[Noah Scalin]]. For its first year the site consisted of daily skull art creations made by Noah as well as weekly submissions by fans of the project. After Noah finished his project, he has continued to post daily images of skulls created by fans to the site.

==History==
On June 4, 2007, [[Noah Scalin]] posted an orange paper cutout of a skull online with the note, ‚ÄúI am making a skull a day for a year‚Äù. Within weeks the site gained international recognition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecrans.fr/Le-site-du-jour-Tetes-de-mort.html Le site du jour : T√™tes de mort]. Ecrans.fr. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  and began attracting a dedicated audience who participated in the project by submitting skull sightings (which were posted weekly) as well as taking part in skull themed contests. 

Noah made skulls out of a wide range of materials and techniques, rarely repeating one. The skulls generally took 2‚Äì4 hours a day to make and photograph, though several took much longer. Many times the finished pieces were offered as free downloads to the community including two original fonts (Skullphabet 1 &amp; 2), a papercraft model skull, a paint-by-numbers, a crossword puzzle, and several stencils all of which are Creative Commons licensed. 

On June 2, 2008, Noah made his official last skull No. 365, though an additional skull labeled #365.25 was posted the day after since 2008 was a leap year.  On June 3, 2008 the site was dubbed Skull-A-Day 2.0 and Noah began posting original skull art submissions from readers of the site daily.  

On October 6, 2008, the book ''Skulls'', based on the Skull-A-Day project, was released by Lark Books an imprint of [[Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161229152835/http://www.larkbooks.com/article/noah-scalin Lark Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Skulls'' features 150 of the Skull-A-Day images, including 4 DIY projects, there is also a small selection of skulls made by fans of the project using stencils created by Noah.

On June 3, 2009 the site entered its 3rd year and became Skull-A-Day 3.0.  Two new editors, Citizen Agent and Tatman, were added to the staff.  In addition to the regular daily posting of reader submissions each editor also added his own weekly new skull creation. "C-Rations" appeared every Monday and "Tuesdays With Tatman" appeared every Tuesday for the duration of the 3.0 year. 

On June 3, 2010 the site entered a 4th year and became Skull-A-Day 4.0. An additional editor, Azurafae, was added to the staff. Along with the regular daily postings are also weekly skulls made by this editor. "Dia de la Abby" appears every Thursday for the duration of the 4.0 year. Tutorials for these weekly skulls are available on her blog, Crafty Lady Abby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftyladyabby.blogspot.com/search/label/skull%20a%20day%204.0 Crafty Lady Abby ‚Äì Skull-A-Day Dia de la Abby Tutorials]. Craftyladyabby.blogspot.com. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the start of the 5th year, June 4, 2011 has been designated by the editors of the site to be the first annual international [[Skull Appreciation Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skulladay.blogspot.com/2010/06/skull-appreciation-day.html Skull Appreciation Day]. Skulladay.blogspot.com (2010-06-04). Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the end of the original project images from Skull-A-Day have been exhibited in galleries and Noah continues to give talks on the project to businesses and universities.

'''''Sleep and his Half-brother Death''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]] completed in 1874.&lt;ref name="johnwilliamwaterhouse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/sleep-half-brother-death-1874/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909160319/http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/sleep-half-brother-death-1874|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 September 2009|title=Sleep and his Half-brother Death|publisher=johnwilliamwaterhouse.com|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypnos and Thanatos==
The painting itself is a reference to the Greek gods [[Hypnos]] (sleep) and [[Thanatos]] (death) who, in the [[Greek mythology]], were brothers. Despite their similar poses in the painting, the character in the foreground is bathed in light, while his brother is shrouded in darkness; the first therefore represents Sleep, the latter Death.&lt;ref name="Kryger2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kryger|first=Meir H. |title=Atlas of Clinical Sleep Medicine: Expert Consult - Online|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bLVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-28917-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The personification of Sleep clasps poppies, symbolic of narcosis and dreamlike-states.&lt;ref name="KrahnSilber2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krahn|first1=Lois E.|last2=Silber|first2=Michael H.|last3=Morgenthaler|first3=Timothy I.|title=Atlas of Sleep Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaLSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date= 2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-84184-763-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sopo Archangels'''  (Arc√°ngeles de Sop√≥) is a famous collection of oil paintings from the [[Colombia]]n [[Spanish Empire|colonial period]] which is located in the Church of the Divine Savior in the Colombian municipality of [[Sop√≥]].

This [[art collection]]  has an important historic value.  The [[Archangel]]s  are believed to be  painted around 1650, but the artist remains unknown.  Some art experts believe that the paintings are from Baltasar de Figueroa, others point to the [[Ecuador]]ian  painter Miguel de Santiago. A third theory indicates the [[Bogot√°|Bogota]]n painter Bernabe de Posadas.  

The national Ministry of Culture and the Board of Colonial Art developed a restoration program for the pieces, which have various degrees of damage. Twelve canvas of 2.38 x 1.67 meters depict eleven archangels, plus the [[Guardian Angel]]. Each piece contains the [[Hebraic]] name of the angel and the Spanish language description:

In the letters to the [[Seven churches of Asia|early Christian churches]] of [[Smyrna]] and [[Ala≈üehir|Philadelphia]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|2:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|3:9|NKJV}}, reference is made to a '''synagogue of Satan''' ({{lang-gr|œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ£Œ±œÑŒ±ŒΩ·æ∂}}, ''synagoge tou satana''), in each case referring to a group [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament|persecuting]] the church "who say they are [[Jews]] and are not". In [[Revelation 2]], the Smyrna church is advised not to fear the events they are about to suffer; in [[Revelation 3]], the Philadelphia church is promised that the persecutors will "come and worship before [their] feet, and ... know that I have loved you".

The phrase is also used in a fragment of a [[lost work]] on [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus I of Alexandria]] found at the [[Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great]] in 1923 and identified by American theologian [[William Hatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, W., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1507736.pdf A Fragment of a Lost Work on Dioscorus], ''Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1926), pp. 377-381&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch believes the term refers to the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which Dioscorus attended in 451 and from which he was deposed and exiled for his [[monophysite]] [[Christology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9094">'''The Caribbean Artists Movement''' ('''CAM''') was an influential cultural initiative, begun in [[London]], [[England]], in 1966 and active until about 1972,&lt;ref name=Juang&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wFrAOqfhuGYC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=%22caribbean+artists+movement%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LupAA91dwy&amp;sig=Rkd_xKytEaqItthrBUY2V_1CuLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8AWzUu3cCdCVhQeAm4CwBA&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caribbean%20artists%20movement%22&amp;f=false "Caribbean Artists Movement"], in Richard M. Juang and Noelle Morrissette (eds), ''Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', Vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, 2008, pp. 234-35.&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the works being produced by Caribbean writers, visual artists, poets, dramatists, film makers, actors and musicians. The key people involved in setting up CAM were [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]], [[John La Rose]] and [[Andrew Salkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/node/7 "John La Rose"], GPI website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Ho, [http://www.postcolonialweb.org/caribbean/trinidad/ho2.html "The Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) and the Trinidad February Revolution of 1970"], Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt; As Angela Cobbinah has written, "the movement had an enormous impact on Caribbean arts in Britain. In its intense five-year existence it set the dominant artistic trends, at the same time forging a bridge between West Indian migrants and those who came to be known as black Britons."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Cobbinah, [http://www.thecnj.com/review/2007/102507/feat102507_01.html "A Caribbean hothouse for the arts in a cold climate"], ''Camden New Journal Review'', 25 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1968, Brathwaite wrote about CAM's origins, dating them back to a small informal meeting held on 19 December 1966 in his London flat in [[Mecklenburgh Square]]&lt;ref name=LouisJames /&gt; (although [[Louis James]] suggests that the "seed ideas of what was to become CAM were germinating in Brathwaite's activities at [[University of the West Indies, Mona|Mona]] in the previous decade"):&lt;ref&gt;James (2003), "The Caribbean Artists Movement", p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What was to become the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) started in December 1966 in my [[Bloomsbury]] basement flat. I had recently arrived from the Caribbean on study leave to Britain, and as a writer myself, wanted, quite naturally, to get in touch with as many Caribbean artists as possible. But where were they? The novelists‚Äô books were being regularly published; at the Commonwealth Arts Festival I had seen work by a few painters, designers and sculptors from the Caribbean; but no one seemed to know how to get in touch with them. In addition it seemed to me that our West Indian artists were not participating significantly in the cultural life of the country that had become their home.

Since 1950, nearly every West Indian novelist worth the name had come to London and more than a hundred books had come from their typewriters and pens. But despite this, the British public didn‚Äôt seem to be very much aware of the nature and value of this contribution.

...This situation, it seemed to me, was something to be deplored. The isolation of West Indian writers from each other and from the society in which they lived could eventually only stultify development and could do nothing to contribute to perhaps the most important problem of our times ‚Äì the problem of the future of race relations in Britain."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Brathwaite, "The Caribbean Artists Movement", in ''Caribbean Quarterly'', Vol. 14, No. 1/2, A Survey of the Arts (March - June 1968), pp. 57-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[BBC]] programme ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', to which Brathwaite was also a contributor, is considered a precursor of CAM.&lt;ref name=Juang /&gt;

The journal ''[[Savacou]]'' was started as a platform for CAM, connecting its activities in Britain, the Caribbean region and the [[African diaspora]], and elsewhere internationally. La Rose began selling and publishing books, under the name [[New Beacon Books]], because of the demand for material that was stimulated by the formation of CAM.

Other notable artists and intellectuals associated with CAM include [[C. L. R. James]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Wilson Harris]], [[Kenneth Ramchand]], [[Ronald Moody]], [[Aubrey Williams]], [[Gordon Rohlehr]], [[Christopher Laird]], Louis James, [[Orlando Patterson]], [[Ivan Van Sertima]], [[Althea McNish]], [[Donald Hinds]], [[James Berry (poet)|James Berry]], [[Errol Lloyd]] and [[Anne Walmsley]]. [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] is among a younger generation of Caribbean writers to have been inspired by CAM during the early '70s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ashleyjdawson.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/linton-kwesi-johnsons-dub-poetry.pdf "Linton Kwesi Johnson‚Äôs Dub Poetry and the Political Aesthetics of Carnival in Britain".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Courtman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VfdpdZ9DwH0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=%22caribbean+artists+movement%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8IYs5hE3P&amp;sig=YiszZZqBVO__5ZgNtJ5kmnsWIm4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8AWzUu3cCdCVhQeAm4CwBA&amp;ved=0CIwBEOgBMBM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caribbean%20artists%20movement%22&amp;f=false "Caribbean Artists' Movement"], in [[Alison Donnell]] (ed.), ''Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture'', Routledge, 2002, p. 64‚Äì65.&lt;/ref&gt; Walmsley has written a comprehensive appraisal of the movement in ''The Caribbean Artists Movement, 1966-1972: A Literary and Cultural History'' (1992), published by New Beacon Books.

CAM is acknowledged as being particularly significant in helping to "spark interest in the work of Britain's artists of color".&lt;ref&gt;Mora J.

'''Verisimilitude''' {{IPAc-en|Àå|v|…õr|…™|s|…™|Àà|m|…™|l|…™|tj|uÀê|d}} is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a [[fiction|work of fiction]]. The word comes from {{lang-la|verum}} meaning truth and ''similis'' meaning similar.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Language philosopher [[Stephen Neale|Steve Neale]] distinguishes between two types: '''cultural verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and '''generic verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own [[list of fictional genres|genre]] (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the [[fictional universe]] of a [[musical theatre|musical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stuart |title=Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices |location=London |publisher=Sage in association with the Open University |year=1997 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAqycFD4PBsC |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original roots==

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of [[mimesis]], the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], it must have grounding in reality.

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the [[Middle Ages]] particularly in Italian [[heroic poetry]]. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, [[decorum]]: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Teskey |chapter=Renaissance Theory and Criticism |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |edition=Second |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness [[Suspension of disbelief|to suspend his/her disbelief]], a phrase used originally by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Ashley |title=What Makes a Good Novel |journal=The English Journal |volume=60 |issue=5 |year=1971 |pages=596‚Äì598 |jstor=813069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.

==Continued evolution==

The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist [[Pierre Nicolas Desmolets]]' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own [[internal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Sparshott |title=Truth in Fiction |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1967 |pages=3‚Äì7 |jstor=429239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ewlyn F. |last=Sterling |title=The Theory of Verisimilitude in the French Novel prior to 1830 |journal=The French Review |volume=40 |issue=5 |year=1967 |pages=613‚Äì619 |jstor=384665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern perspective==

During the rise of the [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.

The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mas'Ud |last=Zavarzadeh |title=The Semiotics of the Foreseen: Modes of Narrative in (Contemporary) Fiction |journal=Poetics Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=432‚Äì433 |jstor=1771956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual markers of marital status''', as well as [[social]] status, may include [[clothing]], [[hairstyle]], accessories, [[jewelry]], [[tattoo]]s and other bodily adornments. Visual markers of [[marital status]] are particularly important because they indicate that a person should not be approached for [[flirt]]ation, [[courtship]], or [[sex]]. In some cultures, married people enjoy special privileges or are addressed differently by members of the community.

Marital status markers are usually [[gender]]-specific.

==Husband==
Male marital status markers are usually less elaborate than female marital status markers. In  many cultures they may not exist.

===Jewelery===
In many Western nations, some husbands wear a [[wedding ring]] on the third or fourth finger of the left hand. In parts of [[Europe]], especially in German-speaking regions, as well as in [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], and [[Ukraine]], the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand. In the [[Netherlands]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] wear their wedding rings on the left hand, while most other people wear them on the right. Some spouses choose to wear their wedding ring on the left hand in [[Turkey]].

In [[China]], Western influence has resulted in some husbands donning wedding rings. Traditionally, Chinese men did not wear rings and were expected to have several [[concubine|concubines]]. A ring symbolizing marriage to only one spouse was not considered necessary.&lt;ref name="f_100620"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/8017081.html|title=Chinese men find wedding rings cumbersome?|author=F_100620|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernly the material of wedding rings is not strictly prescribed; they may be forged of [[gold]], [[rose gold]], [[white gold]], [[sterling silver|argentium silver]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[titanium]], or [[tungsten carbide]].

Manual labourers sometimes wear rings of inexpensive or more durable materials like [[tungsten]] while working or bear an ink [[tattoo]] to avoid damaging a ring of precious metal or personal injury.

===Beard===
Among the [[Amish]], [[Castellani (people)|Castellani]], and [[Hutterite]] communities of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], only [[married]] [[men]] are permitted to wear a [[beard]]. Unmarried men are required to [[shaving|shave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kraybill| first = Donald| title = The Riddle of Amish Culture| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2001| isbn =0-8018-6772-X| page =68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hostetler| first = John| title = Hutterite Society| publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 1997| isbn =0-8018-5639-6| page =174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallit===
In some [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish]] communities, men wear a prayer shawl, denominated a "[[tallit]]" or "tallis", only upon marriage. It is customary for the father of the bride to present the groom with a [[tallit]] as a wedding present. In other Jewish communities, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic, all males wear the tallis, but only husbands wear it over their heads.

==Wife==

===Jewellery===
* [[Engagement ring]]: In many Western cultures, a proposal of marriage is traditionally accompanied by the gift of a ring. The man proposes and offers the ring; if the woman accepts this proposal of marriage, she will wear the ring, showing she is no longer available for courtship. In British-American tradition,  [[diamond]] rings are the most popular type of engagement ring. The engagement ring is usually worn on the left ring finger (sometimes this ring is switched from [[Ring finger#Left or right hand|the right to the left hand]] as part of the wedding ceremony). 
* [[Wedding ring]]: Many Western wedding ceremonies include the exchange of a wedding ring or rings. A common custom is for the groom to place a ring on the bride's finger and say, "With this ring I thee wed." Sometimes both bride and groom present each other with rings and repeat either these or similar words.  After the ceremony, the rings are worn throughout the marriage. In the event of divorce, the couple usually removes their rings; but some widows continue to wear their wedding ring, sometimes switching it to the left hand, while others do not. In Jewish tradition, the wedding ring must be a plain band, without gemstones. China has acquired the custom of wedding rings as late as the era of post-Cultural Revolution economic reforms, when rings were affordable and Western influence was allowed in.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-02/11/c_13171976.htm|title=Sealed with ring at Chinese weddings|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adopted habit, there are variations on how rings are used, if at all, and when. Some women wear the wedding ring on the left hand, men on the right (representing [[yin and yang]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leonmege.com/index.php/rules-of-engagement/resources/right-or-left|title=Right Hand or Left Hand?|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men wear the ring on the right hand.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"/&gt; {{Clarify|date=June 2015}} Many Chinese put the ring away to protect it, except for important holidays, such as anniversaries.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"/&gt; In Chinese tradition, higher status for men was signified by having several young female partners or concubines. A ring denies that status. For this reason, many modern Chinese men do not wear a wedding ring. Diamonds and two-partner wedding rings are advertised in modern China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nipic.com/show/4/79/7f01e48287204bfa.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nipic.com/show/4/137/5532495kc0b81af3.html|title=Áè†ÂÆùÈíªÁü≥ÂπøÂëäÊ∫êÊñá‰ª∂__Êµ∑Êä•ËÆæËÆ°_ÂπøÂëäËÆæËÆ°_Ê∫êÊñá‰ª∂ÂõæÂ∫ì_ÊòµÂõæÁΩënipic.com|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese, despite American occupation in the 1950s, only acquired a culture for wedding and engagement rings in the 1960s. In 1959, the importing of diamonds was allowed. In 1967 a U.S. advertising agency created a marketing campaign on behalf of the De Beers diamonds. The campaign equated rings with other symbols of Western culture. The campaign resulted in a sharp increase in demand: From 5% in 1967, to 27% in 1972, to 50% in 1978, to 60% in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/diamond.htm|title=Diamonds, De Beers, CSO|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mangalsutra]]: In many Hindu wedding ceremonies, the groom gives the bride a gold pendant or necklace incorporating black beads or black string. This is called a "mangal-sutra". It not only proclaims a woman's marriage, but it is believed by many to exercise a protective influence over the husband. That is, a wife's love and concern, as shown by her donning of the mangal-sutra, is magically helpful to the husband. This resembles the [[karwa-chauth]] celebration, in which a wife fasts and prays for her husband's welfare.
* [[Bangle|Bangles]]: [[Hindu]] wives also wear bangles of either white ("sankha") and/or red colour ("pala") on both hands, and do not remove them until they are single. Often made of glass, they are broken when the marriage ends. [[Bollywood]] uses this to great dramatic effect in [[Hindi]] films, with a woman being informed of the demise of her husband by the messenger, often her son, smashing her glass bangles and wiping the [[sindoor]] off her forehead. Bangles made of gold, silver, or other materials are also worn by middle class wives. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The concept of mourning jewelry, which is colored black, is becoming an accepted, visible custom for widows and widowers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Usually a black wedding band is worn on the third finger of the left hand. Usually the ring is a black wedding band, but black eternity bands and black solitaires are also worn. Such jewelry is denominated a "widow's ring" and the mourning ring is added to the marriage ring(s) and worn for the duration of the mourning period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Headwear===
In [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition, a wife is expected to cover her head when she enters a synagogue. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities, women wear head coverings at all times outside of her home, but they sometimes only cover part of her hair, similar to a hat. In some [[Hasidic]] communities, women shave their heads after their weddings and wear close fitting black scarves. The kind of head covering may be determined by local custom or personal preference. Some communities permit her hair to be visible, but in others no strand is left uncovered. Hats, headscarves, snoods, wigs, or a combination thereof are used. [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] wives wear a special hat similar to a circlet that is denominated a "Alynda≈ày".

===Hairstyle===
* [[Hairstyle#Marital status|Hairstyle indicating marital status]]
* [[Zuni people|Zuni]] hair styles

===Cosmetics===
* [[Sindoor]], a red powder (vermilion), is put on [[Hindu]] wives' foreheads to indicate their marital status.

===Clothes===
* [[Hindu]] widows wear white. (See [[White clothing (religious)]])
* Tibetan wives wear aprons.
* In western and northern [[Europe]], it was previously common for widows to wear black, at least until the first anniversary of the death of their husbands, and some still practice this custom.{{when|date=December 2015}}
