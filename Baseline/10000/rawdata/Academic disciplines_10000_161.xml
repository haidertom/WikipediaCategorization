The '''Amazon Tall Tower Observatory''' or '''ATTO''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Observatório de Torre Alta da Amazônia'') is a scientific research facility in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. It contains three research tower, one with a height of {{convert|325|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="Brazil builds"&gt;{{cite news

They are equipped with a broad range of instruments to measure chemicals and physical properties of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], such as [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations, [[aerosol]]s and meteorological data. The observatory also contains lab containers, a base camp and several near-by field sites to study soil and forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreae et. al.|first2=|date=2015-09-28|title=The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO): overview of pilot measurements on ecosystem ecology, meteorology, trace gases, and aerosols|url=https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/10723/2015/acp-15-10723-2015.html|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|language=English|volume=15|issue=18|pages=10723–10776|doi=10.5194/acp-15-10723-2015|issn=1680-7316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The observatory is a joint project between Germany and Brazil coordinated by the [[Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry]] on the German side and the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, [[National Institute of Amazonian Research|INPA]] (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia) on the Brazilian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.attoproject.org/contact/|title=ATTO - Amazon Tall Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|work=ATTO - Amazon Tall Tower Observatory|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major research partners include the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]] and the [[Amazonas State University|University of the State of Amazonas]], UEA (Universidade do Estado do Amazonas), with over 20 research institutes and universities in Brazil, Germany and other countries participating. The initial building cost of 8.4 million Euros was shared about equally by the German and Brazil partners.&lt;ref name="ATTO Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpic.de/en/research/collaborative-projects/atto/factsheet-atto.html|title=Factsheet ATTO|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is distant from any human presence, about 150 kilometres northeast of [[Manaus]], "far from disturbances caused by human influences."&lt;ref name="ATTO Factsheet" /&gt; The towers are used to study the atmosphere and its interactions with the largely untouched rainforest and soil below. It measures greenhouse gases, aerosols and weather data and provides information about a roughly 100 square kilometer area around the tower.

The joint project is dedicated to the exploration of the rainforest [[biosphere]] and how it responds to [[global warming]]. According to  the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research ([[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|BMBF]]), ATTO allows to reach new levels of measurements regarding the greenhouse gases and the complex interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the measuring tower will contribute to gather and assess “climate-relevant chemical and physical processes over the Amazon” and thus create new principles for climate protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fona.de/en/tallest-measurement-tower-opened-in-brazil-20354.html|title=Tallest Measurement Tower opened in Brazil - FONA|website=Forschung für Nachhaltige Entwicklung (FONA)|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/News/GlobalTallNews/tabid/4810/Article/2871/language/en-US/view.aspx|title=Amazon Tall Tower Observatory Completes in Rainforest Near Manaus|last=|first=|date=18 May 2015|work=CTBUH Global News|access-date=22 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATTO's counterpart “ZOTTO” ([[Zotino Tall Tower Observation Facility]]) is located in the [[Siberia]]n Taiga.

'''''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament''''' edited by [[James B. Pritchard]] (1st ed. 1950, 2nd ed.1955, 3rd ed. 1969}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Near Eastern texts relating to the Old Testament. Edited by James B. Pritchard.

In spite of the name, the included texts have broad coverage and do not necessarily relate to the [[Old Testament]]. [[William Wolfgang Hallo|William W. Hallo]], writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'' in 1970, described it as "a modern classic ever since its first appearance in 1950", because "for the first time it assembled some of the most significant Ancient Near Eastern texts in authoritative, generously annotated English translations based on the accumulated insight of several generations of scholarship scattered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William W. |last=Hallo|publisher=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|title=Review: The Ancient Near East Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament Consisting of Supplementary Materials for The Ancient Near East In Pictures and Ancient Near Eastern Texts by James B.

An abridgement of ANET and ANEP was published in a single volume in 1958 as ''"The Ancient Near East, Volume I: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures"'' with a 2nd edition published in 1965. A second anthology of supplementary material was published in 1975 as ''"Ancient Near East, Volume 2: A New Anthology of Texts and Pictures".''&lt;ref&gt;"''The Ancient Near East Volume II, A New Anthology of Texts and Pictures"'', p. v, Ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a number of '''archaeological sub-disciplines''' typically characterised by a focus on a specific method or type of material, geographical or chronological focus, or other thematic concern.

==By civilization==
Certain civilizations have attracted so much attention that their study has been specifically named. These sub-disciplines include ''[[Assyriology]]'' ([[Mesopotamia]]), ''[[Classical archaeology]]'' ([[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]), ''[[Etruscology]]'' ([[Etruria]]), and ''[[Egyptology]]'' ([[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).

==By historicity==
Another main division of archaeology distinguishes:

* ''[[historical archaeology]]'', which examines civilizations that left behind written records; and 
* ''[[prehistoric archaeology]]'', which concerns itself with societies that did not have [[writing systems]]. However, the term is generally valid only in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] where literate societies emerged without colonial influence. In areas where literacy arrived relatively late, it is more convenient to use other terms to divide up the archaeological record.

In areas of semi-literacy the term
*''[[protohistoric archaeology]]'' can be adopted to cover the study of societies with very limited written records. One example of a protohistoric site is [[Fort Ross]] on the northern [[California]] coast, which included settlements of literate [[Russia]]ns and non-literate [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives|Alaska natives]].
*''[[Ethnoarchaeology]]'' is the study of modern societies resembling extinct ones of archaeological interest, for archaeological purposes. It is often difficult to infer solid conclusions about the structure and values of ancient societies from their material remains, not only because objects are mute and say little about those who crafted and used them, but also because not all objects survive to be uncovered by scholars of a later age. Ethnoarchaeology seeks to determine, for instance, what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in [[midden]]s or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.
*''[[Taphonomy]]'' is the study of how objects decay and degrade over time. This information is critical to the interpretation of [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and other objects, so that the work of ancient people can be differentiated from the later work of living creatures and elemental forces.

==By time period==
A selective list of sub-disciplines distinguished by time-period or region of study might include:

*[[African archaeology]], [[Archaeology of the Americas]], [[Australian archaeology]], [[European archaeology]]: focuses on archaeologic study concerning the location of the findings. 
*[[Industrial archaeology]] focuses on the preservation of material relics of the [[Industrial Revolution]] or the archaeology of work.
*[[Near Eastern archaeology]] (sometimes known as Middle Eastern archaeology). See also [[Biblical archaeology]], which applies the results of Near Eastern archaeology to the study of the [[Bible]].
*[[Medieval archaeology]] is the study of post-Roman European archaeology until the sixteenth century.
*[[Post-medieval archaeology]] is the study of material culture in Europe from the 16th century onwards.
*[[Contemporary archaeology|Modern archaeology]] is the study of modern society using archaeological methods, e.g. the [[Tucson Garbage Project]].
*[[Historical archaeology]] is the study of the past using both material evidence (i.e. artifacts and their contexts) and documentary evidence (including maps, photographs and film). Usually this is associated with the Americas.
*[[Classical archaeology]] is the study of the past using both material evidence (i.e. artifacts and their contexts) and documentary evidence (including maps, literature of the time, other primary sources, etc.). Classical archaeology specifically pertains to the Mediterranean area and the archaeology of Greece and its surrounding areas.

==Other sub-disciplines==
The following is a list of other sub-disciplines. Some of these are not areas of study in their own right, and are only methods to be used in larger projects.

*[[Aerial archaeology]] - studying sites from air photos, especially by identifying [[cropmarks]]
* [[Anthracology]], the study of charcoal remains&lt;ref&gt;

*[[Archaeoastronomy]] - the study of the relationship between the configuration of ancient monuments and astronomy
*[[Archaeological science]] or Archaeometry - the application of scientific techniques or methodologies to archaeology such as [[radiocarbon dating]], [[statistics]] and [[remote sensing]]
*[[Archaeozoology]] - the study of animal remains in human settlements
*[[Archaeobotany]] or [[paleoethnobotany]] - the study of human-plant interaction in the archaeological record
*[[Battlefield archaeology]] - the study of conflict sites from an archeological perspective
*[[Calceology]] - the study of archaeological [[footwear]]
*[[Computational archaeology]] - the application of computers, particularly [[Geographic information system|GIS]], to archaeology
*[[Experimental archaeology]] involves attempting to re-enact past processes to test theories about ancient manufacturing, engineering and the effects of time on sites and objects (for example: [[flintknapping]])
*[[Environmental archaeology]] studies the long-term relationship between humans and their environments

An '''Arctic–alpine''' [[taxon]] is one whose natural [[range (biology)|distribution]] includes the [[Arctic]] and more southerly mountain ranges, particularly the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jan Christian Habel, Thorsten Assmann |year=2009 |title=Relict Species: Phylogeography and Conservation Biology |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=9783540921608 |author1=Thomas Schmitt, Christoph Muster  |author2=Peter Schönswetter |chapter=Are disjunct alpine and arctic–alpine animal and plant species in the Western Palearctic really "relics of a cold past"? |pages=239–252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMTCbd_7qWUC&amp;pg=PA245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of identical or similar taxa in both the [[tundra]] of the far north, and high [[mountain range]]s much further south is testament to the similar environmental conditions found in the two locations. Arctic–alpine plants, for instance, must be [[adaptation|adapted]] to the low temperatures, extremes of temperature, strong winds and short growing season; they are therefore typically low-growing and often form mats or [[Cushion plant|cushions]] to reduce water loss through [[evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heather Pardoe |year=1995 |title=Mountain Plants of the British Isles |publisher=[[National Museums and Galleries of Wales]] |isbn=0-7200-0423-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often assumed that an organism which currently has an Arctic–alpine distribution was, during colder periods of the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] (such as during the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s), widespread across the area between the Arctic and the Alps. This is known from [[pollen]] records to be true for ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', for instance. In other cases, the disjunct distribution may be the result of [[long-distance dispersal]].

'''Asymptotic safety''' (sometimes also referred to as '''nonperturbative renormalizability''') is a concept in [[quantum field theory]] which aims at finding a consistent and predictive quantum theory of the [[Gravitation|gravitational field]]. Its key ingredient is a [[#Gaussian_and_non-Gaussian_fixed_points|nontrivial fixed point]] of the theory's [[renormalization group]] flow which controls the behavior of the [[coupling constants]] in the ultraviolet (UV) regime and renders physical quantities safe from divergences. Although originally proposed by [[Steven Weinberg]] to find a theory of [[quantum gravity]], the idea of a nontrivial fixed point providing a possible [[UV completion]] can be applied also to other field theories, in particular to [[Renormalization#Renormalizability|perturbatively nonrenormalizable]] ones.  In this respect, it is similar to [[quantum triviality]].

The essence of asymptotic safety is the observation that nontrivial renormalization group fixed points can be used to generalize the procedure of [[Renormalization|perturbative renormalization]]. In an asymptotically safe theory the [[coupling constant|couplings]] do not need to be small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial [[UV fixed point]]. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in [[S-Matrix|scattering amplitudes]]. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the [[Action (physics)|bare action]] and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.

As for gravity, the standard procedure of perturbative renormalization fails since [[Newton's constant]], the relevant expansion parameter, has negative [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] rendering [[general relativity]] perturbatively nonrenormalizable. This has driven the search for nonperturbative frameworks describing quantum gravity, including asymptotic safety which — in contrast to other approaches—is characterized by its use of quantum field theory methods, without depending on perturbative techniques, however. At the present time, there is accumulating evidence for a fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety, while a rigorous proof of its existence is still lacking.

== Motivation ==
Gravity, at the classical level, is described by [[Einstein field equation|Einstein's field equations]] of general relativity,
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda = 8 \pi G \, T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;. These equations combine the [[spacetime]] geometry encoded in the [[metric tensor|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; with the matter content comprised in the [[stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The quantum nature of matter has been tested experimentally, for instance [[quantum electrodynamics]] is by now one of the most accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] of Newton's constant is &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;. The problem occurs as follows. According to the [[renormalization|traditional point of view]] renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in [[loop integral]]s. Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number. As this inevitably leads to an infinite number of free parameters to be measured in experiments, the program is unlikely to have predictive power beyond its use as a low energy [[Effective field theory|effective theory]].

It turns out that the first divergences in the quantization of general relativity which cannot be absorbed in counterterms consistently (i.e. without the necessity of introducing new parameters) appear already at one-loop level in the presence of matter fields.&lt;ref name=tHooft&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hooft|first=Gerard|last2=Veltman |first2=Martinus J. G.|title=One-loop divergences in the theory of gravitation|journal=Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincaré|year=1974|volume=20|series=A|pages=69–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At two-loop level the problematic divergences arise even in pure gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goroff|first=Marc H.|author2=Sagnotti, Augusto|title=The ultraviolet behavior of Einstein gravity|journal=Nuclear Physics|year=1986|volume=266|series=B|issue=3–4|pages=709–736|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(86)90193-8|bibcode = 1986NuPhB.266..709G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to overcome this conceptual difficulty the development of nonperturbative techniques was required, providing various [[Quantum gravity#Candidate theories|candidate theories of quantum gravity]].
For a long time the prevailing view has been that the very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful in the case of the other fundamental interactions — is doomed to failure for gravity. By way of contrast, the idea of asymptotic safety retains quantum fields as the theoretical arena and instead abandons only the traditional program of perturbative renormalization.

== History of asymptotic safety ==
After having realized the perturbative nonrenormalizability of gravity, physicists tried to employ alternative techniques to cure the divergence problem, for instance resummation or extended theories with suitable matter fields and symmetries, all of which come with their own drawbacks. In 1976, [[Steven Weinberg]] proposed a generalized version of the condition of renormalizability, based on a nontrivial fixed point of the underlying [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow for gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Critical Phenomena for Field Theorists |editor-last=Zichichi |editor-first=Antonino |title=Understanding the Fundamental Constituents of Matter |pages=1–52|year=1978|series= The Subnuclear Series|volume=14 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0931-4_1|isbn=978-1-4684-0931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was called asymptotic safety.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Ultraviolet divergences in quantum theories of gravitation|year=1979|title=General Relativity: An Einstein centenary survey |editor1=S.

The idea of a UV completion by means of a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization groups had been proposed earlier by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] and [[Giorgio Parisi]] in [[scalar field theory]]&lt;ref name="WilsonReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|author2=Kogut, John B.|title=The renormalization group and the ε expansion|journal=Physics Reports|year=1974|volume=12|issue=2|pages=75–199|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(74)90023-4|bibcode = 1974PhR....12...75W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Parisi| first= Giorgio | title=On Non-Renormalizable Interactions | journal= New Developments in Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics Cargèse | year=1976 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-8918-1_12 | pages=281–305| isbn= 978-1-4615-8920-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(see also [[Quantum triviality]]).
The applicability to perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories was first demonstrated explicitly for the [[Non-linear sigma model]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Brezin | first= Eduard |author2= Zinn-Justin, Jean| title=Renormalization of the nonlinear sigma model in 2 + epsilon dimensions | journal=Physical Review Letters| year= 1976 | volume=36 | issue= 13 |pages=691–693|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.36.691 |bibcode = 1976PhRvL..36..691B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a variant of the [[Gross-Neveu model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaw&amp;#281;dzki|first=Krzysztof|author2=Kupiainen, Antti|title=Renormalizing the nonrenormalizable|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=1985|volume=55|issue=4|pages=363–365|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.363|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55..363G|pmid=10032331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for gravity, the first studies concerning this new concept were performed in &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions in the late seventies. In exactly two dimensions there is a theory of pure gravity that is renormalizable according to the old point of view. (In order to render the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {1 \over 16\pi G} \int \mathrm{d}^2 x \sqrt{g} \, R&lt;/math&gt; dimensionless, Newton's constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; must have [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] zero.) For small but finite &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is still applicable, and one can expand the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-function]] (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-function) describing the renormalization group running of Newton's constant as a power series in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, in this spirit it was possible to prove that it displays a nontrivial fixed point.&lt;ref name="Weinberg" /&gt;

However, it was not clear how to do a continuation from &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions as the calculations relied on the smallness of the expansion parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The computational methods for a nonperturbative treatment were not at hand by this time. For this reason the idea of asymptotic safety in quantum gravity was put aside for some years. Only in the early 90s, aspects of &lt;math&gt;2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensional gravity have been revised in various works, but still not continuing the dimension to four.

As for calculations beyond perturbation theory, the situation improved with the advent of new [[functional renormalization group]] methods, in particular the so-called ''effective average action'' (a scale dependent version of the [[effective action]]). Introduced in 1993 by [[Christof Wetterich]] and Tim R Morris for scalar theories,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wetterich|first=Christof|title=Exact evolution equation for the effective potential|journal=Phys.

In 1996, Martin Reuter constructed a similar effective average action and the associated flow equation for the gravitational field.&lt;ref name="MR1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|title=Nonperturbative evolution equation for quantum gravity|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=57|series=D|year=1998|pages=971–985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.57.971|issue=2|arxiv=hep-th/9605030|bibcode = 1998PhRvD..57..971R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It complies with the requirement of [[background independence]], one of the fundamental tenets of quantum gravity. This work can be considered an essential breakthrough in asymptotic safety related studies on quantum gravity as it provides the possibility of nonperturbative computations for arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It was shown that at least for the [[#The_Einstein–Hilbert_truncation|Einstein–Hilbert truncation]], the simplest ansatz for the effective average action, a nontrivial fixed point is indeed present.

These results mark the starting point for many calculations that followed. Since it was not clear in the pioneer work by Martin Reuter to what extent the findings depended on the truncation ansatz considered, the next obvious step consisted in enlarging the truncation. This process was initiated by Roberto Percacci and collaborators, starting with the inclusion of matter fields.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dou|first=Djamel|author2=Percacci, Roberto|title=The running gravitational couplings|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|year=1998|volume=15|issue=11|pages=3449–3468|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/15/11/011|arxiv=hep-th/9707239|bibcode = 1998CQGra..15.3449D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to the present many different works by a continuously growing community – including, e.g., &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;- and [[Weyl tensor]] squared truncations – have confirmed independently that the asymptotic safety scenario is actually possible: The existence of a nontrivial fixed point was shown within each truncation studied so far.&lt;ref name="reviews"&gt;For reviews on asymptotic safety and QEG with comprehensive lists of references see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although still lacking a final proof, there is mounting evidence that the asymptotic safety program can ultimately lead to a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity within the general framework of [[quantum field theory]].

== Asymptotic safety: The main idea ==

=== Theory space ===

[[File:UVCriticalSurfaceInTheorySpace.png|thumb|380px|Trajectories of the [[renormalization group]] flow in theory space, parametrized by infinitely many coupling constants. By convention, the arrows of the vector field (and the one on the green trajectory) point from UV to IR scales. The set of actions which lie inside the theory space and are pulled into the [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] under the inverse RG flow (i.e., going in the direction opposite to the arrows) is referred to as UV critical surface. The asymptotic safety hypothesis is that a trajectory can only be realized in Nature if it is contained in the UV critical surface since only then it has a well-behaved high energy limit (orange, blue, and magenta trajectories, by way of example). Trajectories outside this surface escape theory space for &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; since they develop unacceptable divergences in the UV, while going to lower scales they approach the UV critical surface. This situation is represented by the green trajectory which lies above the surface and runs away from it for increasing RG scale (opposite to the green arrow).]]

The asymptotic safety program adopts a modern [[Renormalization group|Wilsonian viewpoint]] on quantum field theory. Here the basic input data to be fixed at the beginning are, firstly, the kinds of quantum fields carrying the theory's [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and, secondly, the underlying [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For any theory considered, these data determine the stage the renormalization group dynamics takes place on, the so-called theory space. It consists of all possible action functionals depending on the fields selected and respecting the prescribed symmetry principles. Each point in this theory space thus represents one possible action. Often one may think of the space as spanned by all suitable field monomials. In this sense any action in theory space is a linear combination of field monomials, where the corresponding coefficients are the [[coupling constants]], &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. (Here all couplings are assumed to be dimensionless. Couplings can always be made dimensionless by multiplication with a suitable power of the RG scale.)

=== Renormalization group flow ===

The [[renormalization group]] (RG) describes the change of a physical system due to smoothing or averaging out microscopic details when going to a lower resolution. This brings into play a notion of scale dependence for the action functionals of interest. Infinitesimal RG transformations map actions to nearby ones, thus giving rise to a vector field on theory space. The scale dependence of an action is encoded in a "running" of the coupling constants parametrizing this action, &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\} \equiv \{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt;, with the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. This gives rise to a trajectory in theory space (RG trajectory), describing the evolution of an action functional with respect to the scale. Which of all possible trajectories is realized in Nature has to be determined by measurements.

=== Taking the UV limit ===

The construction of a quantum field theory amounts to finding an RG trajectory which is infinitely extended in the sense that the action functional described by &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt; is well-behaved for all values of the momentum scale parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, including the [[infrared limit]] &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and the ultraviolet (UV) limit &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Asymptotic safety is a way of dealing with the latter limit. Its fundamental requirement is the existence of a [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] of the RG flow. By definition this is a point &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha^*\}&lt;/math&gt; in the theory space where the running of all couplings stops, or, in other words, a zero of all [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]]: &lt;math&gt;\beta_\gamma(\{g_\alpha^*\})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In addition that fixed point must have at least one UV-attractive direction. This ensures that there are one or more RG trajectories which run into the fixed point for increasing scale. The set of all points in the theory space that are "pulled" into the UV fixed point by going to larger scales is referred to as ''UV critical surface''. Thus the UV critical surface consists of all those trajectories which are safe from UV divergences in the sense that all couplings approach finite fixed point values as &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The key hypothesis underlying asymptotic safety is that only trajectories running entirely within the UV critical surface of an appropriate fixed point can be infinitely extended and thus define a fundamental quantum field theory. It is obvious that such trajectories are well-behaved in the UV limit as the existence of a fixed point allows them to "stay at a point" for an infinitely long RG "time".

With regard to the fixed point, UV-attractive directions are called relevant, UV-repulsive ones irrelevant, since the corresponding scaling fields increase and decrease, respectively, when the scale is lowered. Therefore, the dimensionality of the UV critical surface equals the number of relevant couplings. An asymptotically safe theory is thus the more predictive the smaller is the dimensionality of the corresponding UV critical surface.

For instance, if the UV critical surface has the finite dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; it is sufficient to perform only &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; measurements in order to uniquely identify Nature's RG trajectory. Once the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; relevant couplings are measured, the requirement of asymptotic safety fixes all other couplings since the latter have to be adjusted in such a way that the RG trajectory lies within the UV critical surface. In this spirit the theory is highly predictive as infinitely many parameters are fixed by a finite number of measurements.

In contrast to other approaches, a bare action which should be promoted to a quantum theory is not needed as an input here. It is the theory space and the RG flow equations that determine possible UV fixed points. Since such a fixed point, in turn, corresponds to a bare action, one can consider the bare action a prediction in the asymptotic safety program. This may be thought of as a systematic search strategy among theories that are already "quantum" which identifies the "islands" of physically acceptable theories in the "sea" of unacceptable ones plagued by short distance singularities.

=== Gaussian and non-Gaussian fixed points ===

A fixed point is called ''Gaussian'' if it corresponds to a free theory. Its [[critical exponents]] agree with the [[classical scaling dimension|canonical mass dimensions]] of the corresponding operators which usually amounts to the trivial fixed point values &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all essential couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Thus standard perturbation theory is applicable only in the vicinity of a Gaussian fixed point. In this regard asymptotic safety at the Gaussian fixed point is equivalent to perturbative renormalizability plus [[asymptotic freedom]]. Due to the arguments presented in the introductory sections, however, this possibility is ruled out for gravity.

In contrast, a nontrivial fixed point, that is, a fixed point whose critical exponents differ from the canonical ones, is referred to as ''non-Gaussian''. Usually this requires &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for at least one essential &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is such a non-Gaussian fixed point that provides a possible scenario for quantum gravity. As yet, studies on this subject thus mainly focused on establishing its existence.

=== Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) ===

Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is the generic name for any quantum field theory of gravity that (regardless of its [[Action (physics)|bare action]]) takes the [[metric tensor|spacetime metric]] as the dynamical field variable and whose symmetry is given by [[diffeomorphism invariance]]. This fixes the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] and an RG flow of the effective average action defined over it, but it does not single out a priori any specific action functional. However, the flow equation determines a vector field on that theory space which can be investigated. If it displays a non-Gaussian fixed point by means of which the UV limit can be taken in the "asymptotically safe" way, this point acquires the status of the bare action.

== Implementation via the effective average action ==

=== Exact functional renormalization group equation ===

{{Main article|Functional renormalization group}}
The primary tool for investigating the gravitational [[renormalization group|RG]] flow with respect to the energy scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at the nonperturbative level is the effective average action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; for gravity.&lt;ref name="MR1"/&gt; It is the scale dependent version of the [[effective action]] where in the underlying [[Functional integration|functional integral]] field modes with covariant [[momenta]] below &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; are suppressed while only the remaining are integrated out. For a given theory space, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of dynamical and background fields, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following [[Functional renormalization group|Wetterich-Morris-type functional RG equation]] (FRGE):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k \partial_k \Gamma_k\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] = \frac{1}{2}\,\mbox{STr}\Big[\big(\Gamma_k^{(2)}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] + \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]\big)^{-1} k \partial_k \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}] \Big] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^{(2)} &lt;/math&gt; is the second [[functional derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the quantum fields  &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; at fixed &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;. The mode suppression operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]&lt;/math&gt; provides a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dependent mass-term for fluctuations with covariant momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \ll k^2&lt;/math&gt; and vanishes for &lt;math&gt;p^2 \gg k^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Its appearance in the numerator and denominator renders the [[supertrace]] &lt;math&gt;(\mbox{STr})&lt;/math&gt; both infrared and UV finite, peaking at momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \approx k^2&lt;/math&gt;. The FRGE is an exact equation without any perturbative approximations. Given an initial condition it determines &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; for all scales uniquely.

The solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the FRGE interpolate between the bare (microscopic) action at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; and the [[effective action]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma[\Phi] = \Gamma_{k=0}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}=\Phi\big] &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;. They can be visualized as trajectories in the underlying [[#Theory_space|theory space]]. Note that the FRGE itself is independent of the bare action. In the case of an asymptotically safe theory, the bare action is determined by the fixed point functional &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_* = \Gamma_{k\rightarrow\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Truncations of the theory space ===

Let us assume there is a set of basis functionals &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; spanning the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] under consideration so that any action functional, i.e. any point of this theory space, can be written as a linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'s. Then solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] have expansions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this expansion into the FRGE and expanding the trace on its right-hand side in order to extract the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]], one obtains the exact RG equation in component form: &lt;math&gt;k \partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,g_2,\cdots)&lt;/math&gt;. Together with the corresponding initial conditions these equations fix the evolution of the running couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus determine &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; completely. As one can see, the FRGE gives rise to a system of ''infinitely many'' coupled differential equations since there are infinitely many couplings, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can depend on all of them. This makes it very hard to solve the system in general.

A possible way out is to restrict the analysis on a finite-dimensional subspace as an approximation of the full theory space. In other words, such a ''truncation of the theory space'' sets all but a finite number of couplings to zero, considering only the reduced basis &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt;. This amounts to the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^N g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] ,
&lt;/math&gt;

leading to a system of finitely many coupled differential equations, &lt;math&gt;k\partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,\cdots,g_N)&lt;/math&gt;, which can now be solved employing analytical or numerical techniques.

Clearly a truncation should be chosen such that it incorporates as many features of the exact flow as possible. Although it is an approximation, the truncated flow still exhibits the nonperturbative character of the FRGE, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can contain contributions from all powers of the couplings.

Dark background color indicates a region of fast flow, in regions of light background the flow is slow or even zero. The latter case includes a vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point in the origin, and the NGFP in the center of the spiralling arrows, respectively. The cross-over trajectory tangent to the &lt;span style="color:#00d000"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; arrows connects the non-Gaussian to the Gaussian fixed point and plays the role of a [[Separatrix (dynamical systems)|separatrix]].]]

=== The Einstein–Hilbert truncation ===

As described in the previous section, the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] lends itself to a systematic construction of nonperturbative approximations to the gravitational [[beta function (physics)|beta-functions]] by projecting the exact RG flow onto subspaces spanned by a suitable ansatz for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt;. In its simplest form, such an ansatz is given by the Einstein–Hilbert action where [[gravitational constant|Newton's constant]] &lt;math&gt;G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the [[cosmological constant]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; depend on the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; denote the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; reads, for arbitrary spacetime dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] = \frac{1}{16\pi G_k} \int\text{d}^d x\, \sqrt{g}\, \big( -R(g) + 2\Lambda_k \big) + \Gamma_k^\text{gf}[g,\bar{g}] + \Gamma_k^\text{gh}[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:QEGPhasePortraitEH.png|thumb|220px|Phase portrait for the Einstein–Hilbert truncation. Shown are the [[#Renormalization_group_flow|RG trajectories]] corresponding to the flow diagram on the left-hand side.

Rev. |year=2002|volume=65|issue=6|series=D|pages=065016|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.065016|arxiv=hep-th/0110054|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65f5016R }}
&lt;/ref&gt;)]]

Here &lt;math&gt;R(g)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]] constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gf}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[gauge fixing|gauge fixing action]], and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gh}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|ghost action]] with the ghost fields &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\xi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions, describing the evolution of the dimensionless Newton constant &lt;math&gt;g_k=k^{d-2} G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the dimensionless cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k=k^{-2}\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt;, have been derived for the first time in reference&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; for any value of the spacetime dimensionality, including the cases of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; below and above &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. In particular, in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions they give rise to the RG flow diagram shown on the left-hand side. The most important result is the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety. It is UV-attractive both in &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;- and in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-direction.

This fixed point is related to the [[#History_of_asymptotic_safety|one]] found in &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensions by perturbative methods in the sense that it is recovered in the nonperturbative approach presented here by inserting &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; into the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions and expanding in powers of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; Since the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions were shown to exist and explicitly computed for any real, i.e., not necessarily integer value of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, no analytic continuation is involved here. The fixed point in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, too, is a direct result of the nonperturbative flow equations, and, in contrast to the earlier attempts, no extrapolation in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is required.

=== Extended truncations ===

Subsequently, the existence of the fixed point found within the Einstein–Hilbert truncation has been confirmed in subspaces of successively increasing complexity. The next step in this development was the inclusion of an &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt;-term in the truncation ansatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Flow equation of quantum Einstein gravity in a higher-derivative truncation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=66|issue=2|pages=025026|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.025026|arxiv=hep-th/0205062|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..66b5026L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This has been extended further by taking into account polynomials of the scalar curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (so-called &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;-truncations),&lt;ref name="fRgravity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Codello|first=Alessandro|author2=Percacci, Roberto|author3= Rahmede, Christoph|title=Ultraviolet properties of f(R)-gravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|year=2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=143–150|doi=10.1142/S0217751X08038135|arxiv=0705.1769|bibcode = 2008IJMPA..23..143C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the square of the [[Weyl tensor|Weyl curvature tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benedetti|first=Dario|author2=Machado, Pedro F.|author3= Saueressig, Frank|title=Asymptotic safety in higher-derivative gravity|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|year=2009|volume=24|issue=28|pages=2233–2241|doi=10.1142/S0217732309031521|arxiv=0901.2984|bibcode = 2009MPLA...24.2233B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The contact to perturbation theory is established in: {{cite journal|last=Niedermaier|first=Max|title=Gravitational Fixed Points from Perturbation Theory|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2009|volume=103|issue=10|pages=101303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.101303|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.103j1303N|pmid=19792294}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, the impact of various kinds of matter fields has been investigated.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci" /&gt;
Also computations based on a field reparametrization invariant effective average action seem to recover the crucial fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Donkin|first=Ivan|author2=Pawlowski, Jan M.|title=The phase diagram of quantum gravity from diffeomorphism-invariant RG-flows|year=2012|eprint=1203.4207|&lt;!--bibcode = 2012arXiv1203.4207D--&gt; |class=hep-th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In combination these results constitute strong evidence that gravity in four dimensions is a nonperturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory, indeed with a [[#Asymptotic safety: The main idea|UV critical surface]] of reduced dimensionality, coordinatized by only a few relevant couplings.&lt;ref name="reviews" /&gt;

{{clear}}

== The microscopic structure of spacetime ==

Results of asymptotic safety related investigations indicate that the effective [[spacetime]]s of [[#Quantum_Einstein_Gravity_(QEG)|QEG]] have [[fractal]]-like properties on microscopic scales. It is possible to determine, for instance, their spectral dimension and argue that they undergo a dimensional reduction from 4 dimensions at [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic distances]] to 2 dimensions microscopically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Ultraviolet fixed point and generalized flow equation of quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2001|volume=65|issue=2|pages=025013|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.025013|arxiv=hep-th/0108040|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65b5013L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Fractal spacetime structure in asymptotically safe gravity|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2005|volume=10|issue=10|pages=050|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050|arxiv=hep-th/0508202|bibcode = 2005JHEP...10..050L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context it might be possible to draw the connection to other approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. to [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s, and compare the results.&lt;ref&gt;For a review see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]]: Reuter; Saueressig (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity ==

{{Main article|Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity}}

Phenomenological consequences of the asymptotic safety scenario have been investigated in many areas of gravitational physics. As an example, asymptotic safety in combination with the [[Standard Model]] allows a statement about the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] and the value of the [[fine structure constant]].&lt;ref name="appl"&gt;See main article [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity]] and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, it provides possible explanations for particular phenomena in [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]], concerning [[black holes]] or [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], for instance.&lt;ref name="appl" /&gt; These different studies take advantage of the possibility that the requirement of asymptotic safety can give rise to new predictions and conclusions for the models considered, often without depending on additional, possibly unobserved, assumptions.

The [[drag coefficient]] is a common measure in [[automotive design]] as it pertains to [[aerodynamics]]. Drag is a force that acts parallel and in the same direction as the airflow. The drag coefficient of an automobile impacts the way the automobile passes through the surrounding air. When automobile companies design a new vehicle they take into consideration the '''automobile drag coefficient''' in addition to the other performance characteristics. Aerodynamic drag increases with the square of speed; therefore it becomes critically important at higher speeds. Reducing the drag coefficient in an automobile improves the performance of the vehicle as it pertains to speed and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/03/reducing-drag-on-cars-and-trucks-by-15.html |title=Reducing Drag on Cars and Trucks by 15-18% |first=Brian |last=Wang |work=Next Big Future |date=2009-03-16 |access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different ways to reduce the drag of a vehicle.  A common way to measure the drag of the vehicle is through the drag area.

==Reducing drag==
The reduction of drag in road vehicles has led to increases in the top speed of the vehicle and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aerocivic.com/ |title=Aerocivic - Honda Civic modifications for maximum gas mileage - |first=Mike |last=Turner |website=aerocivic |access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the [[drag coefficient]]. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics is that it may cause the vehicle to get too much lift. [[Lift (force)|Lift]] is an aerodynamic force that acts perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camaro-untoldsecrets.com/articles/rpo_d80.htm |title=Camaro Spoiler Equipment |first=Wayne D. |last=Guinn |website=Camaro - Untold Secrets |location=US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000519115318/http://www.camaro-untoldsecrets.com/articles/rpo_d80.htm |archive-date=2000-05-19 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.

==Deletion==
The deletion of parts on a vehicle is an easy way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce [[Parasitic_drag|parasitic]] and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion can be as simple as removing an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an [[OEM]] part, meaning any part of the vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotrod.com/techarticles/body/hdrp_0609_aero_tricks_tips/viewall.html |title=Aerodynamic Tips and Tricks You Can Use for Better Performance |first=Marlan |last=Davis |work=Hot Rod Magazine |location=US |date=February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422165215/http://www.hotrod.com/techarticles/body/hdrp_0609_aero_tricks_tips/viewall.html |archive-date=2012-04-22 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roof rack===
A [[roof rack]] is a common trait on many [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] and [[station wagon]] vehicles. While roof racks are very useful in carrying extra storage on a vehicle, they also increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the drag coefficient. This is because the air flows over the top of the vehicle, following the smooth lines of the hood and windshield, then collides with the roof rack and causes turbulence. The removal of this part has led to increases in fuel efficiency in several studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metrompg.com/posts/roof-racks.htm |title=Mini-experiment: the wrath of roof racks |work=MetroMPG |location=US |date=2007-03-07 |access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mud flaps===
[[Mudflap]]s are now rarely specified as standard on production cars as they interfere with the clean airflow around the vehicle. For larger vehicles such as trucks, mud flaps are still important for their control of spray, and in 2010 a new version of the mud flap was introduced that has been shown to create significantly less aerodynamic drag than standard mud flaps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecoflaps.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rear spoiler===
A rear spoiler usually comes standard in most sports vehicles and resembles the shape of a raised wing in the rear of the vehicle. The main purpose of a [[Spoiler (automotive)|rear spoiler]] in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google Books |id=BMVR37-8Jh0C |page=448 |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.

===Side mirrors===
[[Side mirror]]s both increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the coefficient of drag since they protrude from the side of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://metrompg.com/posts/mirrors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google Books |id=UzJqTX4LPOsC |page=490 |title=The Aerodynamics of Heavy Vehicles: Trucks, Buses, and Trains, Volume 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to decrease the impact that side mirrors have on the drag of the vehicle the side mirrors can be replaced with smaller mirrors or mirrors with a different shape. Several [[concept cars]] of the 2010s are replacing mirrors with tiny cameras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First drive review: Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/porsche/panamera/first-drives/first-drive-review-porsche-panamera-sport-turismo|website=Autocar|accessdate=2013-03-01 |date=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this option is not common for production cars because most countries require side mirrors.

===Radio antenna===
While they do not have the biggest impact on the drag coefficient due to their small size, [[radio antenna]]s commonly found protruding from the front of the vehicle can be relocated and changed in design to rid the car of this added drag. The most common replacement for the standard car antenna is the shark fin antenna found in most high efficiency vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualv8.com/freport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windshield wipers===
The effect that [[windshield wipers]] have on a vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts in order to maintain the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-air-deflector.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative is to equip the vehicle with a single wiper placed in the centre of the windshield, allowing it to cover both sides of the windshield. This mitigates the amount of drag by decreasing the frontal area of the blade. While such application may be useful for racing, for most road vehicles this would produce minimal improvement in overall drag reduction.

==Fabrication==
The application of new parts and concepts onto the vehicle design are easier to include when in the design stage of a vehicle, rather than in [[aftermarket (automotive)]] parts, however, the fabrication of these parts assists in the streamlining of the vehicle and can help greatly reduce the drag of the vehicle. Most vehicles with very low [[drag coefficient]]s, such as race cars and high efficiency concept cars, apply these ideas to their design.&lt;ref&gt;http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/ChEHeXOTnf3dHH5qjYRXMA/10_Browand_10_11_trans.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheel covers===
[[File:2013072912 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.png|thumb|Hyundai Sonata Hybrid alloy wheel]]

When air flows around the wheel wells it gets disturbed by the rims of the vehicles and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow more smoothly around the wheel well, smooth [[wheel cover]]s are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag; however, it may cause the brakes to heat up more quickly because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. As a result, this modification is more commonly seen in high efficiency vehicles rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.&lt;ref name="wwwm.coventry.ac.uk"&gt;http://wwwm.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/lowcarbonvehicles/Documents/Aerodynamic%20Challenge%20Event%20Documents/Session%204%20-%201%20-%20Hussain%20Ali%20-%20Drag%20Reduction%20on%20a%20Production%20Vehicle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air curtains===
[[File:2017 Land Rover Discovery HSE TD6 Automatic 3.0 Front.jpg|thumb|2017 Land Rover Discovery with front air curtains]]

Air curtains divert air flow from slots in the body and guide it towards the outside edges of the wheel wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bridger |first1=Gabriel |title=The 1M's Air Curtain in Detail |url=http://www.bimmerfile.com/2010/12/13/the-1ms-air-curtain-in-detail/ |work=BimmerFile |date=2010-12-13 |access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=How Air Curtains on F-150 Help Reduce Aerodynamic Drag and Aid Fuel Efficiency |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/07/15/how-air-curtains-on-f-150-help-reduce-aerodynamic-drag.html |date=2015-07-15 |access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Designing for design’s sake—with aerodynamics built in |url=http://world.honda.com/environment/face/2016/case58/episode/episode03.html |publisher=Honda |accessdate=2018-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220013235/http://world.honda.com/environment/face/2016/case58/episode/episode03.html |archivedate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial grille block===
The front [[grille]] of a vehicle is used to direct air directly into the engine compartment. In a streamlined design the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the grille of a vehicle redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a grille block is often used. A grille block covers up a portion of, or the entirety of, the front grille of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or in vehicles with low [[drag coefficient]]s, a very small grille will already be built into the vehicle's design, eliminating the need for a grille block. The grille in most production vehicles is generally designed to maximize air flow into the engine compartment to keep it from overheating. This design can actually create too much airflow into the engine compartment, preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, and in such cases a grille block is used to increase engine performance and reduce vehicle drag simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Korff |first1=Walter Henry |title=Designing tomorrow's cars: from concept, step-by-step, to detail design |date=1980 |publisher=M-C Publications |isbn=9780960385003 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

===Under tray===
The underside of a vehicle often traps air in various places and adds turbulence around the vehicle. In most racing vehicles this is eliminated by covering the entire underside of the vehicle in what is called an under tray. This tray prevents any air from becoming trapped under the vehicle and reduces drag.&lt;ref name="wwwm.coventry.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Fender skirts===
[[Fender skirts]] are often made as extensions of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining the body of the vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the [[Honda Insight#First generation (1999–2006)|first generation Honda Insight]]. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.&lt;ref name="wwwm.coventry.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Modified front bumper===
The front bumper is the first part of the vehicle that the air must flow around. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in reducing drag. A front air dam is often used which extends from the very front of the vehicle down to the lowest part of the vehicle. This is done to direct airflow around and over the vehicle rather than allowing air to travel under it. Contoured deflectors, or tire spats, are often made as part of the front bumper in order to direct airflow around the tire without having any increase to the outward flow.

===Boattails and Kammbacks===
A boattail can greatly reduce a vehicle's total drag. Boattails create a teardrop shape that will give the vehicle a more streamlined profile, reducing the occurrence of drag inducing [[flow separation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google Books |id=ldgDAAAAMBAJ |page=158 |title=Popular Mechanics Sep 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kammback]] is a truncated boattail. It is created as an extension of the rear of the vehicle, moving the rear backward at a slight angle toward the bumper of the car. This can reduce drag as well but a boattail would reduce the vehicles drag more. Nonetheless, for practical and style reasons, a kammback is more commonly seen in racing, high efficiency vehicles, and trucking.&lt;ref&gt;http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-9821&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical drag coefficients==

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2013}}

The average modern automobile achieves a drag coefficient of between 0.25 and 0.3. [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, with their typically boxy shapes, typically achieve a {{Cd|0.35–0.45}}. The drag coefficient of a vehicle is affected by the shape of body of the vehicle. Various other characteristics affect the coefficient of drag as well, and are taken into account in these examples. Some sports cars have a surprisingly high drag coefficient (Such as the [[Ariel Atom]] at 0.40), but this is to compensate for the amount of lift the vehicle generates, while others use aerodynamics to their advantage to gain speed and as a result have much lower drag coeffecients.

Some examples of '''{{Cd}}''' follow. Figures given are generally for the basic model, which may not be available in some markets. Some "high performance" models may actually have higher drag, due to wider [[tire]]s, extra [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]]s and larger cooling systems as many basic / low power models have half size radiators with the remaining area blanked off to reduce cooling and engine bay drag.

The {{Cd}} of a given vehicle will vary depending on which wind tunnel it is measured in. Variations of up to 5% have been documented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=duMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131 |title=Shaping up tomorrow's cars |first=Wade |last=Hoyt |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1985 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variations in test technique and analysis can also make a difference. So if the same vehicle with a {{Cd|long=yes|0.30}} was measured in a different tunnel it could be anywhere from {{Cd|0.285}} to {{Cd|0.315}}.

&lt;!-- Please maintain alphabetic order within each Cd range (alphabetize all 0.30's for instance) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Cd range for Column 1 &gt;= 0.3, 0.3 &gt; Column 2 =&gt; 0.29, 0.29 &gt; Column 3 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Please provide reliable sources for any additions to this list --&gt;

==Drag area==
While designers pay attention to the overall shape of the automobile, they also bear in mind that reducing the frontal area of the shape helps reduce the drag. The product of drag coefficient and area - drag area - is represented as '''{{CdA}}''' (or '''C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;A'''), a multiplication of the {{Cd}} value by the area.

The term ''drag area'' derives from [[aerodynamics]], where it is the product of some reference area (such as cross-sectional area, total surface area, or similar) and the drag coefficient. In 2003, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine adopted this metric as a more intuitive way to compare the aerodynamic efficiency of various automobiles.

The force required to overcome drag is:
&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \times \text{air density} \times \text{drag coefficient} \times \text{reference area} \times \text{speed}^2 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \times \text{air density} \times \mathbf{\text{drag area} } \times \text{speed}^2 &lt;/math&gt;
Where the drag coefficient and reference area have been collapsed into the drag area term. This allows direct estimation of the drag force at a given speed for any vehicle for which only the drag area is known and therefore easier comparison.

As drag area '''{{CdA}}''' is the fundamental value that determines power required for a given cruise speed it is a critical parameter for fuel consumption at a steady speed. This relation also allows an estimation of the new top speed of a car with a tuned engine,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{estimated top speed} = \text{original top speed} \times \sqrt[3]{\frac{\text{new power}}\text{original power}} &lt;/math&gt;
Or the power required for a target top speed,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{power required} = \text{original power} \times \left( \frac{\text{target speed}}{\text{original speed}} \right)^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Average full-size passenger cars have a drag area of roughly {{convert|8.50|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Reported drag areas range from the 1999 [[Honda Insight]] at {{convert|5.1|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} to the 2003 [[Hummer H2]] at {{convert|26.5|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The drag area of a bicycle (and rider) is also in the range of {{convert|6.5|-|7.5|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafn.org/~dave/trans/energy/bicycle-energy.html#aero_drag |title=(a bicycle's lower frontal area is offset by a higher drag coefficient) |publisher=Lafn.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084256/http://www.lafn.org/~dave/trans/energy/bicycle-energy.html| archivedate=2011-07-17&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry Bozeman''' is a professor at [[Arizona State University]] where he is Director, Center for Organization Research and Design, and Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management.  He specializes in two disparate fields, [[organizational theory|organization theory]] and [[technology policy|science and technology policy]].

== Early life and education ==
Bozeman was born in Birmingham, Alabama on January 18, 1947 to Glenn Bozeman and Audrey J. Bozeman (née Martin).  His mother was a full-time homemaker and this father a construction worker. His early life was characterized by much family relocation, resulting in his attending 21 different schools before the 7th grade.  In 1960, the family settled down in West Palm Beach Florida and Bozeman graduated from Palm Beach High School in 1964.  He attended [[Palm Beach State College|Palm Beach High Junior College]], in Lake Worth Florida, (now Palm Beach State College), graduating in 1966.  Bozeman played on the varsity baseball team at Palm Beach Junior College where he had the distinction of scoring the first run in the new team’s history.

== Career ==
In 1970, Bozeman entered the doctoral program in political science at [[Ohio State University]], focusing on public policy studies.  He graduated in 1973 and, that same year, began as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatech.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, he began specializing in Science and Technology Policy and in 1974, as part of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, took a position as an analyst in the [https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE National Science Foundation’s Division of Information Science and Technology].  After returning briefly to Georgia Tech, Bozeman took a job at the [[University of Missouri|University of Missouri-Columbia]], where he was appointed in the Department of Political Science, as well as the new Department of Public Administration.  In 1977, Bozeman began a long stay (1977-1993) at [https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/ Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs].  While at Syracuse, Bozeman was the Director of the Doctoral Program (1979-1986) and was the founding director of the Center for Technology and Information Policy. He moved in 1993 to be the first full-time director of the new School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech and was later appointed as Regent’s Professor, the first social scientist to become a Regent’s Professor at Georgia Tech. In 2006, Bozeman moved to [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia] where he became the first holder of the [https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman Department of Public Administration and Policy’s Ander Crenshaw Chair in Public Policy].&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Bozeman moved to Arizona State University where he is Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management and Director of the Center for Organization Research and Design.&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly contributions ==
Bozeman’s chief contributions to organization theory and public administration include:

*The theory of “dimensional publicness,” showing all organizations are affected by the constraints and endowment of political authority and of market authority and that behavior can be predicted from the mix of these forces.
*The normative “public value theory,” set as an alternative to market failure theory and suggesting that public values can be attained by a variety of institutions, public and private, acting separately or together. 
*Theory and empirical research on organizational red tape and bureaucratic pathologies.

Bozeman’s chief contributions to science and technology policy include:
*Research and theory on technology transfer, suggesting that a wide variety of outcome measures should be embraced (“contingent theory of effectiveness”) rather than solely short-term market impacts.
*Research and theory on scientific collaboration, both at the level of the individual researcher and the scientific organization or research center.

== Personal life ==
Barry Bozeman and his wife Monica Gaughan live in Tempe, Arizona.  Dr. Gaughan, a sociologist, is a faculty member at Arizona State University. Bozeman has two children from an earlier marriage, a son John and a daughter Brandyn.

'''Biochemical systems theory''' is a [[mathematical model]]ling framework for [[biochemical system]]s, based on ordinary [[differential equation]]s (ODE), in which [[biochemistry|biochemical processes]] are represented using '''power-law''' expansions in the variables of the [[system]].

This framework, which became known as Biochemical Systems Theory, has been developed since the 1960s by [[Michael Savageau]] and others for the [[systems analysis]] of [[biochemical]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biolchem.qui.uc.pt/curso/BST.htm ''Biochemical Systems Theory''], an introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cornish-Bowden (2007) they "regarded this as a general theory of [[metabolic]] control, which includes both metabolic control analysis and flux-oriented theory as special cases".&lt;ref&gt;Athel Cornish-Bowden, [http://bip.cnrs-mrs.fr/bip10/mcafaq4.htm#sava Metabolic control analysis FAQ], website 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The dynamics of a species is represented by a differential equation with the structure:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX_i}{dt}=\sum_j \mu_{ij} \cdot \gamma_j \prod_k X_k^{f_{jk}}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents one of the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; variables of the model (metabolite concentrations, protein concentrations or levels of gene expression). ''j'' represents the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; biochemical processes affecting the dynamics of the species. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; (stoichiometric coefficient), &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; (rate constants) and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; (kinetic orders) are two different kinds of parameters defining the dynamics of the system.

The principal difference of [[power-law]] [[Mathematical model|models]] with respect to other ODE models used in biochemical systems is that the kinetic orders can be non-integer numbers. A kinetic order can have even negative value when inhibition is modelled. In this way, power-law models have a higher flexibility to reproduce the non-linearity of biochemical systems.

Models using power-law expansions have been used during the last 35 years to model and analyse several kinds of biochemical systems including metabolic networks, genetic networks and recently in cell signalling.

The '''[[biochemistry]] of [[body odor]]''' pertains to the [[chemical compound]]s in the [[human body|body]] responsible for body odor and their kinetics.

Body odor encompasses [[axilla]]ry (underarm) [[odor]] and [[foot odor]].&lt;ref name="pmid21401651"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanlayavattanakul M, Lourith N | title = Body malodours and their topical treatment agents | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 298–311 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21401651 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2494.2011.00649.x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a combination of [[sweat gland]] [[secretion]]s and normal [[skin flora|skin microflora]].&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; In addition, [[androstane]] [[steroid]]s and the [[ABCC11]] [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] are essential for most axillary odor.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19710689"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin A, Saathoff M, Kuhn F, Max H, Terstegen L, Natsch A | title = A functional ABCC11 allele is essential in the biochemical formation of human axillary odor | journal = J. Invest. Dermatol. | volume = 130 | issue = 2 | pages = 529–40 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19710689 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2009.254 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Body odor is a complex phenomenon, with numerous compounds and catalysts involved in its genesis.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; Secretions from sweat glands are initially odorless, but preodoriferous compounds or malodor [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]]s in the secretions are transformed by skin surface bacteria into [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] odorous compounds that are responsible for body malodor.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IshikawaToyoda2016" /&gt; [[Water]] and [[nutrient]]s secreted by sweat glands also contribute to body odor by creating an ideal environment for supporting the growth of skin surface bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt;

There are three types of [[sweat gland]]s: [[eccrine gland|eccrine]], [[apocrine gland|apocrine]], and [[apoeccrine]].&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; Apocrine glands are primarily responsible for body malodor and, along with apoeccrine glands, are mostly expressed in the axillary (underarm) regions, whereas eccrine glands are distributed throughout virtually all of the rest of the skin in the body, although they are also particularly expressed in the axillary regions, and contribute to malodor to a relatively minor extent.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; [[Sebaceous gland]]s, another type of [[exocrine gland|secretory gland]], are not sweat glands but instead secrete [[sebum]] (an [[oil]]y substance), and may also contribute to body odor to some degree.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt;

The main odorous compounds that contribute to axillary odor include:&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt;

# [[Unsaturated fat|Unsaturated]] or [[hydroxyl group|hydroxylated]] [[branched chain fatty acids|branched fatty acid]]s, with the key ones being [[trans-3-Methyl-2-hexenoic acid|(''E'')-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid]] (3M2H) and [[3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid]] (HMHA)
# [[Sulfanylalkanol]]s, particularly [[3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol]] (3M3SH)
# Odoriferous androstane steroids, namely the [[pheromone]]s [[androstenone]] (5α-androst-16-en-3-one) and [[androstenol]] (5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol)

These malodorous compounds are formed from non-odoriferous precursors that are secreted from apocrine glands and converted by various [[enzyme]]s expressed in skin surface bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; The specific skin surface bacteria responsible are mainly ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' species.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt;

The androstane steroids [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEA-S) and [[androsterone sulfate]] have been detected in an extract of axillary hairs together with high concentrations of [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref name="pmid23316210" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; Apocrine sweat contains relatively high amounts of [[androgen]]s, for instance [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[androsterone]], and [[testosterone]], and the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), the [[biological target]] of androgens, is strongly expressed in the [[secretory cell]]s of apocrine glands.&lt;ref name="pmid20646085"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin A, Hellhammer J, Hero T, Max H, Schult J, Terstegen L | title = Effective prevention of stress-induced sweating and axillary malodour formation in teenagers | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–7 | year = 2011 | pmid = 20646085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2494.2010.00596.x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[5α-reductase]] [[SRD5A1|type I]], an [[enzyme]] which converts testosterone into the more potent androgen [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), has been found to be highly expressed in the apocrine glands of adolescents, and DHT has been found to specifically contribute to malodor as well.&lt;ref name="pmid21401651" /&gt; Starting at [[puberty]], males have higher levels of androgens than do females and produce comparatively more axillary malodor.&lt;ref name="pmid20646085" /&gt; As such, it has been proposed that the higher axillary malodor seen in males is due to greater relative stimulation of axillary apocrine sweat glands by androgens.&lt;ref name="pmid20646085" /&gt;

[[ABCC11]] is a [[gene]] encoding an [[apical membrane|apical]] [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-driven [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] that has been found to transport a variety of [[lipophilic]] [[anion]]s including [[cyclic nucleotide]]s, [[estradiol glucuronide]], [[steroid]] [[sulfate]]s such as DHEA-S, and [[wikt:monoanionic|monoanionic]] [[bile acid]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; It is expressed and localized in apocrine glands, including in the axilla, the [[ceruminous gland]]s in the [[auditory canal]], and in the [[mammary gland]].&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; A [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) 538G→A in ABCC11 that leads to a G180R substitution in the encoded protein has been found to result in [[loss-of-function mutation|loss-of-function]] via affecting [[N-linked glycosylation]] and in turn causing [[proteasome|proteasomal]] [[metabolism|degradation]] of the [[protein]].&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; This polymorphism has been found to be responsible for the dry and white [[earwax]] [[phenotype]] that is highly prevalent among [[East Asian]]s (80–95%) but is rare among [[white people|European]]s and [[African people|African]]s (0–3%), who conversely have a wet and yellow earwax phenotype, and is considered to be unique as it has been described as the only human SNP that has been found to determine a visible [[genetic trait]].&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; In addition to earwax phenotype, the ABCC11 [[genotype]] has been found to be associated with [[colostrum]] secretion from the [[breast]]s as well as normal axillary odor and [[osmidrosis]] (excessive axillary malodor).&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt;

A functional ABCC11 protein has been found to be essential for the presence of the characteristic strong axillary odor that is typical of Caucasians and Africans, with the 538G→A SNP leading to a loss of secretion of axillary malodorous precursors and a nearly complete loss of axillary odor in [[Asian people|Asian]]s who are [[homozygous]] for the polymorphism.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; Specifically, the secretion of the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugate]]s 3M2H-Gln, HMHA-Gln, and Cys-Gly-(S) 3M3SH, which are precursors of key axillary malodorous compounds including the unsaturated or hydroxylated branched-chain fatty acids 3M2H and HMHA and the sulfanylalkanol 3M3SH, has been found to be abolished in homozygotic carriers of the SNP, and the odoriferous androstane steroids androstenone and androstenol and their precursors DHEA and DHEA-S have been found to be significantly reduced as well.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; In addition, Asians have been found to have relatively small axillary apocrine glands, whereas patients with axillary osmidrosis (538G/G or 538G/A genotype) were found to have significantly more numerous and relatively large axillary apocrine glands compared to controls with the A/A genotype.&lt;ref name="IshikawaToyoda2016" /&gt;

In contrast to the aforementioned odoriferous compounds, the levels of [[long-chain fatty acid|long]] [[straight-chain fatty acid]]s such as [[hexadecanoic acid]], [[octadecanoic acid]], [[octadecanoic acid]], and [[linolic acid]] and [[short-chain fatty acid|short]] straight-chain fatty acids such as [[butyric acid]], [[hexanoic acid]], and [[octanoic acid]] in axillary sweat have not been found to be affected by the ABCC11 [[genotype]], which suggests that their secretion is independent of ABCC11.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; These straight-chain fatty acids are odoriferous, but differently and to a much lesser extent compared to branched-chain fatty acids.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; In accordance, it has been said that it is very likely that these [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] straight-chain fatty acids are responsible for the faint sour acidic axillary odor that has previously been observed in most [[Japanese people|Japanese]] individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt; In addition to the secretion of straight-chain fatty acids, axillary microflora did not appear to differ between homozygous carriers of the 538G→A SNP and non-carriers.&lt;ref name="pmid19710689" /&gt;

The [[ABCC11]] [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] appears to be involved both in the transport of androstane steroids into the secretory cells of apocrine glands and in the secretion of preodoriferous compounds from axillary apocrine glands.&lt;ref name="IshikawaToyoda2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ishikawa|first1=Toshihisa|last2=Toyoda|first2=Yu|title=Human ABC Transporter ABCC11: Looking Back Pioneers’ Odyssey and Creating a New Path Toward Clinical Application|year=2016|pages=297–318|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23476-2_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific steroids that ABCC11 has been found to transport include steroid [[sulfate]]s like DHEA-S and [[estrone sulfate]] and steroid [[glucuronide]]s like estradiol glucuronide.&lt;ref name="pmid23316210"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishikawa T, Toyoda Y, Yoshiura K, Niikawa N | title = Pharmacogenetics of human ABC transporter ABCC11: new insights into apocrine gland growth and metabolite secretion | journal = Front Genet | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 306 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23316210 | pmc = 3539816 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2012.00306 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its transport of compounds involved in axillary odor, [[ABCC11]] [[allele]]s are strongly associated with axillary odor.&lt;ref name="IshikawaToyoda2016" /&gt; Asians have little or faint axillary odor, whereas Caucasians and Africans have strong axillary odor, and this has been found to be due to [[genetic variation|genetic difference]]s in the ABCC11 [[gene]].&lt;ref name="IshikawaToyoda2016" /&gt;

The [[Center for Astrophysics]] '''(CfA) [[Redshift Survey]]''' was the first attempt to map the [[large-scale structure of the universe]]. 

The first survey began in 1977 with the objective of calculating the velocities of the brighter galaxies in the nearby universe by measuring their [[redshift]]s at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]  in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The redshift is the relative increase in the wavelength emitted by a light source, in this case a galaxy, moving away from an observer from which its speed and then, using [[Hubble's Law]], its distance can be calculated. A 3-dimensional map of that part of the Universe could thus be produced. This initial data collection was completed by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/zcat/ CfA Redshift Survey and Catalog] Retrieved April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second survey (CfA2) was started in 1985 by [[John Huchra]] and [[Margaret Geller]] and measured the redshifts of 18,000 bright galaxies in the Northern sky by 1995. Data from the second CfA survey showed that galaxies were not evenly distributed but clustered on the spherical surfaces of empty "voids". The project also made the 1989 discovery of the ''[[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]]'', a [[supercluster]] of [[galaxy|galaxies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/4932/897 M. J. Geller &amp; J. P. Huchra, Science 246, 897 (1989)] Retrieved April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by voids that surprised astronomers because its size was larger than could be produced by [[gravitational collapse]] since the [[Age of the Universe|beginning of the universe]]. Since then, superclusters have been described as artifacts of [[quantum fluctuation]]s in the [[cosmic inflation|inflationary epoch]] of the universe.

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space.

extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning. P Munro - Ninth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Werbos]],&lt;ref&gt;Neural networks for control and system identification. PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks]. D Nguyen, B Widrow -  IJCNN'89, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Michael I. Jordan]] and [[David Rumelhart]].&lt;ref&gt;Forward models: Supervised learning with a distal teacher. MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George
|author2=Johnson, Mark

|year=2008
|publisher=University of Chicago press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful. [[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistic]] inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Creativity and the Brain, In: A Handbook of Creativity for Teachers. Ed. Ai-Girl Tan|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=World Scientific Publishing, Singapore, pp 507–530|url=http://cogprints.org/5356/1/06-Creativity-Brain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Intuition, Insight, Imagination and Creativity|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2(3) pp 40–52|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duch_Wlodzislaw/publication/3455552_Intuition_Insight_Imagination_and_Creativity/links/0046352b15de1ce647000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Experiments with computational creativity|first=Duch Wlodzislaw|last=Pilichowski Maciej|year=2007|publisher=Neural Information Processing – Letters and Reviews, 11(4-6) pp 123-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the system Nehovah&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Nehovah: A Neologism Creator Nomen Ipsum|first=Hintze, R. S., and Ventura, D.|last=Smith, M. R.|year=2014|publisher=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC 2014), pp 173-181 | url = http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06//10.1_Smith.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

===Poetry===
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid gray; padding:5px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:right; background:lightyellow"&gt;
More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.&lt;br&gt;I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.&lt;br&gt;I need it for my dreams.
&lt;small&gt;Racter, from ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, San Francisco: Computer Music Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/introducing-mechanic-miner/|title=Introducing Mechanic Miner|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/why-i-think-mechanic-miner-is-exciting/|title=Why I Think Mechanic Miner Is Cool|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

The '''conservation and restoration of neon objects''' is the process of caring for and maintaining neon objects (artworks), and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

==Neon Technology==
[[Georges Claude]], a French engineer, developed neon technology in 1910.  Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.

Neon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.

===Tubes===
Neon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.

===Gases===
Noble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:

==Neon in fine art==
Prior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]’ ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist’s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg’s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).

Chryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon’s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.

Some artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists’ design.

Neon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].

==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==

===Unpacking===
Unpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.

===Cleaning===
Over time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:

*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.
*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.
* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. 
*The piece incurs any damage.

===Electrical safety===
'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.

'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.

Like other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling damaged neon===
Cracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education &amp; Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.

==Re-fabrication==
Neon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must 
* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.
*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.
*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.

==Replication==
Replication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.

Replication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist’s estate. Bruce Nauman is an artist who requires four criteria be met to replicate his original neon artworks. These criteria are:
# The original neon must still be in existence and in working order.
# The current owner must agree to loan the work prior to the creation of a replica.
# The display credit line for the loaned artwork acknowledges the work on view is an exhibition copy and acknowledges the owner of the original artwork.
# The replica will be destroyed at the completion of the exhibition, which must be proven through photographic documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation of Bruce Nauman's Neon Templates|url=http://theglasshouse.org/learn/the-conservation-of-bruce-naumans-neon-templates/|website=The Glass House |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital humanities''' ('''DH''') is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of [[computing]] or [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and the disciplines of the [[humanities]]. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the [[humanities]], as well as the reflection on their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/?page_id=13|title=Intro to Digital Humanities: Introduction|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|date=September 2013|website=UCLA Center for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/melissa-terras/DigitalHumanitiesInfographic.pdf|title=Quantifying Digital Humanities|last=Terras|first=Melissa|date=December 2011|website=UCL Centre for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|title=Digital_Humanities|last=Burdick|first=Anne|last2=Drucker|first2=Johanna|last3=Lunenfeld|first3=Peter|last4=Presner|first4=Todd|last5=Schnapp|first5=Jeffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=November 2012|isbn=9780262312097|location=Open Access eBook|quote=|via=|access-date=2016-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026210950/https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously.

==Definition==
The definition of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the field is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hla3uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Digital+Humanities+in+practice|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|first3=Julianne|date=2012-10-09|publisher=Facet Publishing|isbn=9781856047661|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' (2016) acknowledges the difficulty in defining the field: "Along with the digital archives, quantitative analyses, and tool-building projects that once characterized the field, DH now encompasses a wide range of methods and practices: visualizations of large image sets, 3D modeling of historical artifacts, 'born digital' dissertations, [[hashtag activism]] and the analysis thereof, [[alternate reality game]]s, mobile makerspaces, and more. In what has been called 'big tent' DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/2|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the digital humanities developed out of humanities computing and has become associated with other fields, such as humanistic computing, social computing, and media studies. In concrete terms, the digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections of primary sources (primarily textual) to the [[data mining]] of large cultural data sets to [[topic modeling]]. Digital humanities incorporates both digitized (remediated) and [[born-digital]] materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[art]], [[archaeology]], [[music]], and [[cultural studies]]) and social sciences,&lt;ref name="digital-humanities-network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Humanities Network|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.cam.ac.uk/|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tools provided by [[computing]] (such as [[hypertext]], [[hypermedia]], [[data visualisation]], [[information retrieval]], data mining, [[statistics]], [[text mining]], [[digital mapping]]), and [[electronic publication|digital publishing]]. Related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like [[software studies]], platform studies, and [[critical code studies]]. Fields that parallel the digital humanities include [[new media studies]] and [[information science]] as well as [[media theory of composition]], [[game studies]], particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production, and [[cultural analytics]].

[[File:Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord 2017- 18).jpg|thumb|The Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord, ''Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age'')]]

Berry and Fagerjord have suggested that a way to reconceptualise digital humanities could be through a "digital humanities stack". They argue that "this type of diagram is common in computation and computer science to show how technologies are ‘stacked’ on top of each other in increasing levels of abstraction. Here, [they] use the method in a more illustrative and creative sense of showing the range of activities, practices, skills, technologies and structures that could be said to make up the digital humanities, with the aim of providing a high-level map."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the "diagram can be read as the bottom levels indicating some of the fundamental elements of the digital humanities stack, such as computational thinking and knowledge representation, and then other elements that later build on these. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to the 1930s and1940s in the pioneering work of English professor [[Josephine Miles]] and Jesuit scholar [[Roberto Busa]] and the women they employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Laura|last2=Sagner Buurma|first2=Rachel|date=2018-04-11|title=Search and Replace: Josephine Miles and the Origins of Distant Reading|url=https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace|journal=Modernism / Modernity Print+|volume=3|issue=1|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svensson&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1938-4122| volume = 3| issue = 3| last = Svensson| first = Patrik| title = Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities| journal = Digital Humanities Quarterly| accessdate = 2012-05-30| year = 2009| url = http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000065/000065.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hockney&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Blackwell| isbn = 1405103213| editors = Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth (eds.)| last = Hockney| first = Susan| title = Companion to Digital Humanities| chapter = The History of Humanities Computing| location = Oxford| series = Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture| year = 2004| url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-2-1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-2-1&amp;brand=9781405103213_brand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[IBM]], they created a computer-generated concordance to [[Thomas Aquinas]]' writings known as the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster than processing information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor=20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Polity| isbn = 978-0-7456-9765-9 | last1 = Berry| first1 = David M. | last2 = Fagerjord| first2 = Anders | title = Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age | location = Cambridge | year = 2017 | url=http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745697658,subjectCd-CO30.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tara McPherson has pointed out, the digital humanities also inherit practices and perspectives developed through many artistic and theoretical engagements with electronic screen culture beginning the late 1960s and 1970s. These range from research developed by organizations such as [[SIGGRAPH]] to creations by artists such as [[Charles and Ray Eames]] and the members of [[Experiments in Art and Technology|E.A.T.]] (Experiments in Art and Technology). The Eames and E.A.T. explored nascent computer culture and intermediality in creative works that dovetailed technological innovation with art.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Tara. "DH by Design: Feminism, aesthetics + the digital.” Congress of the Social Science and Humanities. University of Calgary, 2016-05-31. Keynote.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first specialized journal in the digital humanities was ''Computers and the Humanities'', which debuted in 1966. The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) were then founded in 1977 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Soon, there was a need for a standardized protocol for tagging digital texts, and the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) was developed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The TEI project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the ''TEI Guidelines'' in May 1994.&lt;ref name=hockney /&gt; TEI helped shape the field of electronic textual scholarship and led to [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML), which is a tag scheme for digital editing. Researchers also began experimenting with databases and hypertextual editing, which are structured around links and nodes, as opposed to the standard linear convention of print.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the ''[[Women Writers Project]]'', the ''[http://www.rossettiarchive.org/ Rossetti Archive]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, University of Virginia| editor = Jerome J. McGann | title = Rossetti Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.rossettiarchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The William Blake Archive]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| title = The William Blake Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0093-1896| volume = 31| issue = 1| pages = 49–84| last = Liu| first = Alan| title = Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse| journal = Critical Inquiry| year = 2004| jstor = 10.1086/427302| doi=10.1086/427302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of personal computing and the World Wide Web meant that Digital Humanities work could become less centered on text and more on design. The multimedia nature of the internet has allowed Digital Humanities work to incorporate audio, video, and other components in addition to text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The terminological change from "humanities computing" to "digital humanities" has been attributed to [[John Unsworth]], Susan Schreibman, and Ray Siemens who, as editors of the anthology ''A Companion to Digital Humanities'' (2004), tried to prevent the field from being viewed as "mere digitization."&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Fitzpatrick| first = Kathleen| title = The humanities, done digitally| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2011-07-10| date = 2011-05-08| url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Humanities-Done-Digitally/127382/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the hybrid term has created an overlap between fields like rhetoric and composition, which use "the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects,"&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"/&gt; and digital humanities, which uses "digital technology in studying traditional humanities objects".&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick" /&gt; The use of computational systems and the study of computational media within the arts and humanities more generally has been termed the 'computational turn'.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Berry| first = David| title = The Computational Turn: Thinking About the Digital Humanities| work = Culture Machine| accessdate = 2012-01-31| date = 2011-06-01| url = http://culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewDownloadInterstitial/440/470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) launched the Digital Humanities Initiative (renamed Office of Digital Humanities in 2008), which made widespread adoption of the term "digital humanities" all but irreversible in the United States.&lt;ref name="kirschenbaum-dept" /&gt;

Digital humanities emerged from its former niche status and became "big news"&lt;ref name="kirschenbaum-dept"&gt;{{Cite news| volume =| issue = 150| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew G. | title = What is Digital Humanities and What's it Doing in English Departments?| work = ADE Bulletin| accessdate = | year = 2010| url = http://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the 2009 [[Modern Language Association|MLA convention]] in Philadelphia, where digital humanists made "some of the liveliest and most visible contributions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0009-5982| last = Howard| first = Jennifer| title = The MLA Convention in Translation| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | accessdate = 2012-05-31| date = 2009-12-31| url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-MLA-Convention-in/63379/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had their field hailed as "the first 'next big thing' in a long time."&lt;ref name="pannapacker-mla"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pannapacker| first = William| title = The MLA and the Digital Humanities| work = Brainstorm| format = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2012-05-30| date = 2009-12-28| url = http://chronicle.com/blogPost/The-MLAthe-Digital/19468/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Values and methods ==
Although digital humanities projects and initiatives are diverse, they often reflect common values and methods.&lt;ref name="Northwestern University Library"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Honn|first1=Josh|title=A Guide to Digital Humanities: Values Methods|url=http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2015|publisher=Northwestern University Library|accessdate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can help in understanding this hard-to-define field.&lt;ref&gt;Find accessible, brief descriptions of each at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/ A Guide to Digital Humanities archived site].&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the value of being open and accessible, many digital humanities projects and journals are [[open access]] and/or under Creative Commons licensing, showing the field's "commitment to [[open standards]] and [[open source]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities|last=Bradley|first=John|publisher=Ashgate|year=2012|isbn=9781409410683|editors=Marilyn Deegan and Willard McCarty (eds.)|location=Farnham and Burlington|pages=11–26 [14]|chapter=No job for techies: Technical contributions to research in digital humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open access is designed to enable anyone with an internet-enabled device and internet connection to view a website or read an article without having to pay, as well as share content with the appropriate permissions.

Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars,&lt;ref name="neh-odh-grant-opportunities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Grant|title=Grant Opportunities|work=National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities Grant Opportunities|accessdate=25 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is done in contemporary empirical [[social sciences]]. Yet despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in [[media studies]], [[information studies]], [[communication studies]], and [[sociology]]. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship that transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of [[multimedia]], [[metadata]], and dynamic environments (see [[The Valley of the Shadow]] project at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular]] at [[University of Southern California]], or Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pioneers.darthcrimson.org/|title=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing - Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing|website=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the [[Google Books]] corpus.&lt;ref name="Roth 2014"&gt;Roth, S.

Digital humanities is also involved in the creation of software, providing "environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is 'born digital' and lives in various digital contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cnx.org/content/m34246/latest/|title=Digital Humanities 2.0: A Report on Knowledge|last=Presner|first=Todd|work=Connexions|year=2010|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the field is sometimes known as computational humanities.[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Tools ==
Digital humanities scholars use a variety of digital tools for their research, which may take place in an environment as small as a mobile device or as large as a [[virtual reality]] lab. Environments for "creating, publishing and working with digital scholarship include everything from personal equipment to institutes and software to cyberspace."&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Eileen and Ronald G. Musto. (2015). [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/general/digital-humanities-primer-students-and-scholars?format=PB ''The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars.''] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars use advanced programming languages and databases, while others use less complex tools, depending on their needs. DiRT (Digital Research Tools Directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dirtdirectory.org/|title=Welcome // - DiRT Directory|website=dirtdirectory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) offers a registry of digital research tools for scholars. TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170929202656/http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-09-29|title=TAPoR|website=tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a gateway to text analysis and retrieval tools. An accessible, free example of an online textual analysis program is [[Voyant Tools]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyant-tools.org/|title=Voyant Tools|website=voyant-tools.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only requires the user to copy and paste either a body of text or a URL and then click the 'reveal' button to run the program. There is also an online list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital|title=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding [licensed for non-commercial use only] / Digital Humanities Tools|website=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of online or downloadable Digital Humanities tools that are largely free, aimed toward helping students and others who lack access to funding or institutional servers. Free, open source web publishing platforms like [[WordPress]] and [[Omeka]] are also popular tools. [[File:Poemage.png|thumb|300px|Example of a visualization tool used to study poetry in a new way with [http://www.sci.utah.edu/~nmccurdy/Poemage/ Poemage] ]]

== Projects ==
Digital humanities projects are more likely than traditional humanities work to involve a team or a lab, which may be composed of faculty, staff, graduate or undergraduate students, information technology specialists, and partners in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Credit and authorship are often given to multiple people to reflect this collaborative nature, which is different from the sole authorship model in the traditional humanities (and more like the natural sciences).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are thousands of digital humanities projects, ranging from small-scale ones with limited or no funding to large-scale ones with multi-year financial support. Some are continually updated while others may not be due to loss of support or interest, though they may still remain online in either a [[beta version]] or a finished form. The following are a few examples of the variety of projects in the field:&lt;ref&gt;See [https://wiki.commons.gc.cuny.edu/Sample_Projects/ CUNY Academic Commons Wiki Archive] for more.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital archives===

The [[Women Writers Project]] (begun in 1988) is a long-term research project to make pre-Victorian women writers more accessible through an electronic collection of rare texts. The Walt Whitman Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/|title=The Walt Whitman Archive|website=www.whitmanarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (begun in the 1990s) sought to create a hypertext and scholarly edition of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]]’s works and now includes photographs, sounds, and the only comprehensive current bibliography of Whitman criticism. The Emily Dickinson Archive (begun in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/dickinson/|title=Emily Dickinson, From Fascicle to Open Access {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|access-date=2016-12-26}}. See [http://www.edickinson.org/ Emily Dickinson Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of high-resolution images of [[Emily Dickinson|Dickinson]]’s poetry manuscripts as well as a searchable lexicon of over 9,000 words that appear in the poems. [[File:Humanités Numériques.JPG|thumb|300px|Example of [[social network analysis|network analysis]] as an archival tool at the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

The Slave Societies Digital Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/esss/|title=Homepage|website=Slave Societies Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies), directed by Jane Landers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/jane-landers/|title=People|website=Department of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted at Vanderbilt University, preserves endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and African-descended peoples in slave societies. This Digital Archive currently holds 500,000 unique images, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, and documents the history of between 6 and 8 million individuals. They are the most extensive serial records for the history of Africans in the Atlantic World and also include valuable information on the indigenous, European, and Asian populations who lived alongside them. 

The involvement of librarians and archivists plays an important part in digital humanities projects because of the recent expansion of their role so that it now covers [[digital curation]], which is critical in the preservation, promotion, and access to digital collections, as well as the application of scholarly orientation to digital humanities projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities: Preserving and Promoting Archival and Special Collections|last=Sabharwal|first=Arjun|publisher=Elsevier|year=2015|isbn=9780081001431|location=Waltham, MA|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example involves the case of initiatives where archivists help scholars and academics build their projects through their experience in evaluating, implementing, and customizing metadata schemas for library collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Supporting Digital Humanities for Knowledge Acquisition in Modern Libraries|last=Sacco|first=Kathleen|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466684447|location=Hershey, PA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiatives at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] is another example of a digital humanities project. These include the digitization of 17th-century manuscripts, an electronic corpus of Mexican history from the 16th to 19th century, and the visualization of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in [[3D computer graphics|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|publisher=Facet Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781856047661|location=London|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cultural analytics===

"Cultural analytics" refers to the use of computational method for exploration and analysis of large visual collections and also contemporary digital media. The concept was developed in 2005 by [[Lev Manovich]] who then established the Cultural Analytics Lab in 2007 at Qualcomm Institute at California Institute for Telecommunication and Information (Calit2). The lab has been using methods from the field of computer science called Computer Vision many types of both historical and contemporary visual media—for example, all covers of ''Time'' magazine published between 1923 and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/timeline-4535-time-magazine-covers-1923.html|title=Timeline: 4535 Time Magazine Covers, 1923-2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20,000 historical art photographs from the collection in Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/exploratory-visualizations-of-thomas.html|title=A View from Above: Exploratory Visualizations of MoMA Photography Collection|last=|first=|authorlink=Nadav Hochman and Lev Manovich|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one million pages from Manga books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2010/11/one-million-manga-pages_14.html|title=Exploring One Million Manga Pages with Supercomputers and HIPerSpace|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 million images shared on Instagram in 17 global cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/instagram-and-contemporary-image|title=Instagram and Contemporary Image|last=Manovich|first=Lev|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural analytics also includes using methods from media design and data visualization to create interactive visual interfaces for exploration of large visual collections e.g., Selfiecity and On Broadway.

Cultural Analytics research is also addressing a number of theoretical questions. How can we "observe" giant cultural universes of both user-generated and professional media content created today, without reducing them to averages, outliers, or pre-existing categories? How can work with large cultural data help us question our stereotypes and assumptions about cultures? What new theoretical cultural concepts and models are required for studying global digital culture with its new mega-scale, speed, and connectivity? 

The term “cultural analytics” (or “culture analytics”) is now used by many other researchers, as exemplified by two academic symposiums,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/events/uc/cultural_analytics/ Cultural Analytics: Computational Approaches to the Study of Culture],” the University of Chicago, May 2015 and “[https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/ca2017/home Cultural Analytics symposium],” Notre Dame University, May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a four-month long research program at UCLA that brought together 120 leading researchers from university and industry labs,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/culture-analytics/ Culture Analytics program],” Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA, March 7–June 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; an academic peer-review ''Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA'' established in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalanalytics.org/about/|title=Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic job listings.

===Textual mining, analysis, and visualization===

WordHoard (begun in 2004) is a free application that enables scholarly but non-technical users to read and analyze, in new ways, deeply-tagged texts, including the canon of Early Greek epic, [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. The Republic of Letters (begun in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/novemberdecember/feature/mapping-the-republic-letters|title=Mapping the Republic of Letters|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to visualize the social network of Enlightenment writers through an interactive map and visualization tools. Network analysis and data visualization is also used for reflections on the field itself – researchers may produce network maps of social media interactions or infographics from data on digital humanities scholars and projects.[[File:Digital Humanities on Twitter.png|thumb|Network analysis: graph of Digital Humanities Twitter users]]

===Analysis of macroscopic trends in cultural change===

[[Culturomics]] is a form of [[computational lexicology]] that studies [[human behavior]] and [[cultural trends]] through the [[Statistics|quantitative analysis]] of digitized texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Patricia | last=Cohen | title=In 500 Billion Words, New Window on Culture | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/books/17words.html | date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Hayes|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.12418,y.2011,no.3,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx|title=Bit Lit|journal=[[American Scientist]]|volume=99|issue=3|page=190|doi=10.1511/2011.90.190|date=May–June 2011|access-date=2017-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018204747/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.12418,y.2011,no.3,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers [[data mining|data mine]] large [[digital archive]]s to investigate cultural phenomena reflected in language and word usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.amhighed.com/documents/charleston2011/AIHE2011_Proceedings.pdf#page=228 | first=David W. |last=Letcher | title=Cultoromics: A New Way to See Temporal Changes in the Prevalence of Words and Phrases | journal=American Institute of Higher Education 6th International Conference Proceedings | volume=4 | issue=1 | page=228 | date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is an American [[neologism]] first described in a 2010 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article called ''Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books'', co-authored by Harvard researchers Jean-Baptiste Michel and [[Erez Lieberman Aiden]].&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Jean-Baptiste | last1=Michel | first2=Erez | last2=Liberman Aiden | title=Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=16 December 2010 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/15/science.1199644 | doi=10.1126/science.1199644 | pmid=21163965 | volume=331 | issue=6014 | pmc=3279742 | pages=176–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study&lt;ref name="Lansdall-Welfare 201606380"/&gt; published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] compared the trajectory of n-grams over time in both digitised books from the 2010 [[Science (journal)|Science]] article&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt; with those found in a large corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom over the course of 150 years. The study further went on to use more advanced [[Natural language processing]] techniques to discover macroscopic trends in history and culture, including gender bias, geographical focus, technology, and politics, along with accurate dates for specific events.

===Online publishing===

The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (begun in 1995) is a dynamic reference work of terms, concepts, and people from philosophy maintained by scholars in the field. [https://mla.hcommons.org/ MLA Commons] offers an open peer-review site (where anyone can comment) for their ongoing curated collection of teaching artifacts in ''[https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/ Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments]'' (2016). The ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' platform contains volumes of the open-access book of the same title (2012 and 2016 editions) and allows readers to interact with material by marking sentences as interesting or adding terms to a crowdsourced index.

==Criticism==
Lauren F. Klein and Matthew K. Gold have identified a range of criticisms in the digital humanities field: "'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities".&lt;ref name="dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Berry and Fagerjord have argued that a digital humanities should "focus on the need to think critically about the implications of computational imaginaries, and raise some questions in this regard. This is also to foreground the importance of the politics and norms that are embedded in digital technology, algorithms and software. We need to explore how to negotiate between close and distant readings of texts and how micro-analysis and macro-analysis can be usefully reconciled in humanist work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Liu has argued, "while digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically, therefore (e.g., debating the ‘ordered hierarchy of content objects’ principle; disputing whether computation is best used for truth finding or, as Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann put it, ‘deformance’; and so on) rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these concerns have given rise to the emergent subfield of Critical Digital Humanities (CDH): &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some key questions include: how do we make the invisible become visible in the study of software? How is knowledge transformed when mediated through code and software? What are the critical approaches to Big Data, visualization, digital methods, etc.? How does computation create new disciplinary boundaries and gate-keeping functions? What are the new hegemonic representations of the digital – ‘geons’, ‘pixels’, ‘waves’, visualization, visual rhetorics, etc.? How do media changes create epistemic changes, and how can we look behind the ‘screen essentialism’ of computational interfaces? Here we might also reflect on the way in which the practice of making- visible also entails the making-invisible – computation involves making choices about what is to be captured. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Negative publicity===

Klein and Gold note that many appearances of the digital humanities in public media are often in a critical fashion. Armand Leroi, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', discusses the contrast between the algorithmic analysis of themes in literary texts and the work of Harold Bloom, who qualitatively and phenomenologically analyzes the themes of literature over time. Leroi questions whether or not the digital humanities can provide a truly robust analysis of literature and social phenomenon or offer a novel alternative perspective on them. The literary theorist [[Stanley Fish]] claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of "pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power."&lt;ref name="fish-mortality"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/|title=The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality|last=Fish|first=Stanley|date=2012-01-09|work=The New York Times|location=New York|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, digital humanities scholars note that "Digital Humanities is an extension of traditional knowledge skills and methods, not a replacement for them. Its distinctive contributions do not obliterate the insights of the past, but add and supplement the humanities' long-standing commitment to scholarly interpretation, informed research, structured argument, and dialogue within communities of practice".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some have hailed the digital humanities as a solution to the apparent problems within the humanities, namely a decline in funding, a repeat of debates, and a fading set of theoretical claims and methodological arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leroi|first1=Armand|title=Digitizing the Humanities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/opinion/digitizing-the-humanities.html|website=The New York Times Online|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Kirsch, writing in the ''New Republic'', calls this the "False Promise" of the digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsch|first1=Adam|title=Technology Is Taking Over English Departments|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch|website=The New Republic|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the rest of humanities and many social science departments are seeing a decline in funding or prestige, the digital humanities has been seeing increasing funding and prestige.  Burdened with the problems of novelty, the digital humanities is discussed as either a revolutionary alternative to the humanities as it is usually conceived or as simply new wine in old bottles. Kirsch believes that digital humanities practitioners suffer from problems of being marketers rather than scholars, who attest to the grand capacity of their research more than actually performing new analysis and when they do so, only performing trivial parlor tricks of research. This form of criticism has been repeated by others, such as in Carl Staumshein, writing in ''Inside Higher Education'', who calls it a "Digital Humanities Bubble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities Bubble|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/08/digital-humanities-wont-save-humanities-digital-humanists-say|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same publication, Straumshein alleges that the digital humanities is a 'Corporatist Restructuring' of the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities as 'Corporatist Restructuring'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/06/article-criticizes-impact-digital-humanities-colleges|website=Inside Higher Education|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the alliance of the digital humanities with business to be a positive turn that causes the business world to pay more attention, thus bringing needed funding and attention to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Tracy|title=Humanities and business go hand in hand|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/04/24/humanities-and-business-hand-hand/9nG9n04SSF1Ko0MRJjguxK/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were not burdened by the title of digital humanities, it could escape the allegations that it is elitist and unfairly funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pannapacker|first1=William|title=Stop Calling It 'Digital Humanities'|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Calling-It-Digital/137325/|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black box===

There has also been critique of the use of digital humanities tools by scholars who do not fully understand what happens to the data they input and place too much trust in the "black box" of software that cannot be sufficiently examined for errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dobson|first=James E.|title=Can an Algorithm be Disturbed? Machine Learning, Intrinsic Criticism, and the Digital Humanities|year=2015|periodical=College Literature |volume=42|issue=4 |pages= 543–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johanna Drucker]], a professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Department of Information Studies, has criticized the "epistemological fallacies" prevalent in popular visualization tools and technologies (such as [[Google]]'s n-gram graph) used by digital humanities scholars and the general public, calling some network diagramming and topic modeling tools "just too crude for humanistic work."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/140307034|title=Johanna Drucker (UCLA) Lecture, "Should Humanists Visualize Knowledge?"|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of transparency in these programs obscures the subjective nature of the data and its processing, she argues, as these programs "generate standard diagrams based on conventional algorithms for screen display...mak[ing] it very difficult for the semantics of the data processing to be made evident."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt;

===Diversity===

There has also been some recent controversy among practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of [[Unix|UNIX]] and computers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|title=Open Thread: The Digital Humanities as a Historical "Refuge" from Race/Class/Gender/Sexuality/Disability?|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021953/http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson posits that there needs to be an understanding and theorizing of the implications of digital technology and race, even when the subject for analysis appears not to be about race.

Amy E. Earhart criticizes what has become the new digital humanities "canon" in the shift from websites using simple [[HTML]] to the usage of the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] and visuals in textual recovery projects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/16|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Works that has been previously lost or excluded were afforded a new home on the internet, but much of the same marginalizing practices found in traditional humanities also took place digitally. According to Earhart, there is a "need to examine the canon that we, as digital humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward traditional texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Issues of access===

Practitioners in digital humanities are also failing to meet the needs of users with disabilities. George H. Williams argues that universal design is imperative for practitioners to increase usability because "many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources are useless for people who are—for example—deaf or hard of hearing, as well as for people who are blind, have low vision, or have difficulty distinguishing particular colors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44|title=Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities|work=Debates in the Digital Humanities |author=George H. Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide accessibility successfully, and productive universal design, it is important to understand why and how users with disabilities are using the digital resources while remembering that all users approach their informational needs differently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Cultural criticism===

Digital humanities have been criticized for not only ignoring traditional questions of lineage and history in the humanities, but lacking the fundamental cultural criticism that defines the humanities. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the humanities have to be tied to cultural criticism, per se, in order to be the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord/&gt; The sciences{{vague|date=June 2017}} might imagine the Digital Humanities as a welcome improvement over the non-quantitative methods of the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Poetry in Motion'|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474420b.html|website=Nature|publisher=Nature|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirschenbaum|first1=Matthew|url=https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dhterriblethingskirschenbaum.pdf|website=Wordpress|publisher=Matthew Kirschenbaum|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=What Is "Digital Humanities," and Why Are They Saying Such Terrible Things about It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty of evaluation===

As the field matures, there has been a recognition that the standard model of academic peer-review of work may not be adequate for digital humanities projects, which often involve website components, databases, and other non-print objects. Evaluation of quality and impact thus require a combination of old and new methods of peer review.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One response has been the creation of the ''DHCommons Journal''. This accepts non-traditional submissions, especially mid-stage digital projects, and provides an innovative model of peer review more suited for the multimedia, transdisciplinary, and milestone-driven nature of Digital Humanities projects. Other professional humanities organizations, such as the [[American Historical Association]] and the [[Modern Language Association]], have developed guidelines for evaluating academic digital scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media|title=Guidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and Digital...|website=Modern Language Association|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians|title=Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of focus on pedagogy===

The 2012 edition of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' recognized the fact that pedagogy was the “neglected ‘stepchild’ of DH” and included an entire section on teaching the digital humanities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Part of the reason is that grants in the humanities are geared more toward research with quantifiable results rather than teaching innovations, which are harder to measure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In recognition of a need for more scholarship on the area of teaching, ''Digital Humanities Pedagogy'' was published and offered case studies and strategies to address how to teach digital humanities methods in various disciplines.

==Organizations==

The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) is an umbrella organization that supports digital research and teaching as a consultative and advisory force for its constituent organizations. Its governance was approved in 2005 and it has overseen the annual [[Digital Humanities conference]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adho.org/about|title=About {{!}} ADHO|website=adho.org|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current members of ADHO are:

'''Electrical engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics &amp; waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised [[units of measure]]. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell’s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at [[University of Missouri]] soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.missouri.edu/ece/about/department-history/|title=Department History - Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780801873973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780883855706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920, [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albert W.

===Solid-state electronics ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor.]]
The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and [[personal computer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main article|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main article|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&amp;nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
{{Main article|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images, and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.

[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=corp_level1&amp;path=education/faqs&amp;file=faqs1.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending on the university. The [[bachelor's degree]] generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]], and a [[list of electrical engineering topics|variety of topics in electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="Enterprise1986"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVHbRM6mU9gC&amp;pg=PA97|date=25 August 1986|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|An example [[circuit diagram]]. It is used as a powerful tool in [[troubleshooting]]. ]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055044/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html |date=16 January 2006 }}, study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicing engineers==
[[File:Belgium. Belgian electrical engineers Georges Jean L. Van Antro, left, Georges H. Marchal, center, and Jacques de... - NARA - 541661.tif|thumb|right|Belgian electrical engineers inspecting the rotor of a 40,000 kilowatt [[turbine]] of the [[General Electric Company]] in New York City]]
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].&lt;ref name="Labor2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|&lt;span id="demographics_back"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]], or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |accessdate=16 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |archivedate=13 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (see )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7747">'''Enrique Leff''' (born [[Mexico]], 1946) is a Mexican economist, who defines himself today as an [[environmental sociologist]] and [[environmentalist]]. He has written 25 books and 180 articles on [[political ecology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[environmental economics]], [[environmental epistemology]] and [[environmental education]]. He is regarded as one of the key environmental thinkers in Latin America.

==Background==
After a degree in chemical engineering from UNAM ([[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]) in 1968. Leff graduated with a Doctorat de Troisième Cycle in development economics from the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], Paris, in 1975.

Leff lectured at [[UNAM]] (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) full-time from 1973-1986 before becoming coordinator of the Environmental Training Network for Latin America and the Caribbean (1986-2008) and coordinator of the Mexico City office of the Regional Office of Latin America and the Caribbean of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (2007-2008).

In 2008 he returned full-time as professor of political ecology and environmental politics at UNAM. He is also senior researcher at the Institute of Social Research (Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales) at the same university.

Leff works in Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. In addition to academic work he is an accomplished opera, Lieder and bolero singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablemusic.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/sustainability-unbound-5-political.html|title=Sustainable Music: Sustainability Unbound (5): Political Ecology|first=Jeff Todd|last=Titon|date=23 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a Masters in Voice from the Manhattan School of Music (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musica.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=522:recital-de-enrique-leff-y-tonatiuh-de-la-sierra-en-el-ciclo-de-ma-de-cra&amp;Itemid=180|title=INICIO|first=DAR -|last=LabCitrico|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Leff works in the academic fields of epistemology, environmental economics, environmental sociology, [[political ecology]], and [[environmental education]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cep.unt.edu/papers/leff-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for arguing that environmental problems result from a crisis of Western civilization's ways of knowing, understanding and transforming the world (Eschenhagen 2012). This masks other legitimate ways of thinking and acting in the world, namely forms of 'eco-development' and environmental rationality. His work is largely theoretical but his major books cite positive examples of the [[ethnobotanic]] practices of [[Pre-Columbian era|Prehispanic cultures]] in Latin America, sustainable agricultural practices in tropical ecosystems, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxCGZhGUEbk TED talk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In computing, an '''exclusive relationship''' is a type of [[Relational model|Relationship]] in [[computer]] [[data base]] design.

In Relational Database Design, in some cases the existence of one kind of relationship type precludes the existence of another. Entities within an entity type A may be related by a relationship type R to an entity in entity type B or entity type C but not both. The relationship types are said to be mutually exclusive. Usually both relationship types will have the same name.

==Example==

A Data (Entity A) could be Sent (Relationship Name) to a Monitor (Entity B) or a Printer(Entity C) to be shown. In this case the relationship between the Monitor and Printer at one side and Data at the other side is an Exclusive Relationship. Of course it is assumed that Data could be sent to only one of the targets at a time, not to both.

      --- Sent_To ---&gt; Monitor
  Data 
      --- Sent_To ---&gt; Printer

The '''GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences''' headquartered in [[Mannheim]] with a location in [[Cologne]] is the largest German infrastructure institute for the [[social sciences]]. With basic research-based services and consulting covering all levels of the scientific process, GESIS supports researchers in the social sciences. As of 2017, the president of GESIS is Christof Wolf.

GESIS is part of the [[Leibniz Association]] and receives federal and state funding.

== History ==
Established in 1986 as ''German Social Science Infrastructure Services'' (German: "Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen"), GESIS originally consisted of the three independent institutes Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim.

In 2007 the three GESIS institutes merged into one. In November 2008 GESIS added "Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences" to its name in order to emphasize its membership in the Leibniz Association.

In November 2011, GESIS Bonn and Cologne were merged into one location in Cologne.

== Services ==
The GESIS social science services available to support the work of researchers are aligned to the five phases of the research data cycle.

'''Glendon College''' ({{lang-fr|Collège universitaire Glendon}}) is a federated campus of [[York University]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. An internationally oriented, [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] [[liberal arts college]] with 84 full-time faculty members and a student population of about 2,700, Glendon is located in midtown Toronto's [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] neighbourhood.
The college was founded as the first permanent establishment of [[York University]] when it began academic operation under the mentorship of the [[University of Toronto]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedland|first1=Martin|title=The University of Toronto: A History|date=2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442615366|pages=410, 438, 443|edition=illustrated, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''York University Act 1959'' legislation, York was once an affiliated institution of the University of Toronto, where the first cohort of faculty and students originally utilized the Falconer Hall building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/about/law-school-buildings|title=Law School Buildings - University of Toronto Faculty of Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/YorkPhaseOne.htm|title=YorkPhaseOne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a temporary home before relocating north of the [[University of Toronto|St. George]] campus to Glendon Hall &amp;mdash; an estate that was willed by [[E.R. Wood]] for post-secondary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/GlendonHall.htm|title=Glendon Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, a landlot grant was offered by the Province of Ontario to build a new [[York University|campus]], which eventually ceased the bilateral partnership between the two institutions. York University became an independent institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/phasethreeKeele.htm|title=phase three Keele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Glendon refused to transfer to [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele]], as the University of Toronto had no interest in reacquiring or maintaining the donated Wood property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietropaolo|first1=Vicenzo|last2=Horn|first2=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, 2009. Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|edition=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Murray G. Ross]] and diplomat [[Escott Reid]], who mutually proposed a novel plan for the college to educate students for fields in [[civil service]], [[governance]] and [[academia]], were appointed president and principal in 1959 and 1965, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APhWY8BRgWkC|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|first=Michiel|last=Horn|date=11 December 2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, the college was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] with the objective for Glendon to become a fully bilingual institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/about/english/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030231857/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/about/english/history.php |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.yorku.ca/yul-88244/york-university-glendon-college-opening|title=The Right Honourable, Lester B.

A 2012 report on the state of French-language education in Ontario identified Glendon College as having an important role to play in the proposed future creation of a fully independent French-language university in the province, but noted that the college would need greater independence from York University to facilitate its participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csfontario.ca/en/articles/189 "Investigation Report – The State of French-Language Postsecondary Education in Central-Southwestern Ontario: No access, no future"]. Office of the French Language Services Commissioner, June 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bilingualism ==
Glendon's undergraduate curriculum emphasizes languages, international affairs and public policy. Due to this, Glendon was recently granted $20 million by the Government of Ontario in order to become the country's first "Centre of Excellence
for French language and Bilingual Postsecondary Education," in collaboration with [[Collège Boréal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/nr/08.02/nr0227.html Ontario Invests In New Centre For French-Language Education At York University], News Release 27 February 2008, Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hume|first1=Christopher|title=Glendon College and the 21st-century campus: Christopher Hume|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/09/28/glendon_college_and_the_21stcentury_campus_christopher_hume.html|accessdate=11 March 2013|publisher=Toronto Star|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language skill assessments are given to new students to determine the level needed to take to fulfill Glendon's second-language requirement. Students who attain higher levels can either take advanced-level language instruction in their second language, or a discipline course taught solely in their second language.

In addition, a variety of non-credit classes and programmes are offered by the college to students, faculty and the general public including introductory courses in foreign languages ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Cantonese]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]); indigenous languages in [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]]; and professional development courses in English and French. Students also have the opportunity to take other language courses available through the Languages, Literature and Linguistics department at York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/laps/dlll/|title=Department of Languages, Literatures &amp; Linguistics - Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This bilingual approach to university education is said to be unique in Canada, because all students within Glendon College receive education in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. Canada's other bilingual post-secondary institutions, including portions of [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]], [[Laurentian University]], [[University of Alberta]] ([[University of Alberta Faculté Saint-Jean|Faculté St-Jean]]), and the [[University of Ottawa]], often educate students in one language or the other. Although each one offers students the possibility of a fully bilingual education, Glendon is the only institution in Canada where all [[English language|anglophone]] and [[francophone]] students are required to take at least one compulsory class in their second language, regardless of their initial ability in the language. As a result, [[code-switching]] is relatively common among students on campus. At the end of their undergraduate studies, all students will demonstrate an intermediate level (minimum) of proficiency in their second language.

Glendon College was recently designated an institution offering French services under the [[French Language Services Act]], at the request of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/tcu/en/2016/03/ontario-strengthens-french-language-services-at-york-university.html|title=Ontario Strengthens French-Language Services at York University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is a discussion around the establishment of an all-French university in Ontario, one that would be larger than the [[Université de Hearst]] and could conceivably be a multi-campus university serving several regions in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/french-university-ontario-1.3452119|title=Students push for French University, and Queen's Park is going to hear about it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesudburystar.com/2016/02/19/sudbury-support-for-french-university|title=Sudbury support for French university|first=|last=nurun.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some data suggest that Franco-Ontarian participation rates in university are comparable to that of English speakers, obviating the need for a French-language university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/ontario-doesnt-need-another-french-university/|title=Ontario doesn't need another French university - Macleans.ca|date=29 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heqco.ca/en-ca/Research/ResPub/Pages/Issue-Paper-No-17-Informing-policy-through-analysis-of-current-research.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degrees ==
Glendon is a primarily undergraduate institution where academics are rooted in York's liberal arts and professional studies program, although the college mainly specializes in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. Glendon offers 21 undergraduate degree (BA) and 18 [[International education|international]] Bachelor of Arts concentrations. Glendon has a unique concurrent and consecutive Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) focused specifically on preparing teachers for French immersion, extended French and core French teaching positions in anglophone schools. Glendon has recently initiated its first BSc/iBSc degrees, in psychology and biology and its first ever business administration and international studies dual degree (BBA/iBA) in partnership with the [[EMLYON Business School]], along with a new BA/iBA degree in communications.

There are also concurrent/consecutive certificate programs in a variety of fields (teaching English as an international language (D-TEIL), law and social thought, rédaction professionnelle (offered in French only), refugee and migration studies, sexuality studies, Spanish/English – English-Spanish translation, and technical and professional communication).

Since its inception in the early 1960s, the college has grown to also include a graduate school offering master's programs in French studies (M.A.), public and international affairs (M.P.I.A.), translation studies (M.A.) and conference interpretation (M.C.I.). The translation and interpreting masters build on the college's strength in languages while the public and international affairs degree is affiliated with the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs. There is also a doctoral degree in francophone studies (Ph.D.).

Any student attending Glendon can enroll in up to 50 per cent of his or her classes at the larger Keele campus, and vice versa. This policy is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while maintaining the qualities and features of a small college.

== Student life ==
Mirroring the campus life of small-scale American institutions like [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] and [[Williams College|Williams]], Glendon has a tight-knit community within the larger student population of their sister campus. Various campus events are organized by the Glendon College Student Union/l'Association Étudiante du Collège Glendon (GCSU/AÉCG) and its membership includes all students enrolled in courses at Glendon College and elects a council to represent them. Students can join and access a number of clubs and organizations on both of the campuses. Glendon has a newspaper (''Pro Tem''), York University's premier and longest student-run campus publication that is published in both English and French; a [[campus radio]] station ([[Radio Glendon]]); the Grand Rassemblement de l’Éducation en Français (GREF): Glendon's French language publishing house; and a [[black box theatre]] company, Theatre Glendon/Théâtre Glendon, in addition to similar media from [[York University]], of which Glendon is formally a part.

Other facilities exist for students, such as a student lounge, a cafeteria, campus gym memberships, workshops, IT services, and a liaison office for prospective students. The college also encourages students to utilize the academic resources on both campuses. The college's proximity to [[Yonge and Eglinton]] and [[Downtown Toronto]] makes its location ideal for students who want to partake in the city's diverse array of social and cultural attractions. Glendon College is also where the first issue of the ''[[Toronto Special]]'' newspaper was published, according to the ''[[National Post]]''. The Salon Francophone, situated in the main building, is a social resource centre and a club, which organizes multiple activities to promote the French language.

Glendon was initially planned on being a [[residential college]] where students were required to live on campus, however, over the past couple of decades the increase in students outnumbered the available residential spaces. Therefore, the majority of students commute, while only around 400 students live on campus. Glendon's international profile attracts students from over 100 countries, in particular, a significant number of [[francophone]] students from across Canada (notably [[Quebec]]) and around the world, including [[France]], [[Haiti]], [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]], and [[Algeria]]. Approximately 1/3 of the student population are francophone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/futurestudents/academic-programs/the-bilingual-requirement/sociallybilingual/|title=Learning French Beyond the Classroom - Future Students|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Glendon has a visible [[hispanophone]] presence with more than 20% studying [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a third language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/hispanicstudies/more.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130192645/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/hispanicstudies/more.php |archivedate=2015-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Resource Centre library at Glendon is a joint initiative between the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Government of Spain]] and the Hispanic studies department of [[York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myglendon.yorku.ca/monglendon.nsf/a7e65f88702320d28525734f00011f74/3412bbdf594ae7f785257515004983ed?OpenDocument|title=GLENDON - Spanish Resource Centre Reopens at Glendon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
Glendon occupies the former country estate of [[Edward Rogers Wood]], a prominent Toronto financier and philanthropist of the early 1900s. The estate was built in 1924 and is located at the intersection of Bayview and Lawrence Ave. between the neighbourhoods of [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] and [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]]. The estate was the original York University campus when it was bequeathed by the [[University of Toronto]], and it remained a [[liberal arts college]] when York's [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele campus]] was inaugurated in 1966. The college is formally one of York's 9 colleges and 11 faculties, and is considered semi-autonomous within York University. Glendon's founder and first principal was Canadian diplomat [[Escott Reid]] who foresaw the institution's key mandate to educate future leaders of Canada in both official languages. Historically, the manor served as a temporary home for the [[OCAD University|Ontario College of Art]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocadu.ca/Assets/PDF_MEDIA/Dorothy+H.+Hoover+Library/HistoryOCADLibrary.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Toronto]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|page=28|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the natural landscape of the 85-acre estate was used as an [[arboretum]] by the [[botany]] and [[forestry]] department at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|pages=27, 29|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the college is the institutional home of the Glendon School of Public &amp; International Affairs, the first bilingual graduate school in Canada to offer a MPIA, in collaboration with ''The Global Brief'', Canada's top [[international affairs]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yorku.ca/2009/09/15/global-brief-finds-new-home-at-york-u%E2%80%99s-glendon-college/|title=Global Brief finds new home at York U’s Glendon College - York Media Relations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduate school also operates an interdisciplinary research institute for public policy &amp;mdash; the [[Centre for Global Challenges]].  The Faculty of Graduate Studies also manages a [[doctoral|PhD]] program and three other distinct [[Master's degree|MA]] programs. The Centre of Excellence for French language and Bilingual Post-secondary Education is Glendon's recent expansion and was created to accommodate the growth of incoming students and the increasing demand for multilingual post-secondary education in Southern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/centreofexcellence/english/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924083935/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/centreofexcellence/english/ |archivedate=2014-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus has also played host to several productions, namely ''[[American Psycho 2: All American Girl]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife (film)|The Time Traveler's Wife]]''(2009), which were extensively filmed in and around Glendon. Hedley also filmed their Lost in Translation music video at Glendon. Often, students are incorporated into shooting when the campus is sealed off for the weekends.

=== Buildings and abbreviations ===
*'''York Hall (YH) / Pavillon York;''' the main building, shaped like an 'h', divided into four sections (the main wing, and the "A", "B", and "C" wings). York Hall has two large lecture halls (one located in the Penthouse; the other in the Center of Excellence), and houses smaller classrooms; departmental and professors' offices; the bookstore; the Rejean Garneau laboratory; the circular senate chamber; the theatre; as well as the school's cafeteria and dining hall. The renovated expansion within "B" Wing&amp;mdash;a space enclosed with full-size glass windows housing Glendon Recruitment and Liaison, the office of the student union, dedicated club space, the Salon Francophone, as well as a spacious{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} social common area (to replace the former Salon Garigue lounge). ''' The Centre of Excellence (GCE) / Le Centre d'Éxcellence''' is the latest extension to the existing "A" Wing of York Hall. The glass box building was designed by Montréal architect, Renée Daoust, and houses an amphitheatre, a studio, language labs, offices and additional commons space.
*'''Glendon Hall (GH) / Manoir Glendon;''' originally the [[Italianate]] [[villa]] where the Edward R Wood family resided (his brother [[Frank Porter Wood]] lived next door, where the [[Crescent School (Toronto)|Crescent School]] is now located). Today it has two classrooms; an all-purpose room now known as The [[Bank of Montreal|Bank of Montreal (BMO) Conference Centre]]; the CKRG campus radio station; the Career and Counselling Centre; Glendon's administrative faculty offices (including that of the principal); the Glendon Gallery/Galerie Glendon; the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/gspia/|title=The Glendon School of Public and International Affairs - Glendon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Lunik Café &amp;mdash; a student-run cooperative that opened in September 2011. It is known informally as "The Manor."
[[File:Rose garden 2.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rose Garden, with Wood Residence visible in the background.]]
*'''Leslie Frost Library (FL) / Bibliothèque Frost;''' a library (with a collection of over 300,000 items) that is open to all [[York University|York]] students. It opened in 1963 and is named after [[Leslie Frost]], the late [[Premier of Ontario]] and graduate of [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]. The library features a computer lab, study rooms, and quiet reading spaces available for student use. Adjacent to the library is the Bruce Bryden Rose Garden, a rare and well-preserved example of British [[English landscape garden|landscaping]], with characteristics of Victorian &amp; Edwardian influences.
*'''Proctor Field House (PFH) / Pavillon Proctor;''' the campus athletics building housing the Glendon Athletic Club (GAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glendon.yorku.ca/QuickPlace/proctor/Main.nsf/h_Toc/4c037182774c316f85256fe20065b8f8/?OpenDocument|title=Glendon - Glendon Campus|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208032424/http://glendon.yorku.ca/QuickPlace/proctor/Main.nsf/h_Toc/4c037182774c316f85256fe20065b8f8/?OpenDocument|archivedate=2008-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glendon Athletic Club offers full gym facilities to students and the public, including a weight room, a cardio room, a pool, tennis and squash courts, an instructional studio, and a gymnasium. Proctor also holds group exercise programs such as spinning classes, yoga, martial arts, and dance lessons. Glendon students enjoy a generous discount for gym membership throughout the academic year. In 1995, Proctor Field House served as the Raptors' practice facility.
*'''Hilliard Residence (HR) / Résidence Hilliard;''' a 215-room residence building, named after famed obstetrician Marion Hilliard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/about-us/our-history/our-pioneers/dr-marion-hilliard|title=Women's College Hospital - Who Was Dr. Marion Hilliard?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=403 Marion Hilliard], Profile, science.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Students are divided between 6 dormitory-style houses (A, B, C, E, F, and G, respectively). With the exception of D-house, which is used for some professors' offices and classroom space, and G-house, which has suite-style rooms for upper-year students. A house can hold as many as 40 students. Each house is under the charge of a resident "don", as well as Residence Life Assistants (RLAs) that oversee activities in both residence buildings. Differing from the Wood Residence, each of Hilliard's houses do not exceed a single floor in reach, with two houses per floor. Hilliard also contains the offices of ''Pro Tem'', the Women &amp; Trans Centre and Theatre Glendon storage space in Hilliard's non-residential houses, D and H. The basement of Hilliard Residence contains a recreational room, available for all members of the residence.
*'''Wood Residence (WR) / Résidence Wood;''' a 189-room residence building. It houses students in typical dormitory-style rooms. Wood is the smaller of the two residences&amp;mdash;there are only 22–30 students per house (section of the building). Students are divided into five houses A through E; each house spans three floors with a single shared common room on the ground floor. Changes in Residence Life programming have led to the creation of a "Quiet Floor" in the basement of B-house for students who wish to enjoy an extension of the regular late-night quiet hours when all residents must avoid inappropriately loud noises. As well, the entirety of C House will become "Green" for students who wish to enjoy a more environmentally friendly lifestyle within residence.
*'''Greenhouse (GR) / La Serre;''' The Greenhouse was the Woods' old greenhouse, primarily under the care of Agnes Euphemia Smart, the widow of Mr. Wood. It is now used for the Security, Parking and Transportation Services offices, Housing and Residence services offices, as well as the campus goSAFE student escort service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/gosafe/gosafe.html|title=goSAFE Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, students visit the Greenhouse to resolve security and campus fine issues, or for residence related issues such as keys/keycards, tax-exempt stickers for the cafeteria or any maintenance or service required in residence.

A '''Gödel machine''' is a theoretical self-improving [[computer program]] that solves problems in an optimal way.{{clarify|date=June 2017}} It uses a recursive self-improvement protocol in which it rewrites its own code when it can prove the new code provides a better strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Universal Transfer Learning |last=Mahmud |first=M. M. Hassan |pages=16–18 |year=2008 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |isbn=9780549909880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Michael L. |author2=Tim Oates |date=Spring 2007 |title= A review of recent research in metareasoning and metalearning  |journal=[[AI Magazine]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=7 | url = https://vvvvw.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2025/1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was invented by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (first proposed in 2003&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;), but is named after [[Kurt Gödel]] who inspired the mathematical theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gödel machine|url=http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/G%C3%B6del_machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel machine is often discussed when dealing with issues of [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta-learning]], also known as "learning to learn." Applications include automating human design decisions and transfer of knowledge between multiple related tasks, and may lead to design of more robust and general learning architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schaul|first1=Tom|last2=Schmidhuber|first2=Juergen|title=Metalearning|url=http://scholarpedia.org/article/Metalearning|website=Scholarpedia|accessdate=10 November 2014|pages=4650|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.4650|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though theoretically possible, no full implementation has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_29#page-2 |title= A Family of Gödel Machine Implementations |accessdate=13 November 2014|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_29|pages=275–280|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel machine is often compared with [[Marcus Hutter]]'s [[AIXI]]tl, another formal specification for an [[artificial general intelligence]]. Schmidhuber points out that the Gödel machine could start out by implementing AIXItl as its initial sub-program, and self-modify after it finds proof that another algorithm for its search code will be better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ultimatecognition.pdf|website=Cognitive Computation|accessdate=13 November 2014|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Traditional problems solved by a computer only require one input and provide some output. Computers of this sort had their initial algorithm hardwired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ultimatecognition.pdf|website=Cognitive Computation|accessdate=13 November 2014|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doesn't take into account the dynamic natural environment, and thus was a goal for the Gödel machine to overcome.

The Gödel machine has limitations of its own, however. Any formal system that encompasses arithmetic is either flawed or allows for unprovable but true statements.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Gödel Machines: Self-Referential ¨ Universal Problem Solvers Making Provably Optimal Self-Improvements|date=December 2006|url=ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/gm6.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence even a Gödel machine with unlimited computational resources must ignore those self-improvements whose effectiveness it cannot prove.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

==Variables of interest==

{{Confusing|Section|date=September 2017}}

There are three variables that are particularly useful in the run time of the Gödel machine.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

* At some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the variable &lt;math&gt;time&lt;/math&gt; will have the binary equivalent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This is incremented steadily throughout the run time of the machine.

* Any [[input (computer science)|input]] meant for the Gödel machine from the natural environment is stored in variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. It is likely the case that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will hold different values for different values of variable &lt;math&gt;time&lt;/math&gt;.

* The outputs of the Gödel machine are stored in variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; would be the output bit-string at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

At any given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(1 \leq t \leq T)&lt;/math&gt;, the goal is to maximize future success or utility. A typical ''utility function'' follows the pattern &lt;math&gt;u(s, Env) : S \times E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;u(s, Env) = E_\mu \Bigg[ \sum_{\tau=time}^T r(\tau) \mid s, Env \Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued reward input (encoded within &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;) at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_\mu [ \cdot \mid \cdot ]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the
conditional expectation operator with respect to some possibly unknown distribution &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; from a
set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of possible distributions (&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; reflects whatever is known about the possibly probabilistic
reactions of the environment), and the above-mentioned &lt;math&gt;time = time(s)&lt;/math&gt; is a function of state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; which uniquely identifies the current cycle &lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."/&gt;. Note that we take into account the possibility of extending the expected lifespan through appropriate actions &lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."/&gt;.

{{Clear}}

==Instructions used by proof techniques==

{{Confusing|Section|date=September 2017}}

The nature of the six proof-modifying instructions below makes it impossible
to insert an incorrect theorem into proof, thus trivializing proof verification.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

===get-axiom(n)===

Appends the n-th [[axiom]] as a theorem to the current theorem sequence. Below is the initial axiom scheme:

* '''Hardware Axioms''' formally specify how components of the machine could change from one cycle to the next.
* '''Reward Axioms''' define the [[computational cost]] of hardware instruction and the physical cost of output actions. Related Axioms also define the lifetime of the Gödel machine as [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] quantities representing all rewards/costs.
* '''Environment Axioms''' restrict the way new inputs ''x'' are produced from the environment, based on previous sequences of inputs ''y''.
* '''Uncertainty Axioms/String Manipulation Axioms''' are standard axioms for arithmetic, calculus, [[probability theory]], and string manipulation that allow for the construction of proofs related to future variable values within the Gödel machine.
* '''Initial State Axioms''' contain information about how to reconstruct parts or all of the initial state.
* '''Utility Axioms''' describe the overall goal in the form of utility function ''u''.

===apply-rule(k, m, n)===

Takes in the index ''k'' of an inference rule (such as [[Modus tollens]], [[Modus ponens]]), and attempts to apply it to the two previously proved theorems ''m'' and ''n''. The resulting theorem is then added to the proof.

===delete-theorem(m)===

Deletes the theorem stored at index ''m'' in the current proof. This helps to mitigate storage constraints caused by redundant and unnecessary theorems. Deleted theorems can no longer be referenced by the above '''''apply-rule''''' function.

===set-switchprog(m, n)===

Replaces ''switchprog'' ''S&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m:n&lt;/sub&gt;'', provided it is a non-empty [[substring]] of ''S&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;''.

===check()===

Verifies whether the goal of the proof search has been reached. A target theorem states
that given the current axiomatized utility function ''u'' (Item 1f), the utility of a switch from
''p'' to the current switchprog would be higher than the utility of continuing the execution of
''p'' (which would keep searching for alternative switchprogs).&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt; This is demonstrated in the below image:

[[File:Equation2.png|thumb|left|Description of the decoded check() function for the Godel Machine]]

{{clear}}

===state2theorem(m, n)===

Takes in two arguments, ''m'' and ''n'', and attempts to convert the contents of ''S&lt;sub&gt;m:n&lt;/sub&gt;'' into a theorem.

==Example applications==

===Time-limited NP-hard optimization===

The initial input to the Gödel machine is the representation of a
connected graph with a large number of [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] linked by
edges of various lengths. Within given time ''T'' it should find
a [[cycle (graph theory)|cyclic]] path connecting all nodes. The only real-valued
reward will occur at time ''T''. It equals 1 divided by the
length of the best path found so far (0 if none was found).
There are no other inputs. The by-product of maximizing
expected reward is to find the shortest path findable within
the limited time, given the initial bias.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

===Fast theorem proving===

Prove or disprove as quickly as possible that all even integer &gt; 2 are the sum of
two primes ([[Goldbach’s conjecture]]). The reward is 1/''t'', where ''t'' is the time required to produce and verify the first
such proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|website=Cognitive Computation|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximizing expected reward with bounded resources===

A [[cognitive]] robot that needs at least 1 [[liter]] of gasoline per hour interacts with a partially unknown
environment, trying to find hidden, limited gasoline depots to occasionally refuel its tank. It is rewarded in proportion
to its lifetime, and dies after at most 100 years or as soon as its tank is empty or it falls off a cliff, and so on.
The [[probabilistic]] environmental reactions are initially unknown but assumed to be sampled from the axiomatized Speed Prior, according to which hard-to-compute environmental reactions are unlikely. This permits a computable strategy for making near-optimal predictions. One by-product of maximizing expected reward is to maximize expected lifetime.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

The '''heat death of the universe''' is a plausible [[ultimate fate of the universe]] in which the [[universe]] has evolved to a state of no [[thermodynamic free energy]] and therefore can no longer sustain processes that increase [[entropy]]. Heat death does not imply any particular [[Thermodynamic temperature#Internal energy at absolute zero|absolute temperature]]; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. In the language of [[physics]], this is when the universe reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] (maximum entropy).

If the topology of the universe is [[Big Freeze|open or flat]], or if [[dark energy]] is a positive [[cosmological constant]] (both of which are consistent with current data), the universe will continue expanding forever, and a heat death is expected to occur,&lt;ref name="DftS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the universe cooling to approach equilibrium at a very low temperature after a very long time period.

The hypothesis of heat death stems from the ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] (Lord Kelvin), who in the 1850s took the [[theory of heat]] as [[mechanical energy]] loss in nature (as embodied in the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.

==Origins of the idea==
The idea of heat death stems from the [[second law of thermodynamics]], of which one version states that entropy tends to increase in an [[isolated system]]. From this, the hypothesis infers that if the universe lasts for a sufficient time, it will [[asymptotically]] approach a state where all [[energy]] is evenly distributed. In other words, according to this hypothesis, there is a tendency in nature to the [[dissipation]] (energy transformation) of [[mechanical energy]] (motion) into [[thermal energy]]; hence, by extrapolation, there exists the view that, in time, the mechanical movement of the universe will run down as work is converted to heat because of the second law.

The conjecture that all bodies in the universe cool off, eventually becoming too cold to support life, seems to have been first put forward by the French astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]] in 1777 in his writings on the history of astronomy and in the ensuing correspondence with [[Voltaire]]. In Bailly's view, all planets have an [[Internal heating|internal heat]] and are now at some particular stage of cooling. [[Jupiter]], for instance, is still too hot for life to arise there for thousands of years, while the [[Moon]] is already too cold. The final state, in this view, is described as one of "equilibrium" in which all motion ceases.&lt;ref&gt;

The idea of heat death as a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics, however, was first proposed in loose terms beginning in 1851 by William Thomson, who theorized further on the mechanical energy loss views of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1824), [[James Joule]] (1843), and [[Rudolf Clausius]] (1850). Thomson's views were then elaborated on more definitively over the next decade by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[William Rankine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===History===
The idea of heat death of the universe derives from discussion of the application of the first two laws of thermodynamics to universal processes. Specifically, in 1851, William Thomson outlined the view, as based on recent experiments on the dynamical [[theory of heat]]: "heat is not a substance, but a dynamical form of mechanical effect, we perceive that there must be an equivalence between mechanical work and heat, as between cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William. (1851). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_dynamical_theory_of_heat.html "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule’s equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault’s Observations on Steam"] Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'', March 1851, and ''[[Philosophical Magazine|Philosophical Magazine IV]]'', 1852. [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|175px|right|thumb|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] originated the idea of universal heat death in 1852.]]

In 1852, Thomson published ''On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy'', in which he outlined the rudiments of the second law of thermodynamics summarized by the view that mechanical motion and the energy used to create that motion will naturally tend to dissipate or run down.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William (1852). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_a_universal_tendency.html "On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy"] ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'' for 19 April 1852, also ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', Oct. 1852. [This version from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. 59, pp. 511.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in this paper, in relation to their application to the age of the [[Sun]] and the dynamics of the universal operation, attracted the likes of William Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz. The three of them were said to have exchanged ideas on this subject.&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Thomson published "On the age of the Sun’s heat", an article in which he reiterated his fundamental beliefs in the indestructibility of energy (the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]) and the universal dissipation of energy (the second law), leading to diffusion of heat, cessation of useful motion ([[work (physics)|work]]), and exhaustion of [[potential energy]] through the material universe, while clarifying his view of the consequences for the universe as a whole. In a key paragraph, Thomson wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The result would inevitably be a state of universal rest and death, if the universe were finite and left to obey existing laws. But it is impossible to conceive a limit to the extent of matter in the universe; and therefore science points rather to an endless progress, through an endless space, of action involving the transformation of [[potential energy]] into [[Work (physics)|palpable motion]] and hence into [[heat]], than to a single finite mechanism, running down like a clock, and stopping for ever.&lt;ref&gt;

In the years to follow both Thomson's 1852 and the 1865 papers, Helmholtz and Rankine both credited Thomson with the idea, but read further into his papers by publishing views stating that Thomson argued that the universe will end in a "''heat death''" (Helmholtz) which will be the "''end of all physical phenomena''" (Rankine).&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Proposals about the final state of the universe depend on the assumptions made about its ultimate fate, and these assumptions have varied considerably over the late 20th century and early 21st century. In a hypothesized [[Shape of the universe|"open" or "flat" universe]] that continues expanding indefinitely, either a heat death or a [[Big Rip]] is expected to eventually occur.&lt;ref name="DftS" /&gt; If the [[cosmological constant]] is zero, the universe will approach absolute zero temperature over a very long timescale. However, if the cosmological constant is [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|positive]], as appears to be the case in recent observations, the temperature will asymptote to a non-zero positive value, and the universe will approach a state of maximum entropy.&lt;ref&gt;

If a Big Rip doesn't happen long before that, the "heat death" situation could be avoided if there is a method or mechanism to regenerate [[hydrogen]] atoms from [[radiation]], [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[zero-point energy]], or other sources so that [[star formation]] and [[heat transfer]] can continue to avoid a gradual running down of the universe due to the conversion of matter into energy and heavier elements in [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar processes]] and the absorption of matter by [[black hole]]s and their subsequent evaporation as [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Future of an expanding universe}}

From the [[Big Bang]] through the present day, [[matter]] and [[dark matter]] in the universe are thought to have been concentrated in [[star]]s, [[galaxies]], and [[galaxy cluster]]s, and are presumed to continue to be so well into the future. Therefore, the universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and objects can do physical work.&lt;ref name="A dying universe"&gt;

Lieb|Lieb]] and [[Jakob Yngvason|Yngvason]] express their opinion as follows: "Despite the fact that most physicists believe in such a nonequilibrium entropy, it has so far proved impossible to define it in a clearly satisfactory way."&lt;ref&gt;

These questions have a certain fascination, but the answers are speculations, and lie beyond the scope of this book."&lt;ref&gt;

A recent analysis of entropy states, "The entropy of a general gravitational field is still not known", and, "gravitational entropy is difficult to quantify". The analysis considers several possible assumptions that would be needed for estimates and suggests that the [[observable universe]] has more entropy than previously thought. This is because the analysis concludes that supermassive black holes are the largest contributor.&lt;ref&gt;

Such a system does not evolve toward a homogeneous equilibrium state. Instead it becomes increasingly structured and heterogeneous as it fragments into subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:SoborulZeitelor3Cucuteni.JPG|thumb|Possible Neolithic tattoo marks depicted on a Pre-[[Cucuteni culture]] clay figure from Romania, c. 4900–4750 BC]]
[[Tattoo]]ing has been practiced across the globe since at least [[Neolithic]] times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ancient and traditional practices==

===China===
Cemeteries throughout the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Xinjiang]] of western [[China]]) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed [[Tarim mummies|several tattooed mummies]] with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;

In ancient [[China]], tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the [[Qing Dynasty]],{{when|date=August 2013}}&lt;!--specifically--&gt; it was common practice to tattoo [[Chinese characters|characters]] such as {{lang|zh|囚}} ("Prisoner") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, [[Slavery in China|slaves]] were also sometimes marked to display ownership.

However, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture.  [[Marco Polo]] wrote of [[Quanzhou]], "Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city". At least three of the main characters {{ndash}} [[Lu Zhishen]], Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) {{ndash}} in the classic novel ''[[Water Margin]]'' are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. [[Wu Song]] was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西門慶) to avenge his brother. In addition, [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend]] claimed the mother of [[Yue Fei]] (a famous [[Song Dynasty|Song]] general) tattooed the words "Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty" ({{lang|zh|精忠報國}}, ''jing zhong bao guo'') down her son's back before he left to join the army.

===Greece and Rome===
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;{{rp|19}} The ancient Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in [[Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria#Classical antiquity|Syria]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=C. P.|title=Stigma: Tattooing and branding in Graeco-Roman antiquity|journal=Journal of Roman Studies|date=1987|volume=77|pages=139–155|doi=10.2307/300578|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/300578|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} According to [[Robert Graves]] in his book ''The Greek Myths'', tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in [[Leviticus]]. The Romans of [[Late Antiquity]] also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|155}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''stizein'' (στίζειν), meaning "to prick," was used for tattooing. Its derivative ''stigma'' (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|142}} During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the verb ''kentein'' (κεντεῖν) replaced ''stizein'', and a variety of new Latin terms replaced ''stigmata'' including ''signa'' "signs," ''characteres'' "stamps," and ''cicatrices'' "scars."&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

===India===

In Southern [[India]], permanent tattoos are called ''pachakuthu''. It was very common in [[South India]], especially [[Tamil Nadu]], before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called ''godna''. Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general [[Hindu]] population of India.

In India, tattoos have many names, including ''tarazwa'', ''gondan'', and ''ungkala''.

Several Indonesian tribes have tattooing in their culture. One notable example is the [[Dayak people]] of Kalimantan in Borneo ([[Bornean traditional tattooing]]). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the [[Mentawai people]], as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajaampatdoberai.com/unique-traditions-in-papua-including-raja-ampat/|title=UNIQUE TRADITIONS IN PAPUA, INCLUDING RAJA AMPAT - Raja Ampat Doberai|website=www.rajaampatdoberai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the [[Jōmon]] or [[Paleolithic]] period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native [[Ainu people|Ainu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodiapanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of World Cultures CD-ROM|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/japan.htm |access-date=10 July 2015 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=Tattoo history: A source book|date=2000|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-890451-06-6|url=http://www.powerhousebooks.com/books/the-tattoo-history-source-book-paperback/|format=Paperback|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the ''[[ukiyo]]'' (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for "dog" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000 /&gt;{{rp|77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of Japanese tattooing|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo_museum/chinese_japanese_tattoos.html|website=vanishingtattoo.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Meiji Japan]], formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in "decent society" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Egypt and Nubia====
Despite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that [[ancient Egypt]]ians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tassie|first=Geoffrey J.|title=Identifying the practice of tattooing in ancient Egypt and Nubia|journal=Papers from the Institute of Archaeology|date=2003|volume=14|pages=85–101|doi=10.5334/pia.200|url=https://doi.org/10.5334/pia.200|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86,89}} It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through [[Nubia]],&lt;ref name=Bianchi1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Bianchi|first=Robert S.|editor-last=Rubin|editor-first=Arnold|title= Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|chapter=Tattoo in ancient Egypt|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|pages=21–28|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and [[Upper Egypt]] as well as Egypt's [[annexation]] of Lower Nubia during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|92}} Archeologist Geoffrey J. Tassie argues that it may be more appropriate to classify tattoo in ancient Egypt and Nubia as part of a larger [[Nile|Nile Valley]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|93}}

The most famous tattooed mummies from this region are Amunet, a priestess of [[Hathor]], and two Hathoric dancers from [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XI]] that were found at [[Deir el-Bahari]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|90}} In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor from [[Cairo]], wrote an article on [[medical tattoo]]ing practices in ancient Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminocorpus.org/bibliotheque/page/8912/#page|title=Archives de l'Anthropologie Criminelle (tome 13 ; 1898) — Page 270|work=criminocorpus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he describes the tattoos on these three mummies and speculates that they may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: "The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic [[pelvic peritonitis]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/researchers-in-museums/2012/12/10/tattooed-mummy-amunet/ Tattooing in Ancient Egypt Part 2: The Mummy of Amunet] by Gemma Angel, on 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian tattooing appears to have been practiced on women exclusively; with the possible exception of one extremely worn [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XII]] [[stele]], there is no artistic or physical evidence that men were tattooed.&lt;ref name=Bianchi1988 /&gt; However, by the [[Kingdom of Kush#Move to Meroë|Meroitic Period]] (300 BCE – 400 CE), it was practiced on Nubian men as well.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|88}}

Accounts of early travelers to ancient Egypt describe the tool used as an uneven number of metal needles attached to a wooden handle.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keimer|first=Louis|title=Remarques sur le Tatouage dans l’Égypte Ancienne|journal=Memoires Presentés à l’Institut D’Égypte|location=Le Caire|publisher=L’institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale|date=1948|language=French|volume=53|pages=55–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copts====
Coptic tattoos often consist of three lines, three dots and two elements, reflecting the [[Trinity]]. The tools used had an odd number of needles to bring luck and good fortune.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|87}} Many [[Copts]] have the [[Coptic cross]] tattooed on the inside of their right arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojoey.blogspot.com/2005/01/coptic-orthodox-tattoo.html |title=Deep Thoughts: Coptic Orthodox Tattoo |publisher=Mojoey.blogspot.com |date=19 January 2005 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|145}} This may have been influenced by a similar practice tattooing religious symbols on the wrists and arms during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|91}}

===Persia===
[[Herodotus|Herodotus']] writings suggest that slaves and prisoners of war were tattooed in Persia during the [[Iran#Classical antiquity|classical era]]. This practice spread from Persia to Greece and then to Rome.&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|146–147,155}}

The most famous depiction of tattooing in [[Persian literature]] goes back 800 years to a tale by [[Rumi]] about a man who is proud to want a lion tattoo but changes his mind once he experiences the pain of the needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persian-tattoo.com/rumi-tattoo-story.html|title=Rumi's Tattoo Story - Persian tattoo designs|first=Payman|last=Hamed|website=www.persian-tattoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'' (the baths), there were ''dallaks'' whose job was to help people wash themselves. This was a notable occupation because apart from helping the customers with washing, they were massage-therapists, dentists, barbers and tattoo artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persian-tattoo.com/history-of-persian-tattoo.html|title=History - Persian tattoo designs|first=Payman|last=Hamed|website=www.persian-tattoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The history of mankind (1896) (14761627334).jpg|thumb|180px|1896 illustration of [[Igorot]] tattoo patterns which are records of war exploits and status]]
Tattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-[[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Hispanic colonization]] of the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]]. Tattooing in the Philippines, to some, were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] resided in north [[Luzon]], especially among the [[Igorot people|Bontoc, Kalinga and Ifugao peoples]]. The [[Visayans]] of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.

Filipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the islands in the late 16th century, and they called the natives ''[[Pintados|Los Pintados]]'' (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.

As Lane Wilcken's ''Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern'' denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs – not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them  a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is ''batok,'' an ancient [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for tattoos was ''tatak,'' extremely similar to the Samoan word ''tatau''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====New Zealand====
{{main|Tā moko}}
The [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]] practised a form of tattooing known as [[tā moko]], traditionally created with chisels.

However, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko taking on European styles amongst Maori. Traditional tā moko was reserved for head area. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.

====Samoa====
The traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the [[pe'a]]. The traditional female tattoo is called the [[malu]]. The word ''tattoo'' is believed to have originated from the Samoan word ''tatau.'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

When the [[Samoan Islands]] were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, "They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in [[tattoos]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[File:Back view Samoan male tatau - photo Thomas Andrew - 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Back view of a [[Samoans|Samoan]] man with tattoos (c. 1890)]]
In Samoa, the tradition of applying [[tattoo]], or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each [[tattoo]] artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special [[tattooing]] comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Traditional Samoan tattooing of the "pe'a", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. [[Tattooing]] was also a very costly procedure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Samoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the [[tattoo]] artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a "pala'ai" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. "Autapulu" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. "Ausogi'aso tele" is a comb used for making thick lines. "Ausogi'aso laititi" is a comb used for making thin lines. "Aumogo" small comb is used for making small marks. "Sausau" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. "Tuluma" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. "Tu'I"  used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Christian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Siberia===
Tattooed mummies dating to c. 500 BC were extracted from [[Pazyryk burials|burial mounds]] on the Ukok plateau during the 1990s. Their tattooing involved animal designs carried out in a [[curvilinear]] style. The Man of [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], a [[Scythian]] chieftain, is tattooed with an extensive and detailed range of fish, monsters and a series of dots that lined up along the spinal column (lumbar region) and around the right ankle.

===Solomon Islands===
Some artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the [[Solomon Islands]] may have been used for tattooing human skin. [[Obsidian]] pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. "They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/issues/235-1611/world "World Roundup"] 2016.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], facial tattoos of the [[Atayal people]] are called ''ptasan''; they are used to demonstrate that an adult man can protect his homeland, and that an adult woman is qualified to weave cloth and perform housekeeping.&lt;ref name="citing.hohayan.net.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citing.hohayan.net.tw/citing_content.asp?id=2725&amp;keyword=%AF%BE%AD%B1|title=紋面|work=臺灣原住民族歷史語言文化大辭典''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan is believed to be the homeland of all the [[Austronesian peoples]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=Robert|title=The prehistory of the Austronesian speaking peoples: a view from language.|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|date=1995|pages=453–510|doi=10.1007/bf02221119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|pages=384 p.|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Filipinos]], [[Indonesians]], [[Polynesians]] and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] peoples, all with strong tattoo traditions. This along with the striking correlation between Austronesian languages and the use of the so-called hand-tapping method suggests that Austronesian peoples inherited their tattooing traditions from their ancestors established in Taiwan or along the southern coast of the Chinese mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robitaille|first1=Benoit|title=A Preliminary Typology of Perpendicularly Hafted Bone Tipped Tattooing Instruments Toward a Technological History of Oceanic Tattooing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286450624_A_Preliminary_Typology_of_Perpendicularly_Hafted_Bone_Tipped_Tattooing_Instruments_Toward_a_Technological_History_of_Oceanic_Tattooing|website=researchgate.net|publisher=BAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
{{main|Yantra tattooing}}
Thai tattoos, also known as Yantra tattooing, was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in [[Tai peoples|Tai]] tribes that were is southern China. Over time, this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a [[Brahmin]] priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the [[Old Mon script|Mon script]] or ancient [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer script]], which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.

===Europe===
The earliest possible evidence for tattooing in Europe appears on ancient art from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period as incised designs on the bodies of humanoid figurines.&lt;ref name=Friedman2015&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Anna Felicity|title=The world atlas of tattoo|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300210-48-4|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300210484/world-atlas-tattoo|format=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lion-man|Löwenmensch figurine]] from the [[Aurignacian]] culture dates to approximately 40,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.loewenmensch.de/lion_man.html | title = Der Löwenmensch | publisher = The Ulm Museum (Ulmer Museum)| access-date = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a series of parallel lines on its left shoulder.

The oldest and most famous direct proof of ancient European tattooing appears on the body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]], who was found in the [[Ötztal|Ötz valley]] in the Alps and dates from the late 4th millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt; Studies have revealed that Ötzi had 61 carbon-ink tattoos consisting of 19 groups of lines simple dots and lines on his lower spine, left wrist, behind his right knee and on his ankles. It has been argued that these tattoos were a form of healing because of their placement, though other explanations are plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scan finds new tattoos on 5300-year-old Iceman|journal=RedOrbit.com| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113319184/scan-finds-new-tattoos-on-5300-year-old-iceman-012215/|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The [[Picts]] may have been tattooed (or [[Scarification|scarified]]) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue [[woad]] (or possibly [[copper]] for the blue tone) designs. [[Julius Caesar]] described these tattoos in Book V of his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic Wars]]'' (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Gillian|title=Woad, Tattooing and Identity in Later Iron Age and Early Roman Britain|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2005|volume=24|issue=3|pages=273–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2005.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] wrote of his encounter with the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Rus' people|Rus']] tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from "fingernails to neck" with dark blue "tree patterns" and other "figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/viktatoo.shtml|title= Viking Answers|accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of [[Christianization of Europe|Christianization in Europe]], tattoos were often considered remaining elements of [[paganism]] and generally legally prohibited.

The significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, [[Baron Haussmann]], while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice "reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Michel | last = Carmona | pages = 235–6 | title = Haussmann: His Life and Times and the Making of Modern Paris | date = 2002 | publisher = Ivan R.

===Great Britain===
British and other pilgrims to the [[Holy Lands]] throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] in 1612. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1691, [[William Dampier]] brought to London a native of the [[Western New Guinea|western part]] of [[New Guinea]] (now part of [[Indonesia]]) who had a tattooed body and became known as the "Painted Prince".

Between 1766 and 1779, Captain [[James Cook]] made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to [[Polynesia]], they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word "tattoo" itself comes from the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''tatau'', and was introduced into the [[English language]] by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Thomas Chambers|title=Nottingham: its castle: a military fortress, a royal palace, a ducal mansion, a blackened ruin, a museum and gallery of art|date=1876|publisher=Hamilton, Adams|location=London|page=Appendix|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=njp.32101075991255;orient=0;size=100;seq=253;attachment=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Tahiti aboard the ''[[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the ship's log book recorded this entry: "Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible." Cook went on to write, "This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes."

Cook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed [[Raiatea]]n man, [[Omai]], whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day.&lt;ref&gt;A description of three of the men who took part in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] in 1789 refers to their being tattooed on the left breast, arms and 'backside' with designs such as stars, hearts, 'darts' and, in the case of a [[Isle of Man|Manxman]], the [[triskelion]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/additional_image_types.asp?extra_image_type_id=2&amp;image_id=39 nationalarchives.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe, and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.

By the 19th century, tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors&lt;ref&gt;"The reason why sailors tattoo themselves has often been asked." The Times (London), 30 January 1873, p. 10: The article describes recovery of bodies after a shipwreck:those of the crew were identifiable by their tattoos.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lower or even criminal class.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 3 April 1879, p. 9: "Crime has a ragged regiment in its pay so far as the outward ... qualities are concerned ... they tattoo themselves indelibly ... asserting the man's identity with the aid of needles and gunpowder. This may be the explanation of the Mermaids, the Cupid's arrows, the name of MARY, the tragic inscription to the memory of parents, the unintended pathos of the appeal to liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Tichborne case]], a witness, Lord Bellew, testified he and the missing Roger Tichborne tattooed each other while they were both schoolboys at [[Stonyhurst College]]. Tichborne left school in 1848. ''The Times'' (London), 2 February 1872, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A schoolboy at [[Rugby College|Rugby]] is described as self-tattooed - 'His long skinny arms all covered with anchors and arrows and letters, tattooed in with gunpowder like a sailor-boy's' - and is mildly rebuked for this by his headmaster.{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Thomas|title=Tom Brown's Schooldays|volume=2|chapter=3|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadwell|first=Albert H.|title=Sporting pictures on the human skin|journal=Country Life|date=27 January 1900}} Article describing work of society tattooist Sutherland Macdonald&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/macdonald_sutherland.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103145504/http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/macdonald_sutherland.html |archive-date=3 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its upmarket form, it could be a lengthy, expensive&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 18 April 1889, p. 12: "A Japanese Professional Tattooer". Article describes the activities of an unnamed Japanese tattooist based in Hong Kong. He charged £4 for a dragon, which would take 5 hours to do. The article ends "The Hong-Kong operator tattooed the arm of an English Prince, and, in Kioto, was engaged for a whole month reproducing on the trunk and limbs of an English peer a series of scenes from Japanese history. For this he was paid about £100. He has also tattooed ladies.... His income from tattooing in Hong Kong is about £1,200 per annum."&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes painful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadwell|first=Albert H.|title=Sporting pictures on the human skin|journal=Country Life|date=27 January 1900}} "In especially sensitive cases a mild solution of cocaine is injected under the skin, ... and no sensation whatever is felt, while the soothing solution is so mild that it has no effect ... except locally."&lt;/ref&gt; process.

Tattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] followed [[Edward VII|Edward VII's]] lead in getting tattooed; King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] of [[Denmark]], the King of [[Romania]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander of Yugoslavia]] and even [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] of [[Russia]], all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. [[King Alfonso XIII]] of modern [[Spain]] also had a tattoo.

The perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawley|first1=Lawrence|title=People always say the same thing about tattoos|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25330947|work=BBC News Magazine|publisher=BBC|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the [[House of Lords]] debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become "trendy" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, [[Baron Teynham|Lord Teynham]] and the [[Dudley Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]] however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 29 April 1969, p. 4: "Saving young from embarrassing tattoos".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, tattoos have become more socially acceptable and fashionable among celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24296713|title=Why do people go back for more and more tattoos?|first=Jon|last=Kelly|date=1 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24906132|title=Dimbleby gets first tattoo aged 75|date=12 November 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northeastern North America in the 17th century===
The [[Jesuit Relations]] of 1652 describes tattooing among the [[Petun]] and the [[Neutrals]]:
{{quote|
But those who paint themselves permanently do so with extreme pain, using,
for this purpose, needles, sharp awls, or piercing thorns, with which they
perforate, or have others perforate, the skin. Thus they form on the face, the
neck, the breast, or some other part of the body, some animal or monster, for
instance, an Eagle, a Serpent, a Dragon, or any other figure which they prefer;
and then, tracing over the fresh and bloody design some powdered charcoal, or
other black coloring matter, which becomes mixed with the blood and penetrates
within these perforations, they imprint indelibly upon the living skin the
designed figures. And this in some nations is so common that in the one which
we called the Tobacco, and in that which -- on account of enjoying peace with
the Hurons and with the Iroquois -- was called Neutral, I know not whether a
single individual was found, who was not painted in this manner, on some part
of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_38.html|title=home|date=11 August 2014|website=puffin.creighton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===North America===
[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M. Stevens Wagner]], one of the earliest [[Tattooed Ladies]] that performed in the circus sideshows, 1907]]

In the period shortly after the [[American Revolution]], to avoid [[impressment]] by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued [[protection papers]] to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] simply paid no attention to them. "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html "Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812."] By Ruth Priest Dixon. Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. "Frequently the "protection papers" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. The Slave's Gamble. MacMillan. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, [[tattoo]]s were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the [[protection papers]] issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]]. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-12/no-01/reviews/mcneur.shtml|title=Common-place › The journal of early American lifeCommon-place: The Journal of early American Life|work=common-place.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, "Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them."&lt;ref&gt;Dye, Ira. "The Tattoos of Early American Seafarers, 1796-1818." Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. 133.4 (1989): 520-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Inuit People =====
The [[Inuit people|Inuit People]] have a deep history of tattooing.  In the [[Inuktitut|Inuktituk]] language, the word kakiniit translates to the English word for tattoo&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oosten|first=Jarich|last2=Laugrand|first2=Frédéric|date=January 2016|title=The Bringer of Light: The Raven in Inuit Tradition|url=|journal=Polar Record|volume=42|issue=222|pages=187-204|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|196}} and the word tunniit means face tattoo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Among the Inuit, some nations tattooed female faces and parts of the body to symbolize a girl transitioning into a woman, coinciding with the start of her first menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|197}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A tattoo represented a woman's beauty, strength, and maturity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|197}}  This was an important practice because some Inuit believed that a woman could not transition into the spirit world without tattoos on her skin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Inuit People have [[Oral tradition|oral traditions]] that describe how the raven and the loon tattooed each other giving cultural significance to both the act of tattooing and the role of those animals in Inuit history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|10}}  European missionaries colonized the Inuit People in the beginning of the 20th century and associated tattooing as an evil practice&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|196}} "demonizing" anyone who valued tattoos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]] has helped Inuit women to revitalize the practice of traditional face tattoos through the creation of the documentary ''Tunniit: Retracing the Lines of Inuit Tattoos'', where she interviews elders from different communities asking them to recall their own elders and the history of tattoos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The elders were able to recall the traditional practice of tattooing which often included using a needle and thread and sewing the tattoo into the skin by dipping the thread in soot or seal oil, or through skin poking using a sharp needle point and dipping it into soot or seal oil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Hovak Johnston has worked with the elders in her community to bring the tradition of kakiniit back by learning the traditional ways of tattooing and using her skills to tattoo others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reawakening Our Ancestors' Lines: Revitalizing Inuit Traditional Tattooing|last=Johnston|first=Angela Hovak|publisher=Inhabit Media|year=2017|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Osage Nation =====
The [[Osage people|Osage People]] used tattooing for a variety of different reasons.  The tattoo designs were based on the belief that people were part of the larger cycle of life and integrated elements of the land, sky, water, and the space in between to symbolize these beliefs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drawing with Great Needles: Ancient Tattoo Traditions of North America|last=Dye|first=David H.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Deter-Wolf|editor-first=Aaron|location=Austin|pages=215-251|chapter=Snaring Life from the Star and the Sun|editor-last2=Diaz-Granados|editor-first2=Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|222-228}}  In addition, the Osage People believed in the smaller cycle of life, recognizing the importance of women giving life through childbirth and men removing life through warfare.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|216}}  Osage men were often tattooed after accomplishing major feats in battle, as a visual and physical reminder of their elevated status in their community.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Some Osage women were tattooed in public as a form of a prayer, demonstrating strength and dedication to their nation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}

===== Haudenosaunee People =====
The [[Haudenosaunee|Haudenosaunee People]] historically used tattooing in connection to war.

==Modern Western tattooing==

==="Reintroduction" to the Western world===
The popularity of modern Western tattooing owes its origins in large part to Captain [[James Cook|James Cook's]] voyages to the South Pacific in the 1770s, but since the 1950s a false belief has persisted that modern Western tattooing originated exclusively from these voyages.&lt;ref name=Friedman2012&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|last=Friedman Herlihy|first=Anna Felicity|title=Tattooed transculturites: Western expatriates among Amerindian and Pacific Islander societies, 1500–1900|date=June 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedman|first1=Anna Felicity|title=The Cook Myth: Common tattoo history debunked|date=5 April 2014|url=https://tattoohistorian.com/2014/04/05/the-cook-myth-common-tattoo-history-debunked/|website=tattoohistorian.com|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooing has been consistently present in Western society from the modern period stretching back to Ancient Greece,&lt;ref name=Friedman2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Caplan|editor-first=Jane|editor-link=Jane Caplan|title=Written on the body: The tattoo in European and American history|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-05723-1|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6922.html|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Was tattooing reintroduced to Europe or not?|date=April 2017}} though largely for different reasons.

Tattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the "Cook Myth".&lt;ref name=Friedman2012 /&gt;{{rp|18–20}} First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., "tattoo", "tatuaje", "tatouage", "Tätowierung", and "tatuagem") derive from the Tahitian word "tatau", which was introduced to European languages through Cook's travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including "pricked," "marked", "engraved," "decorated," "punctured," "stained," and "embroidered." Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook's voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.

===Pre-1960s===
The first documented professional [[tattoo artist|tattooer]] in the [[United States]] was [[Martin Hildebrandt]], a [[Germany|German]] immigrant who arrived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1846.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the [[American Civil War]]. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was [[Sutherland Macdonald]] in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1891, [[New York City|New York]] tattooer [[Samuel O'Reilly]] patented the first electric [[tattoo machine]], a modification of [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] [[electric pen]].

[[File:Nora Hildebrandt, by Charles Eisenmann.jpg|thumb|left|Nora Hildebrandt]]
The earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the [[circus]] in the late 19th century. These "[[Tattooed Ladies]]" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like [[Betty Broadbent]] and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osterud|first1=Amelia Klem|title=The tattooed lady: A history|date=2009|publisher=Speck Press|location=Golden, CO|isbn=978-1933108261|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tattoo Renaissance===
Although tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted.&lt;ref&gt;Nyssen, Carmen. "Early Tinkerers of Electric Tattooing" [http://www.buzzworthytattoo.com/tattoo-history-3/early-tinkerers-of-electric-tattooing/ www.buzzworthytattoo.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028190924/http://www.buzzworthytattoo.com/tattoo-history-3/early-tinkerers-of-electric-tattooing/ |date=28 October 2016 }}. Evidence indicates that electric tattoo machines were in use by the late 1880s, at least several years prior to the first tattoo machine patent obtained by Samuel F. O'Reilly on 8 December 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"&gt;Schildkrout, Enid. "Inscribing The Body." Annual Review of Anthropology 33.1 (2004): 319-44. JSTOR. Web. 28 January  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tattoo Renaissance began in the late 1950s, and was greatly influenced by several artists in particular [[Lyle Tuttle]], [[Cliff Raven]], Don Nolan, Zeke Owens, Spider Webb and [[Don Ed Hardy]]. A second generation of artists, trained by the first, continued these traditions into the 1970s, and included artists such as Bob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and [[Jack Rudy]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne M. Velliquette, Jeff B. Murray, and Elizabeth H. Creyer (1998) ,"The Tattoo Renaissance: an Ethnographic Account of Symbolic Consumer Behavior", in NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 25, eds. Joseph W. Alba &amp; J. Wesley Hutchinson, Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 461-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer [[Janis Joplin]] with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the [[San Francisco]] tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Deb Tattooing has also become a fad among celebrities. [[David Beckham]], an international soccer star, caught tattoo ‘fever’ beginning with the birth of his first son back in 1999 when he had Malloy ink his son’s name, "Brooklyn" at the bottom of his back. Acord. (19 November 2006). "Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo". ''Maine Sunday Telegram''.&lt;/ref&gt; For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has "undergone dramatic redefinition" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, DJ. |title=Secret Ink: Tattoo's Place in Contemporary American Culture|journal= Journal of American Culture|volume= 35|number=2 |year=2012|pages= 153–65|type= Print|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.2012.00804.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the "Marks of Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubin|editor1-first=Arnold|title=Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the term "Tattoo Renaissance" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic and social change.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Wearers of tattoos, as members of the [[counterculture]] began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Bodies of inscription: A cultural history of the modern tattoo community|date=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-2467-6|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Bodies-of-Inscription/index-viewby=title.html|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as [[Flash (tattoo)|flash]] to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as [[Sleeve tattoo|sleeves]], which are categorized under the relatively new and popular [[avant-garde]] genre.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Tattooers transformed into "Tattoo Artists": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.

Tattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.&lt;ref name=Mifflin1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Mifflin|first=Margot|authorlink=Margot Mifflin|title=Bodies of subversion: A secret history of women and tattoo|date=1997|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-89045-100-4|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Star Stowe]] (Miss February 1977) was the first [[Playboy Playmate]] with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.

During the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within [[Popular culture|pop culture]], inspiring television shows such as [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Inked]]'' and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[Miami Ink]]'' and ''[[LA Ink]]''. In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.

Contemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying [[Flash (tattoo)|tattoo flash]], examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of [[body art]] into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, ''Freaks &amp; Flash'', featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago art exhibition, [http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm ''Freaks &amp; Flash''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131447/http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm |date=27 February 2012 }}, for example, juxtaposed circus sideshow banners depicting tattooed performers like "The Tattooed Lady" alongside art inspired by the tattoo Renaissance of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir_Franz_by_Vladimir_Franz_prezidentem.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimír Franz]] was registered candidate in the [[Czech presidential election, 2013|2013 Czech presidential election]].]]

Over the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from "low" to "high" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in "exotic" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.

As various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. [[Feminist theory]] has much to say on the subject. "Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo", by [[Margot Mifflin]], became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a [[Harris poll]], 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men.&lt;ref&gt;Braverman, Samantha. "One in Five U.S. Adults Now Has a Tattoo." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. N.p, 23 February  2012. Web. 7 February  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Miss Kansas, [[Theresa Vail]], became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the "[[Serenity Prayer]]" along the right side of her torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/09/10/the-tattooed-miss-kansas-and-other-miss-america-firsts/ | work=The Washington Post | title=The Reliable Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, William Mullane of [[London]] was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father's [[Cremation|ashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent_messenger/news/son-uses-dads-ashes-in-4774/ |title=Grieving son William Mullane asks Maidstone tattoo artist Brendan Mudd to create artwork from dad's ashes |author=Angela Cole |publisher=kentonline.co.uk |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point.&lt;ref&gt;http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2013/1/Cummings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by the [[Ninth Circuit]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach]], 621 F. 3d 1051 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Militaries from around the world ==
Throughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.

The United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be "prejudicial to good order and discipline", or "of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as "obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant "excessive scarring" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AF evolves policies to access more talent, maintain high standards|url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/1045846/af-evolves-policies-to-access-more-talent-maintain-high-standards.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Navy has changed its policies{{when|date=April 2018}} and become more lenient when it comes to tattoos. For the first time the navy is allowing sailors to have neck tattoos as long as one inch. Sailors will also be allowed to have as many tattoos of any size on the arms, and legs as long as they are not deemed to be offensive tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=93927|title=New Tattoo Policy|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

The Indian Army tattoo policy has been in place since 11 May 2015.

The '''Hubble–Reynolds law''' models the [[surface brightness]] of [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] as

:&lt;math&gt;I(R) = \frac{I_0}{(1+R/R_H)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;I(R)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface brightness]] at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the central brightness, and &lt;math&gt;R_H&lt;/math&gt; is the radius at which the surface brightness is diminished by a factor of 1/4. It is asymptotically similar to the [[De Vaucouleurs' law]] which is a special case of the [[Sersic profile]] for elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Binney &amp; Tremaine. ''Galactic Dynamics'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is named for the astronomers [[Edwin Hubble]] and [[John Reynolds (astronomer)|John Henry Reynolds]].

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviorism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customization]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "magic bullet" or "hypodermic needle theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Commmunication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1197). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology''. University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-sites.net/english/mitchell.htm w.j.t. mitchell and the image (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immunoproteomics''' is the study of large sets of [[protein]]s ([[proteomics]]) involved in the [[Immune system|immune response]].

Examples of common applications of immunoproteomics include:
* The isolation and mass spectrometric identification of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC (major histocompatibility complex)]] binding peptides
* Purification and identification of protein [[antigen]]s binding specific [[Antibody|antibodies]] (or other affinity reagents)
* Comparative immunoproteomics to identify proteins and pathways modulated by a specific infectious organism, disease or toxin.

The identification of proteins in immunoproteomics is carried out by techniques including gel based, microarray based, and DNA based techniques, with mass spectroscopy typically being the ultimate identification method.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fulton|first=Kelly M.|last2=Twine|first2=Susan M.|date=2013-01-01|title=Immunoproteomics: current technology and applications|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=1061|pages=21–57|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-589-7_2|issn=1940-6029|pmid=23963929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Immunology ===
Immunoproteomics is and has been used to increase scientific understanding of both [[autoimmune disease]] pathology and progression. Using biochemical techniques, [[gene]] and ultimately protein expression can be measured with high fidelity. With this information, the biochemical pathways causing pathology in conditions such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Crohn's disease]] can potentially be elucidated. Serum antibody identification in particular has proven to be very useful as a diagnostic tool for a number of diseases in modern medicine, in large part due to the relatively high stability of serum antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tjalsma|first=Harold|last2=Schaeps|first2=Renée M. J.|last3=Swinkels|first3=Dorine W.|date=2008-02-01|title=Immunoproteomics: From biomarker discovery to diagnostic applications|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prca.200780012/abstract|journal=Proteomics: Clinical Applications|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=167–180|doi=10.1002/prca.200780012|issn=1862-8354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immunoproteomic techniques are additionally used for the isolation of antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Blazer|first2=Levi|last3=Romer|first3=Terence|last4=Faber|first4=Lee|last5=Buller|first5=R. Mark|last6=Boyle|first6=Michael D. P.|date=2005-02-05|title=Immunoproteomics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023204006245|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|series=Proteomic Databases Part III|volume=815|issue=1–2|pages=65–75|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.07.047}}&lt;/ref&gt; By identifying and proceeding to sequence antibodies, scientists are able to identify potential protein targets of said antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesan|first=Vinitha|last2=Schmidt|first2=Brigitte|last3=Avula|first3=Raghunandan|last4=Cooke|first4=Dagney|last5=Maggiacomo|first5=Taylor|last6=Tellin|first6=Lawton|last7=Ascherman|first7=Dana P.|last8=Bruchez|first8=Marcel P.|last9=Minden|first9=Jonathan|date=2015-06-01|title=Immuno-proteomics: Development of a novel reagent for separating antibodies from their target proteins|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570963914002714|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics|series=Medical Proteomics|volume=1854|issue=6|pages=592–600|doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2014.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it is possible to determine the antigen(s) responsible for a particular immune response. Identification and engineering of antibodies involved in autoimmune disease pathology may offer novel techniques in disease therapy.

===Drug engineering===
By identifying the antigens responsible for a particular immune response, it is possible to identify viable targets for novel drugs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falisse-Poirrier|first1=Nandini|last2=Ruelle|first2=Virginie|last3=ElMoualij|first3=Benaissa|last4=Zorzi|first4=Danièle|last5=Pierard|first5=Olivier|last6=Heinen|first6=Ernst|last7=De Pauw|first7=Edwin|last8=Zorzi|first8=Willy|title=Advances in immunoproteomics for serological characterization of microbial antigens|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|date=1 December 2006|volume=67|issue=3|pages=593–596|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2006.05.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701206001540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, specific  antigens can further be classified based on immunoreactivity for identification of future potential [[vaccine]] preparations.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In addition to the identification of vaccine candidates, immunoproteomic techniques such as western blotting can additionally be used for measuring the efficacy of a given vaccine.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

== Technology and instrumentation ==

=== Mass spectrometry ===
[[Mass spectrometry]] can be used in the sequencing of MHC binding motifs, which can subsequently be used to predict [[T cell]] [[epitope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=A. W.|last2=Gorman|first2=J.

=== 2-D gel electrophoresis and western blotting ===
[[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] (2-D gel) techniques in culmination with [[western blot]]ting has been used for many years in the identification of immune response magnitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be accomplished by comparing various samples against [[molecular-weight size marker]]s for qualitative analysis and  against known amounts of protein standards for quantitative analysis.[[File:2D-Gel Electrophoresis Apparatus.jpg|thumb|Common 2D-gel electrophoresis apparatus]]

=== 2-D liquid chromatography ===
By coupling [[Chromatography|liquid chromatography]] with a variety of other immunodetection techniques such as serological [[proteome]] analysis (SERPA), it is possible to analyze the [[hydrophobicity]], [[Isoelectric point|PI]], [[Mass|relative mass]], and antibody reactivity of antibodies within a given serum.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

=== Microarray ===
[[DNA microarray|Microarray]] analysis of various serums can be used as a means to identify changes in gene expression before, after, and during a given immune response.

'''Institute of Philosophy''' of the [[University of Warsaw]] (Polish ''Instytut filozofii Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego'') is a research institution located in Warsaw, part of the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology of the University of Warsaw. It is renowned mainly for its contribution to the development of modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] ([[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]] - [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]]) and to [[history of ideas]] ([[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] - [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Maria Ossowska]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Adam Schaff]]). Provides master's degree studies, doctor's degree studies and postgraduate studies in philosophy both in Polish and in English.

== The 18th and 19th century ==

The main centre of the medieval and early modern [[History of philosophy in Poland|Polish philosophy]] was [[Kraków]] - history of philosophy in Warsaw begins in the 18th century. In the pre-partition Varsovian institutions, the [[Collegium Nobilium (Warsaw)|Collegium Nobilium]] and the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Szkoła Rycerska]] to the lecturers of philosophy belonged [[Antoni Wiśniewski]] and [[Marcin Nikuta]]. In the 19th century, after the foundation of the University of Warsaw in 1815, due to [[russification]] of the schools Polish philosophy, both idealist and positivist, developed mainly outside universities. Among main Polish philosophers connected with the 19th century University of Warsaw were [[Adam Zabellewicz]] and  [[Henryk Struve]].

== Interwar period ==

After 1918, when Poland regained independence, University of Warsaw was reorganized. Chairs of philosophy were held by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] and [[Stanisław Schayer]].

Initially, philosophical education were organized in the Faculty of Historical-Philosophical Studies (1915–16), soon transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1916–27), and then into the Faculty of the Humanities (Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and Schayer) and the Faculty of Mathematical Studies and Physics (Łukasiewicz, Leśniewski and Ajdukiewicz).

Other important philosophers teaching in Warsaw were [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Henryk Elzenberg]], [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]]. Worldwide renown in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] was enjoyed by the Warsaw School of Logic, part of the philosophical movement of [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]].

During the German occupation of Warsaw secret courses of philosophy were conducted by Łukasiewcz, Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and others.

== History after 1945 ==

After 1945, during the stalinist era, due to political predominance of marxist philosophy in Poland some professors were partially prohibited from pursuing didactic activity. After the [[Polish October]] (1956) a separate Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1954–65) emerged from the Faculty of Arts and many leading philosophers were allowed to teach. It was subsequently transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical-Sociological Studies (1965–68).

In the 50. and 60. [[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] emerged. To this informal group of non-analytical philosophers belonged mainly former marxists (called "revisionist"), inspired to some extent by the ideas of Tatarkiewicz and Ossowskis. After the [[1968 Polish political crisis|Polish March]] (1968), when many "revisionist" Polish philosophers and sociologists (for example [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], [[Adam Schaff]]) participated in the events, philosophy at Warsaw University was subjected to a thorough reorganization. Chairs were renamed to departments and the Faculty of Philosophical Studies were forcibly joined with the Faculty of Sociology, within which the Institute of Philosophy was established.

In the post-war period the tradition of Lvov-Warsaw School was also continued. To the most important philosophers and logicians of the post-war period connected with the University of Warsaw belong [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Zdzisław Augustynek]], [[Bronisław Baczko]], [[Marek Fritzhand]], [[Henryk Jankowski]], [[Andrzej Kasia]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Władysław Krajewski]], [[Tadeusz Kroński]], [[Jan Legowicz]], [[Stefan Morawski]], [[Elżbieta Pietruska-Madej]], [[Marian Przełęcki]], [[Adam Schaff]], [[Marek Siemek]], [[Adam Sikora]], [[Roman Suszko]], [[Klemens Szaniawski]] and [[Bogusław Wolniewicz]].

== Close-approach data ==
As of August 2013 (planetary [[ephemeris]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|DE431]]) close-approach data is available for the major planets and the 16 most massive asteroids. Close approach data is available by adding ";cad=1" to the end of the body's [[URL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2017U1;cad=1|title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser - 'Oumuamua (A/2017 U1)|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbit diagram ==
A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applet is available and provided as a 3D orbit visualization tool. The applet was implemented using unreliable [[Two-body problem|2-body methods]], and hence should not be used for determining accurate long-term trajectories (over several years or decades) or planetary encounter circumstances. For accurate ephemerides use the [[JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System]] that handles the [[n-body problem]] using [[numerical integration]]. The Java applet is available by adding ";orb=1" to the end of the body's URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2017U1;orb=1|title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser - 'Oumuamua (A/2017 U1)|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Jane Bennett) data sheet (b. 7/31/57)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] political theorist and philosopher. She is professor at the Department of Political Science, [[Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences#Departments|Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences]].

== Education ==
Jane Bennett originally trained in environmental studies and political science. She then went on to [[Cornell University]] to study environmental science. After Cornell she studied political theory and gained her degree (''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'') in 1979 from [[Siena College]], [[Loudonville, New York]]. Whilst at Siena College Bennett met [[Kathy Ferguson]]. Bennett then went on to the [[University of Massachusetts]] and qualified as a doctor of [[political science]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review /&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web | title= Jane Bennett | url= http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/bios/jane-bennett/vita%202013%20November.doc | publisher= Department of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= 25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Bennett's work considers [[ontology|ontological]] ideas about the [[Speculative realism#Transcendental Materialism / Neo-Vitalism|relationship between humans and 'things']], what she calls "vital materialism",
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"What counts as the material of vital materialism? Is it only human labour and the socio-economic entities made by men using raw materials? Or is materiality more potent than that? How can political theory do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in every event and every stabilization? Is there a form of theory that can acknowledge a certain ‘thing-power’, that is, the irreducibility of objects to the human meanings or agendas they also embody?"''&lt;ref name="Vital_materialism"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khan | first = Gulshan | title = Agency, nature and emergent properties: an interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–105 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | doi = 10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public lectures she has given include "Impersonal Sympathy", a talk theorizing 'sympathy' in which she considered the alchemist-physician [[Paracelsus|Paracelsus (1493-1541)]] and [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman's]] collection of poetry, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.&lt;ref name=CISSC&gt;{{cite web|title=CISSC Lecture Series: Jane Bennett, Johns Hopkins University: Impersonal Sympathy |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728234301/http://cissc.concordia.ca/lecturesconferencesandevents/2012-13/?share=1|publisher=Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture, Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Bennett delivered the annual Neal A.

A '''kiss''' is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of [[love]], [[Passion (emotion)|passion]], [[romance (love)|romance]], [[sexual attraction]], [[sexual activity]], [[sexual arousal]], [[affection]], [[respect]], [[greeting]], [[friendship]], [[peace]], and good luck, among many others. In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or [[sacrament]]. The word came from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:en:cyssan#Old English|cyssan]]'' ("to kiss"), in turn from ''coss'' ("a kiss").

[[Anthropologist]]s are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing, one believing that it is [[instinct]]ual and intuitive and the other that it evolved from what is known as ''[[premastication|kiss feeding]]'', a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies' mouths.&lt;ref name=demirjian&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7348582 The (Mostly) Blissful History of Kissing], ''NPR'' February 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to kissing-like behavior comes from the [[Vedas]], Sanskrit scriptures that informed [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150714-why-do-we-kiss?ocid=fbind|title=Why do humans kiss each other when most animals don't?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], around 3,500 years ago, according to Vaughn Bryant, an anthropologist at Texas A&amp;M University who specializes in the history of the kiss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine’s-day-story-starters/] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141204235151/http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine%E2%80%99s-day-story-starters/ |date=2014-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both lip and tongue kissing are mentioned in [[Sumer]]ian poetry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kramer |first=Samuel Noah |year=1981 |title=History Begins at Sumer |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-1276-1 |pages=72ff |edition=3rd revised.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissing is described in the surviving [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptian]] love poetry from the [[New Kingdom]], found on [[Papyrus|papyri]] excavated at [[Deir el-Medina]]:
{{quote|Finally I will drink life from your lips &lt;br /&gt;and wake up from this ever lasting sleep.}}

{{quote|And when her lips are pressed to mine &lt;br /&gt;I am made drunk and need not wine.&lt;br /&gt;When we kiss, and her warm lips half open,&lt;br /&gt;I fly cloud-high without beer!}}

The earliest reference to kissing in the [[Old Testament]] is in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 27:26, when [[Jacob]] deceives his father to obtain his blessing:
{{quote|And his father [[Isaac]] said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.}}

Genesis 29:11 features the first man-woman kiss in the [[Bible]], when Jacob flees from [[Esau]] and goes to the house of his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]:
{{quote|And Jacob kissed [[Rachel]], and lifted up his voice, and wept.}}

Much later, there is the oft-quoted verse from the [[Song of Songs]]:
{{quote|May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,&lt;br /&gt;for your love is better than wine.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Richard S. ''Song of Songs'', Baker Academic (2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/songs/1-2.htm "Song of Solomon 1:2], Bible Hub, Biblos&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' (370 BC), [[Xenophon]] wrote about the [[Persis|Persian]] custom of kissing in the lips upon departure while narrating the departure of [[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 600 BC) as a boy from his [[Medes|Median]] kinsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Xen.%20Cyr.%201.4.28 1.4.27]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), when two Persians meet, the greeting formula expresses their equal or inequal status. They do not speak; rather, equals kiss each other on the mouth, and in the case where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii|title=HERODOTUS  iii. DEFINING THE PERSIANS  – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herodotus-persians.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=legacy.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later Classical period, affectionate mouth-to-mouth kissing was first described in the Hindu epic the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

Academics who have studied it say kissing spread slowly to other parts of the world after [[Alexander the Great]] and his army conquered parts of Punjab in northern India in 326 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208001512/http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romans]] helped to spread the habit to most of Europe and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="Lorenzi"&gt;Lorenzi, Rossella [http://news.discovery.com/history/history-of-kissing-130214.htm Kissing's Long History: Discovery News] Feb 14, 2013 08:30 AM ET, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans were passionate about kissing and talked about several types of kissing. Kissing the hand or cheek was called an {{lang|la|osculum}}. Kissing on the lips with mouth closed was called a {{lang|la|basium}}, which was used between relatives. A kiss of passion was called a {{lang|la|suavium}}.&lt;ref name="Terry Jones"&gt;Jones, Terry "The Ancient World According to Terry Jones (Love and Sex)" (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissing was not always an indication of ''eros'', or love, but also could show respect and rank as it was used in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].

The study of kissing started sometime in the nineteenth century and is called '''philematology''', which has been studied by people including Cesare Lombroso, [[Ernest Crawley]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and modern scholars such as [[Elaine Hatfield]].&lt;ref name=Kirshenbaum&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/14/opinion/kirshenbaum-science-kissing "The science of kissing"], ''CNN'', Feb. 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Furtwangler&gt;[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 "Chemical attraction: The science of kissing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090009/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 |date=2013-08-23 }}, ''Medill Reports'', Feb. 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristoffer Nyrop identified a number of types of kisses, including kisses of love, affection, peace, respect and friendship. He notes, however, that the categories are somewhat contrived and overlapping, and some cultures have more kinds, including the French with twenty and the Germans with thirty.&lt;ref name=Nyrop&gt;Nyrop, Christoper. ''The Kiss and its History'', Sands &amp; Co., London (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UQgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Read full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expression of affection ===

Kissing another person's lips has become a common expression of affection or warm greeting in many cultures worldwide. Yet in certain cultures, kissing was introduced only through European settlement, before which it was not a routine occurrence. Such cultures include certain indigenous peoples of Australia, the Tahitians, and many tribes in Africa.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;Dyer, Tristeleton T.F. "The History of Kissing", ''The American Magazine'', vol. 14 1882, pp. 611–614&lt;/ref&gt;

A kiss can also be used to express feelings without an erotic element but can be nonetheless "far deeper and more lasting", writes Nyrop. He adds that such kisses can be expressive of love "in the widest and most comprehensive meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|79}}

Nyrop writes that the most common example is the "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between other members of the same family, which can include those outside the immediate family circle, "everywhere where deep affection unites people."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|82}} The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when [[Orpah]] kissed her mother-in-law and when [[Moses]] went to meet his father-in-law, he "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him. The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], as when [[Odysseus]], on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|82–83}}

Affection can be a cause of kissing "in all ages in grave and solemn moments," notes Nyrop, "not only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of profound gratitude. When the [[Apostle Paul]] took leave of the elders of the congregation at [[Ephesus]], "they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him" (Acts 20:37). Kisses can also be exchanged between total strangers, as when there is a profound sympathy with or the warmest interest in another person.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|85}}

[[Folk poetry]] has been the source of affectionate kisses where they sometimes played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the "redeeming power of the kiss are to be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her." In the reverse situation, in the tale of "[[Beauty and the Beast]]", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|95–96}}

A kiss of affection can also take place after death. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], it is written that when Jacob was dead, "Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him." And it is told of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Muhammad]]'s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when the prophet was dead, he went into the latter's tent, uncovered his face, and kissed him. Nyrop writes that "the kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved, and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether world."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|97}}

Kissing on the lips can be a physical expression of affection or love between two people in which the sensations of touch, taste, and smell are involved.&lt;ref name=Brayer /&gt; According to the psychologist Menachem Brayer, although many "mammals, birds, and insects exchange caresses" which appear to be kisses of affection, they are not kisses in the human sense.

Surveys indicate that kissing is the second most common form of [[physical intimacy]] among United States adolescents (after [[holding hands]]), and that about 85% of 15 to 16-year-old adolescents in the US have experienced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00061-0 |pmid=10706169 |title=Smart teens don't have sex (or kiss much either) |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2000 |last1=Halpern |first1=Carolyn Tucker |last2=Joyner |first2=Kara |last3=Udry |first3=J.Richard |last4=Suchindran |first4=Chirayath }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kiss on the lips ===
The kiss on the lips can be performed between two [[friend]]s or family. This move aims to express affection for a friend. Unlike kissing for [[love]], a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The kiss on the lips is a practice that can be found in the time of [[Patriarchs (Bible)]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greece]], the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Gasc, racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[kiss of peace]] was recommended by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Yannick Carré, ''Le baiser sur la bouche au Moyen Âge : rites, symboles, mentalités, à travers les textes et les images, XIe-XVe siècles'', Le Léopard d'Or, 1992, page 357&lt;/ref&gt; The kiss on the lips was also common among knights.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Gasc racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson, Adi Adams, Ian Rivers, Archives of Sexual Behavior [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47521172_I_Kiss_Them_Because_I_Love_Them_The_Emergence_of_Heterosexual_Men_Kissing_in_British_Institutes_of_Education “I Kiss Them Because I Love Them”: The Emergence of Heterosexual Men Kissing in British Institutes of Education], UK, April 2012, Volume 41. 2, pages 421–430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal 7sur7.be, [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/1176526/2010/10/29/Nouvelle-tendance-des-bisous-sur-la-bouche-entre-amis.dhtml Nouvelle tendance: des bisous sur la bouche entre amis!], Belgium, October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail Reporter, dailymail.co.uk, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1324799/How-men-kissing-lips-friendship-longer-taboo.html How men kissing each other on the lips in friendship is 'no longer taboo'], UK, October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romantic kiss ===
[[File:Kuss.jpg|thumb|A romantic kiss]]

In many cultures, it is considered a harmless custom for [[teenagers]] to kiss on a [[dating|date]] or to engage in [[party games|kissing games]] with friends. These games serve as icebreakers at parties and may be some participants' first exposure to sexuality. There are many such games, including [[Truth or Dare?]], [[Seven Minutes in Heaven]] (or the variation "Two Minutes in the Closet"), [[Spin the Bottle]], [[Post Office (game)|Post Office]], and Wink.

The psychologist William Cane notes that kissing in [[Western world|Western]] society is often a romantic act and describes a few of its attributes:
{{quotation|It's not hard to tell when two people are in love. Maybe they're trying to hide it from the world, still they cannot conceal their inner excitement. Men will give themselves away by a certain excited trembling in the muscles of the lower jaw upon seeing their beloved. Women will often turn pale immediately of seeing their lover and then get slightly red in the face as their sweetheart draws near. This is the effect of physical closeness upon two people who are in love.&lt;ref name=Cane&gt;Cane, William. ''The Art of Kissing'', Macmillan (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9}}}}

Romantic kissing in Western cultures is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature. In the Middle Ages it became a social gesture and was considered a sign of refinement of the upper classes.&lt;ref name=Brayer&gt;Brayer, Menachem M. ''The Jewish Woman in Rabbinic Literature'', KTAV Publishing House (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|150–151}} Other cultures have different definitions and uses of kissing, notes Brayer. In [[China]], for example, a similar expression of affection consists of rubbing one's nose against the cheek of another person. In other Eastern cultures kissing is not common. In South East Asian countries the "sniff kiss" is the most common form of affection and Western [[Human mouth|mouth]] to mouth kissing is often reserved for sexual foreplay. In some tribal cultures the "equivalent for our 'kiss me' is 'smell me.'"{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The kiss can be an important expression of love and [[eroticism|erotic]] emotions. In his book ''The Kiss and its History'', Kristoffer Nyrop describes the kiss of love as an "exultant message of the longing of love, love eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the lovers' lips, and 'rises,' as Charles Fuster has said, 'up to the blue sky from the green plains,' like a tender, trembling thank-offering." Nyrop adds that the love kiss, "rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all other earthly joys in sublimity."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|30}} He also compares it to achievements in life: "Thus even the highest work of art, yet, the loftiest reputation, is nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|31}}

The power of a kiss is not minimized when he writes that "we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss ..." Kissing, he implies, can lead one to maturity: "It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers," and can keep one feeling young: "It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth." The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: "In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss," and "man craves for it as his noblest reward."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|37}}

As a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new. Nyrop gives a vivid example in the classic love story of [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. As a reward "Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis—an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock":&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|47}}
{{quotation|Ye gods, what are my feelings. Her lips are softer than the rose's leaf, her mouth is sweet as honey, and her kiss inflicts on me more pain than a bee's sting. I have often kissed my kids, I have often kissed my lambs, but never have I known aught like this. My pulse is beating fast, my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet, nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?}}
Romantic kissing "requires more than simple proximity," notes Cane. It also needs "some degree of intimacy or privacy, ... which is why you'll see lovers stepping to the side of a busy street or sidewalk."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt; Psychologist [[Wilhelm Reich]] "lashed out at society" for not giving young lovers enough privacy and making it difficult to be alone.&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt; However, Cane describes how many lovers manage to attain romantic privacy despite being in a public setting, as they "lock their minds together" and thereby create an invisible sense of "psychological privacy." He adds, "In this way they can kiss in public even in a crowded plaza and keep it romantic."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt;{{Rp|10}} Nonetheless, when Cane asked people to describe the most romantic places they ever kissed, "their answers almost always referred to this ends-of-the-earth isolation, ... they mentioned an apple orchard, a beach, out in a field looking at the stars, or at a pond in a secluded area ..."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt;{{Rp|10}}

== Kiss as ritual ==
[[File:Maestranza-1.jpg|thumb|Kiss on the crucifix in Christianity]]
[[File:Denis Thatcher Nancy Reagan 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Thatcher]], husband of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Hand-kissing|kissing the hand]] of [[Nancy Reagan]] wife of US President in 1988]]

Throughout history, a kiss has been a ritual, formal, symbolic or social gesture indicating devotion, respect or greeting. It appears as a ritual or symbol of religious devotion. For example, in the case of kissing a temple floor, or a religious book or icon. Besides devotion, a kiss has also indicated subordination or, nowadays, respect.

In modern times the practice continues, as in the case of a bride and groom kissing at the conclusion of a wedding ceremony or national leaders kissing each other in greeting, and in many other situations.

=== Religion ===
A kiss in a religious context is common. In earlier periods of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] kissing became a ritual gesture, and is still treated as such in certain customs, as when "kissing... relics, or a bishop's ring."&lt;ref name=Brayer /&gt; In [[Judaism]], the kissing of prayer books such as the [[Torah]], along with kissing [[Tallit|prayer shawls]], is also common.&lt;ref&gt;Kuraweil, Arthur.''The Torah for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing (2008) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Crawley notes that it was "very significant of the affectionate element in religion" to give so important a part to the kiss as part of its ritual. In the early Church the baptized were kissed by the celebrant after the ceremony, and its use was even extended as a salute to saints and religious heroes, with Crawley adding, "Thus Joseph kissed Jacob, and his disciples kissed Paul. Joseph kissed his dead father, and the custom was retained in our civilization", as the farewell kiss on dead relatives, although certain sects prohibit this today.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;Crawley, Ernest. ''Studies of Savages and Sex'', Kessinger Publishing (revised and reprinted) (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|126}}

A distinctive element in the Christian [[liturgy]] was noted by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] in the 2nd century, now referred to as the "[[kiss of peace]]," and once part of the rite in the primitive Mass. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] has stated that this act originated within the ancient Hebrew [[synagogue]], and [[Philo]], the ancient Jewish philosopher called it a "kiss of harmony", where, as Crawley explains, "the Word of God brings hostile things together in concord and the kiss of love."&lt;ref name=Crawley /&gt;{{Rp|128}} [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Saint Cyril]] also writes, "this kiss is the sign that our souls are united, and that we banish all remembrance of injury."&lt;ref name=Crawley /&gt;{{Rp|128}}

=== Kiss of peace ===
Nyrop notes that the [[kiss of peace]] was used as an expression of deep, spiritual devotion in the [[early Christian Church]]. Christ said, for instance, "Peace be with you, my peace I give you," and the members of Christ's Church gave each other peace symbolically through a kiss. [[St Paul]] repeatedly speaks of the "holy kiss," and, in his [[Epistle]] to the Romans, writes: "Salute one another with an holy kiss" and his first Epistle to the Thessalonians ([[1 Thessalonians]] 5:26), he says: "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|101}}

The kiss of peace was also used in [[secular]] festivities. During the [[Middle Ages]], for example, Nyrop points out that it was the custom to "seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a kiss." Even knights gave each other the kiss of peace before proceeding to the combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs. The holy kiss was also found in the ritual of the Church on solemn occasions, such as baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or obsequies. However, toward the end of the Middle Ages the kiss of peace disappears as the official token of reconciliation.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|109}}

=== Kiss of respect ===
[[File:Re-enactment at the Seashore (5851205620) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man kissing the ground after a long sea voyage (as part of a reenactment of the first landing of English settlers in Virginia in 1607)]]
The kiss of respect is of ancient origin, notes Nyrop. He writes that "from the remotest times we find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful—to the gods, their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors; out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon were greeted with kisses."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|114}}

He notes some examples, as "when the prophet [[Hosea]] laments over the idolatry of the children of [[Israel]], he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them." In classical times similar homage was often paid to the gods, and people were known to kiss the hands, knees, feet, and the mouths, of their idols. [[Cicero]] writes that the lips and beard of the famous statue of [[Hercules]] at [[Agrigentum]] were worn away by the kisses of devotees.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|115}}

People kissed the cross with the image of Jesus, and such kissing of the cross is always considered a holy act. In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that "as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed." Kissing the cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and the pictures and statues of saints—not only their pictures, "but even their relics are kissed," notes Nyrop. "They make both soul and body whole." There are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their health by kissing relics, he points out.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|121}}

The kiss of respect has also represented a mark of fealty, humility and reverence. Its use in ancient times was widespread, and Nyrop gives examples: "people threw themselves down on the ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally 'licked the dust,' as it is termed."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|124}} "Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe the kiss of respect. The Roman slaves kissed the hands of their masters; pupils and soldiers those of their teachers and captains respectively."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|124}} People also kissed the earth for joy on returning to their native land after a lengthened absence, as when [[Agamemnon]] returned from the [[Trojan War]].

=== Kiss of friendship ===
The kiss is also commonly used in American and European culture as a salutation between friends or acquaintances. The friendly kiss until recent times usually occurred only between ladies, but today it is also common between men and women, especially if there is a great difference in age. According to Nyrop, up until the 20th century, "it seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of royal personages," although he notes that in former times the "friendly kiss was very common with us between man and man as well as between persons of opposite sexes." In guilds, for example, it was customary for the members to greet each other "with hearty [[handshake]]s and smacking kisses," and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed both their hosts and hostesses.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|142}}

== Cultural significance ==
Approximately ten percent of the world do not kiss for a variety of reasons, including that they find it dirty or for superstitious reasons. For example, in parts of [[Sudan]] it is believed that the mouth is the portal to the soul, so they do not want to invite death or have their spirit taken.&lt;ref name=demirjian /&gt; Psychology professor [[Elaine Hatfield]] noted that "kissing was far from universal and even seen as improper by many societies."&lt;ref name=India&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-india-kisses-are-on-rise-even-in-public.html?_r=0 "In India, Kisses Are on Rise, Even in Public"], ''New York Times'', Feb. 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Despite kissing being widespread, in some parts of the world it still is taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.

Donald Richie comments that in Japan, as in China, although kissing took place in erotic situations, in public "the kiss was invisible", and the "touching of the lips never became the culturally encoded action it has for so long been in Europe and America." The early [[Edison films|Edison film]], ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Widow Jones&amp;nbsp;– the May Irwin-John Rice Kiss]]'' (1896), created a sensation when it was shown in Tokyo, and people crowded to view the enormity.

In modern [[Western culture]], kissing on the lips is commonly an expression of [[affection]]&lt;ref name=zambianchronicle-kiss&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Larry |url=http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/ |title=The Romantic Kiss |work=The Zambian Chronicle |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621143336/http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/&lt;!--Bot retrieved archive--&gt; |archivedate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a warm greeting. When lips are pressed together for an extended period, usually accompanied with an [[hug|embrace]], it is an expression of romantic and sexual desire. The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their [[tongue]] into their mouth, is called [[French kiss]]ing. "[[Making out]]" is often an [[adolescent]]'s first experience of their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and games which involve kissing, such as [[Spin the Bottle]], facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.

In modern [[Eastern culture]], the etiquette vary depending on the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a baby on the cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.

=== Kissing in films ===
The first romantic kiss on screen was in American silent films in 1896, beginning with the film ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]''. The kiss lasted 30 seconds and caused many to rail against decadence in the new medium of silent film. Writer [[Louis Black]] writes that "it was the United States that brought kissing out of the Dark Ages."&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;''Texas Monthly'', Feb. 1980 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; However, it met with severe disapproval by defenders of public morality, especially in New York. One critic proclaimed that "it is absolutely disgusting. Such things call for police interference."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt;

Young moviegoers began emulating romantic stars on the screen, such as [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]], the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, traveling up her arm, and then kissing her on the back of her neck. Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like [[Nazimova]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Vilma Bánky]] and [[Greta Garbo]], became screen idols as a result.

Eventually the film industry began to adopt the dictates of the [[Production Code]] established in 1934, overseen by [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] and supported by the church{{Which|date=June 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the new code, "Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt; As a result, kissing scenes were shortened, with scenes cut away, leaving the imagination of the viewer to take over. Under the code, actors kissing had to keep their feet on the ground and had to be either standing or sitting.&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Lana. ''A Compendium of Kisses'', Harlequin Publ. (2010) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of romantic kissing on the screen took place in the early sound era, during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWKOctKUVGQ Kissing scenes in the classic movies]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|watch}} Body language began to be used to supplement romantic scenes, especially with the eyes, a talent that added to Greta Garbo's fame. Author Lana Citron writes that "men were perceived as the kissers and women the receivers. Should the roles ever be reversed, women were regarded as vamps . . ."&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; According to Citron, [[Mae West]] and [[Anna May Wong]] were the only Hollywood actresses never to have been kissed on screen.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; Among the films rated for having the most romantic kisses are ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt;

Sociologist Eva Illouz notes that surveys taken in 1935 showed that "love was the most important theme represented in movies. Similar surveys during the 1930s found the 95% of films had romance as one of their plot lines, what film critics called "the romantic formula."&lt;ref name=Illouz&gt;Illouz, Eva. ''Consuming the Romantic Utopia'', Univ. of Calif. Press (1997) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Japanese films, kissing and sexual expression were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), but when the film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?" Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were "sneaky", claiming that "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too."&lt;ref&gt;Kyoko Hirano, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: The Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945–1952'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1992), pp 154–57, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Where cheek kissing is used, in some countries a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an [[air kiss]] is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not.&lt;ref name=UIO-kiss&gt;{{cite web |last=Hahnsson |first=Marie Sophie |url=http://folk.uio.no/mariesha/webmag/cheekKissing.html |title=Cheek Kissing |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a first [[dating|date]], it is common for the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.

A symbolic kiss is frequent in Western cultures. A kiss can be "blown" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term ''flying kiss'' is used in India to describe a blown kiss. In written correspondence a kiss has been represented by the letter "X" since at least 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oxford English Dictionary – X |publisher=Oxford University press |year=1999 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288416 |accessdate=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stage or screen kiss may be performed by actually kissing, or faked by using the thumbs as a barrier for the lips and turning so the audience is unable to fully see the act.

In traditional Islamic cultures kissing is not permitted between a man and woman who are not married or closely related by blood or marriage. A [[Cheek kissing|kiss on the cheek]] is a very common form of greeting among members of the same sex in most Islamic countries, much like the south European pattern.

Kissing was a custom during the Biblical period mentioned in the {{bibleverse||Genesis|27:26|HE}}, when [[Isaac]] kissed his son [[Jacob]].&lt;ref name=Tabor&gt;Tabor, Rev. T.H. ''Manford's Magazine'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|585}} The kiss is used in numerous other contexts in the Bible: the kiss of homage, in [[Esther]] 5:2; of subjection, in 1 [[Samuel]] 10:1; of reconciliation, in 2 Samuel 14:33; of valediction, in [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 1:14; of approbation, in [[Psalms]] 2:12; of humble gratitude, in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:38; of welcome, in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:7; of love and joy, in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:11. There are also spiritual kisses, as in [[Canticles]] 1:2; sensual kisses, as in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 7:13; and hypocritical kisses, as in 2 [[Samuel]] 15:5. It was customary to kiss the mouth in biblical times, and also the beard, which is still practiced in Arab culture. Kissing the hand is not biblical, according to Tabor.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt; The kiss of peace was an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] custom, and continues to be one of the rites in the [[Eucharist]]ic services of [[Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt;

In the Roman Catholic Order of Mass, the bishop or priest celebrant bows and kisses the altar, reverencing it, upon arriving at the altar during the entrance procession before Mass and upon leaving at the recessional at the closing of Mass; if a deacon is assisting, he bows low before the altar but does not kiss it.

Among primitive cultures it was usual to throw kisses to the sun and to the moon, as well as to the images of the gods. Kissing the hand is first heard of among the Persians.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt; According to Tabor, the kiss of homage—the character of which is not indicated in the Bible—was probably upon the forehead, and was expressive of high respect.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt;

=== Physiology ===
Kissing is a complex behavior that requires significant muscular [[coordination (physiology)|coordination]] involving a total of 34&amp;nbsp;facial muscles and 112&amp;nbsp;postural muscles.&lt;ref name=independent-kiss&gt;{{cite news|last=Blue |first=Adrienne |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960601/ai_n14047247 |title=The kiss |work=The Independent (London) |date=1 June 1996 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223014805/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960601/ai_n14047247 |archivedate=23 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-kiss&gt;{{cite news|last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2006/10/17/dlkiss17.xml |title=Seal with..146 muscles |work=The Telegraph |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026052832/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fconnected%2F2006%2F10%2F17%2Fdlkiss17.xml |archivedate=26 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[muscle]] involved is the [[orbicularis oris muscle]], which is used to pucker the [[lip]]s and informally known as the ''kissing muscle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=orbicularis oris muscle |publisher=TheFreeDictionary: Mosby's Dental Dictionary, 2nd edition |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/orbicularis+oris+muscle |year=2008 |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Muscles – Facial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/factfiles/facial/frontalis.shtml |publisher=BBC: Science &amp; Nature: Human Body &amp; Mind |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the French kiss, the tongue is also an important component.

=== Health benefits ===
Affection in general has [[stress (biological)|stress]]-reducing effects. Kissing in particular has been studied in a [[controlled experiment]] and it was found that increasing the frequency of kissing in marital and cohabiting relationships results in a reduction of perceived stress, an increase in relationship satisfaction, and a lowering of [[cholesterol]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Floyd |first=Kory |last2=Boren |first2=Justin P. |last3=Hannawa |first3=Annegret F. |last4=Hesse |first4=Colin |author5=Breanna McEwan |author6=Alice E.

=== Disease transmission ===
Kissing on the lips can result in the transmission of some diseases, including [[infectious mononucleosis]] (known as the "kissing disease") and [[herpes simplex]] when the infectious viruses are present in saliva. Research indicates that contraction of [[HIV]] via kissing is extremely unlikely, although there was a documented case in 1997 of an HIV infection by kissing. Both the woman and infected man had [[Gingivitis|gum disease]], so transmission was through the man's blood, not through saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Altman |first=Lawrence K. |title=Case of H.I.V.

In [[computer science]], '''language-based security''' ('''LBS''') is a set of techniques that may be used to strengthen the security of applications on a high level by using the properties of programming languages.
LBS is considered to enforce computer security on an application-level, making it possible to prevent vulnerabilities which traditional operating system security is unable to handle.

[[Application software|Software applications]] are typically specified and implemented in certain [[programming language]]s, and in order to protect against attacks, flaws and bugs an application’s [[source code]] might be vulnerable to, there is a need for application-level security; security evaluating the applications behavior with respect to the programming language. This area is generally known as language-based security.

== Motivation ==
The use of large software systems, such as [[SCADA]], is taking place all around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can we learn from SCADA security incidents?|url=http://www.oas.org/cyber/documents/ENISA%20-%20Can%20we%20learn%20from%20SCADA%20security%20incidents%20-%20White%20Paper.pdf|website=www.oas.org|publisher=enisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computer systems constitute the core of many infrastructures. The society relies greatly on infrastructure such as water, energy, communication and transportation, which again all rely on fully functionally working computer systems. There are several well known examples of when critical systems fail due to bugs or errors in software, such as ''when shortage of computer memory caused LAX computers to crash and hundreds of flights to be delayed'' (April 30, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air Traffic Control System Failed|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476246/malware-vulnerabilities/-2-billion-air-traffic-control-system-failed-by-running-out-of-computer-memo.html|accessdate=12 May 2014|publisher=www.computerworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Software Bug Contributed to Blackout|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8016|accessdate=11 February 2004|publisher=www.securityfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the mechanisms used to control the correct behavior of software are implemented at the operating system level. The operating system handles several possible security violations such as memory access violations, stack overflow violations, access control violations, and many others. This is a crucial part of security in computer systems, however by securing the behavior of software on a more specific level, even stronger security can be achieved. Since a lot of properties and behavior of the software is lost in compilation, it is significantly more difficult to detect vulnerabilities in machine code. By evaluating the source code, before the compilation, the theory and implementation of the programming language can also be considered, and more vulnerabilities can be uncovered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So why do developers keep making the same mistakes? Instead of relying on programmers' memories, we should strive to produce tools that codify what is known about common security vulnerabilities and integrate it directly into the development process."

— D. Evans and D. Larochelle, 2002
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objective of Language-based security ==
By using LBS, the security of software can be increased in several areas, depending on the techniques used. Common programming errors such as allowing [[buffer overflow]]s and illegal information flows to occur, can be detected and disallowed in the software used by the consumer. It is also desirable to provide some proof to the consumer about the security properties of the software, making the consumer able to trust the software without having to receive the source code and self checking it for errors.

A compiler, taking source code as input, performs several language specific operations on the code in order to translate it into machine readable code. [[Lexical analysis]], [[Preprocessor|preprocessing]], [[parsing]], [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]], [[Code generation (compiler)|code generation]], and [[code optimization]] are all commonly used operations in compilers. By analyzing the source code and using the theory and implementation of the language, the compiler will attempt to correctly translate the high-level code into low-level code, preserving the behavior of the program.

[[File:Model of certifying compiler.png|thumb|Illustrating a certifying compiler]]

During compilation of programs written in a [[Type safety|type-safe]] language, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the source code must type-check successfully before compilation. If the type-check fails, the compilation will not be performed, and the source code needs to be modified. This means that, given a correct compiler, any code compiled from a successfully type-checked source program should be clear of invalid assignment errors. This is information which can be of value to the code consumer, as it provides some degree of guarantee that the program will not crash due to some specific error.

A goal of LBS is to ensure the presence of certain properties in the source code corresponding to the safety policy of the software. Information gathered during the compilation can be used to create a certificate that can be provided to the consumer as a proof of safety in the given program. Such a proof must imply that the consumer can trust the compiler used by the supplier and that the certificate, the information about the source code, can be verified.

The figure illustrates how certification and verification of low-level code could be established by the use of a certifying compile. The software supplier gains the advantage of not having to reveal the source code, and the consumer is left with the task of verifying the certificate, which is an easy task compared to evaluation and compilation of the source code itself. Verifying the certificate only requires a limited trusted code base containing the compiler and the verifier.

== Techniques ==
=== Program analysis ===
{{Main|Program analysis}}
The main applications of [[program analysis]] are [[program optimization]] (running time, space requirements, power consumption etc.) and [[program correctness]] (bugs, security vulnerabilities etc.). Program analysis can be applied to compilation ([[static analysis]]), run-time ([[dynamic analysis]]), or both. In language-based security, program analysis can provide several useful features, such as: [[type checking]] (static and dynamic), [[reference monitor|monitoring]], [[taint checking]] and [[control-flow analysis]].

=== Information flow analysis ===
{{Main|Information flow (information theory)|l1=Information flow}}
Information flow analysis can be described as a set of tools used to analyze the [[Information flow (information theory)#Information flow control|information flow control]] in a program, in order to preserve [[confidentiality]] and [[Data integrity|integrity]] where regular [[access control]] mechanisms come short.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By decoupling the right to access information from the right to disseminate it, the flow model goes beyond the access matrix model in its ability to specify secure information flow. A practical system needs both access and flow control to satisfy all security requirements."

— D. Denning, 1976
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Access control enforces checks on ''access'' to information, but is not concerned about what happens after that. An example: A system has two users, Alice and Bob. Alice has a file ''secret.txt'', which is only allowed to be read and edited by her, and she prefers to keep this information to herself. In the system, there also exists a file ''public.txt'', which is free to read and edit for all users in the system. Now suppose that Alice has accidentally downloaded a malicious program. This program can access the system as Alice, bypassing the access control check on ''secret.txt''. The malicious program then copies the content of ''secret.txt'' and places it in ''public.txt'', allowing Bob and all other users to read it. This constitutes a violation of the intended confidentiality policy of the system.

==== Noninterference ====
[[Non-interference (security)|Noninterference]] is a property of programs that does not leak or reveal information of variables with a ''higher'' security classification, depending on the input of variables with a ''lower'' security classification. A program which satisfies noninterference should produce the same ''output'' whenever the corresponding same ''input'' on the ''lower'' variables are used. This must hold for every possible value on the input. This implies that even if ''higher'' variables in the program has different values from one execution to another, this should not be visible on the ''lower'' variables.

An attacker could try to execute a program which does not satisfy noninterference repeatedly and systematically to try to map its behavior. Several iterations could lead to the disclosure of ''higher'' variables, and let the attacker learn sensitive information about for example the systems state.

Whether a program satisfies noninterference or not can be evaluated during compilation assuming the presence of [[security type system]]s.

=== Security type system ===
{{Main|Security type system}}
A [[security type system]] is a kind of [[type system]] that can be used by software developers in order to check the security properties of their code. In a language with security types, the types of variables and expressions relate to the security policy of the application, and programmers may be able to specify the application security policy via type declarations. Types can be used to reason about various kinds of security policies, including authorization policies (as access control or capabilities) and information flow security. Security type systems can be formally related to the underlying security policy, and a security type system is sound if all programs that type-check satisfy the policy in a semantic sense. For example, a security type system for information flow might enforce noninterference, meaning that type checking reveals whether there is any violation of confidentiality or integrity in the program.

=== Securing low-level code ===
Vulnerabilities in low-level code are bugs or flaws that will lead the program into a state where further behavior of the program is undefined by the source programming language. The behavior of the low-level program will depend on compiler, runtime system or operating system details. This allows for an attacker to drive the program towards an undefined state, and exploit the behavior of the system.

Common exploits of insecure low-level code lets an attacker perform unauthorized reads or writes to memory addresses. The memory addresses can be either random  or chosen by the attacker.

==== Using safe languages ====
An approach to achieve secure low-level code is to use safe high-level languages. A safe language is considered to be completely defined by its programmers' manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Benjamin C.|title=Types and Programming Languages|date=2002|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any bug that could lead to implementation-dependent behavior in a safe language will either be detected at compile time or lead to a well-defined error behavior at run-runtime. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], if accessing an array out of bounds, an exception will be thrown. Examples of other safe languages are [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Scala programming language|Scala]].

==== Defensive execution of unsafe languages ====
During compilation of an unsafe language run-time checks is added to the low-level code to detect source-level undefined behavior. An example is the use of [[Buffer overflow protection#Canaries|canaries]], which can terminate a program when discovering bounds violations.
A downside of using run-time checks such as in bounds-checking is that they impose considerable performance overhead.

[[Memory protection]], such as using non-executable stack and/or heap, can also be seen as additional run-time checks. This is used by many modern operating systems.

==== Isolated execution of modules ====
The general idea is to identify sensitive code from application data by analyzing the source code. Once this is done the different data is separated and placed in different modules.  When assuming that each module has total control over the sensitive information it contains, it is possible to specify when and how should leave the module. 
An example is a cryptographic module that can prevent keys from ever leaving the module unencrypted.

=== Certifying compilation ===
Certifying compilation is the idea of producing a certificate during compilation of source code, using the information from the high-level programming language semantics. This certificate should be enclosed with the compiled code in order to provide a form of proof to the consumer that the source code was compiled according to a certain set of rules. The certificate can be produced in different ways, e.g. through [[Proof-carrying code]] (PCC) or [[Typed assembly language]] (TAL).

==== Proof-carrying code  ====
The main aspects of PCC can be summarized in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozen|first1=Dexter|title=Language Based Security|date=1999|publisher=Cornell University|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/lbs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The supplier provides an executable program with various annotations produced by a [[certifying compiler]].
# The consumer provides a verification condition, based on a [[security policy]]. This is sent to the supplier.
# The supplier runs the verification condition in a [[Automated theorem proving|theorem prover]] to produce a proof to the consumer that the program in fact satisfies the security policy.
# The consumer then runs the proof in a [[Automated proof checking|proof checker]] to verify the proof validity.

An example of a certifying compiler is the [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/touchstone.html Touchstone compiler], that provides a PCC formal proof of type- and memory safety for programs implemented in Java.

==== Typed assembly language ====
TAL is applicable to programming languages that make use of a [[type system]]. After compilation, the [[object code]] will carry a type annotation that can be checked by an ordinary type checker. The annotation produced here is in many ways similar to the annotations provided by PCC, with some limitations. However, TAL can handle any security policy that may be expressed by the restrictions of the type system, which can include memory safety and control flow, among others.

The '''Latin American Social Sciences Institute''' or '''Latin American School of Social Sciences''' ('''{{lang-es|Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales}}''' or '''FLACSO''') is an inter-governmental autonomous organization for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] dedicated to research, teaching and spreading of [[social science]]s.

It was created on April 17, 1957,&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; following a [[UNESCO]] initiative at the Latin American Conference on Social Sciences in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Its goal was to promote academic research and development in the region.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite news|first=Manuel|last=Avendaño |title=Josette Altmann, ex primera dama, electa Secretaria General de Flacso |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Josette-Altmann-secretaria-Flacso_0_1564643619.html |work=[[La Nación (San José)]] |date=2016-07-14 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its membership is open to Latin American and Caribbean countries that subscribe to the FLACSO agreement. Current members include: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Suriname]] and Uruguay.

[[Josette Altmann Borbón]], a historian and former [[First Lady of Costa Rica]], was elected Secretary General of FLACSO in June 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; She succeeded Manuel González on July 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt;

They were originally mapped by Iberall by drawing a series of circles over a portion of the body and then watching their deformations as the wearer walked around or performed various tasks. The circles deform into ellipses as the skin stretches over the moving musculature, and these deformations were recorded. After a huge number of such measurements the data is then examined to find all of the possible deformations of the circles, and more importantly, the non-moving points on them where the original circle and the deformed ellipse intersect (at four points per circle). By mapping these points over the entire body, a series of lines are produced.

These lines may then be used to direct the placement of tension elements in a [[spacesuit]] to enable constant suit pressure regardless of the motion of the body.&lt;ref name=Newman2005/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">The '''marine reservoir effect''' is a phenomenon affecting [[radiocarbon dating]].  Because much of the carbon consumed by organisms in the ocean is older than that consumed by organisms on land, samples from marine life and from organisms that consumed a lot of sea-based foods while alive may appear older than they truly are when tested.&lt;ref name=Eureka&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiocarbon dating reveals mass grave did date to the Viking age|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-02/uob-rdr020118.php|author=University of Bristol|publisher=Eurekalert|date=February 2, 2018|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to account for changes in the Earth's oceans to correct for the marine reservoir effect.&lt;ref name=Ascough2005&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methodological approaches to determining the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0309133305pp461ra|author1=Philippa Ascough|author2=Gordon Cook| author3=Andrew Dugmore|volume=29|issue=4|pages=532-547|journal=Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment|doi=10.1191/0309133305pp461ra|date=December 1, 2005|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, affected radiocarbon dates appear c. 400 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C years older than they would if unaffected. But the effect is highly variable in space and time, and can reach 800 to 1200 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C years in Arctic regions.&lt;ref name=Ascough2005/&gt;

==Notable cases==

Since its initial discovery in the 1980s, a [[Viking]] burial site in England confounded archeologists.  It contained coins and other physical materials associated with the late 800s c.e., the time of the [[Great Danish Army]], but the radiocarbon dating placed the roughly 300 bodies within at a variety of different dates spanning centuries.  In February 2018, a team out of the [[University of Bristol]] published a study attributing this to the large amounts of sea-based foods eaten by Vikings and placed the burial site in the late 800s.&lt;ref name = Eureka&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UBristol&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/30DFE4A0D5581DEBC8B43096A37985EE/S0003598X1700196Xa.pdf/viking_great_army_in_england_new_dates_from_the_repton_charnel.pdf|title=The Viking Great Army in England: new dates from the Repton charnel|author1=Catrine L.

A '''mass deficit''' is the amount of mass (in stars) that has been removed from the center of a [[galaxy]], presumably by the action of a [[binary star|binary]] [[supermassive black hole]].

[[File:mdef.jpg|thumb|left|The figure illustrates how mass deficits are measured, using the observed brightness profile of a galaxy]]

The density of stars increases toward the center in most galaxies. In small galaxies, this increase continues into the very center. In large galaxies, there is usually a "core", a region near the center where the density is constant or slowly rising. The size of the core – the "core radius" – can be a few hundred [[parsec]]s in large [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferrarese |first=Laura |display-authors=etal |editor-first=Vladimir|editor-last=Karas |editor2-first=Giorgio |editor2-last=Matt |title=Black Holes: from Stars to Galaxies|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2007 |pages= 261–268|chapter=The Inner Workings of Early-Type Galaxies: Cores, Nuclei and Supermassive Black Holes |isbn=978-0-521-86347-6 |chapter-url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173713/?site_locale=en_GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dullo, Bililign T.; Graham, Alister W.

It is believed that cores are produced by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Binary SMBHs form during the [[galaxy merger|merger of two galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Begelman |first= M. C. |title= Massive black hole binaries in active galactic nuclei |journal= Nature |volume= 287 |issue= 5780|pages= 307–309 |date= 1980 |doi= 10.1038/287307a0|bibcode= 1980Natur.287..307B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a star passes near the massive binary, it will be ejected, by a process called the [[gravitational slingshot]]. This ejection continues until most of the stars near the center of the galaxy have been removed. The result is a low-density core. Such cores are ubiquitous in giant elliptical galaxies.

The mass deficit is defined&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Milosavljevic |first= Milos |author-link= |last2= Merritt |first2= David |author2-link= David Merritt |last3= Rest |first3= Armin |last4= van den Bosch |first4= Frank |title= Galaxy cores as relics of black hole mergers |journal= [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 331 |issue= 4 |pages= L51–L55 |date= 2002 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05436.x|arxiv= astro-ph/0110185 |bibcode= 2002MNRAS.331L..51M}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the amount of mass that was removed in creating the core. Mathematically, the mass deficit is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{def}= 4\pi\int_0^{R_c} \left[\rho_i(r) - \rho(r) \right]r^2 dr&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the original density, ''ρ'' is the observed density, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the core radius.  In practice, the [[core-Sersic model]] can be used to help quantify the deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Graham |first= Alister |title= Core Depletion from Coalescing Supermassive Black Holes |journal= The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume= 613 |issue= 1 |pages= L33–L36 |date= 2004 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/613/1/L33/ |doi= 10.1086/424928 |bibcode=2004ApJ...613L..33G|arxiv= astro-ph/0503177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observed mass deficits are typically in the range of one to a few times the mass of the central SMBH,&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed core radii are comparable to the [[sphere of influence (black hole)|influence radii]] of the central SMBH. These properties are consistent with what is predicted in theoretical models of core formation &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Merritt |first= David |author-link= David Merritt |title= Mass Deficits, Stalling Radii, and the Merger Histories of Elliptical Galaxies |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 648 |issue= 2|pages= 976–986 |date= 2006 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/648/2/976/ |doi= 10.1086/506139 |bibcode=2006ApJ...648..976M|arxiv= astro-ph/0603439}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lend support to the hypothesis that all bright galaxies once contained binary SMBHs at their centers.

It is not known whether most galaxies still contain massive binaries, or whether the two black holes have coalesced. Both possibilities are consistent with the presence of mass deficits.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17443">'''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''' ('''MAPS''') is a multi-year, municipal capital improvement program, consisting of a number of projects, originally conceived in the 1990s in [[Oklahoma City]] by its then mayor [[Ron Norick]]. A MAPS program features several interrelated and defined capital projects, funded by a temporary sales tax (allowing projects to be paid for in cash, without incurring debt), administered by a separate dedicated city staff funded by the sales tax, and supervised by a volunteer citizens oversight committee.

In some ways, a MAPS program is similar to a [[Local option sales tax]].  However, taxes collected by a MAPS program do not go to a city's general fund, but are instead deposited into a trust dedicated to the specific projects identified in the taxes' enabling ordinance.  Additionally, MAPS programs are only indirectly controlled by a city's elected governance body; a citizens oversight committee provides direct oversight, which is also established by the enabling ordinance.

==Features of a MAPS program==
The key features of the original program were designed to provide accountability to the citizens of the community as well as provide a funding mechanism for capital projects without using a city's general revenue funds, and included:
* Several capital projects, each designed to appeal to a variety of demographic groups within the city, while at the same time having "those projects geographically close to each other to create a synergy of activity for people."&lt;ref name=Norick&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-4194-former-mayor-ron-norick-discusses-how-current-maps-proposal-differs-from-first.html|title=Former Mayor Ron Norick discusses how current MAPS proposal differs from first|author=Scott Cooper|date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The overall program would be funded by a dedicated, multi-year sales tax with a start date and end date
* Projects would be paid for in cash, without incurring debt; with this "pay as you go" approach, construction does not start until the cost of the project has been collected; money is in an interest bearing bank account and not deposited in the city's general fund.
* The Program would be overseen by a volunteer citizens advisory committee, whose recommendations for architects, plans and construction documents, contractors, and change-orders would be forwarded to city council for approval   
* Projects would be administered by a separate and dedicated city staff, hired specifically for the term of the program, with salaries and expenses a component of program costs, paid from sales tax revenue   
* Each project would be allocated an endowment sufficient to operate and maintain the building without additional cost to the city's general fund

A common challenge of "pay as you go" programs such as MAPS is that, because the lead-up time while accumulating the needed funds can be lengthy, specific projects of the program "are often are scuttled when administrations change and new leaders want their own signature projects... Oklahoma City was able to avoid this pitfall ‹because the city› changes mayors, but not strategies."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.placemakingchicago.com/places/oklahoma-city.asp | title=Placemaking Chicago: Oklahoma City | author=Evan Severs | date=April 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because the voters approved a multi-year temporary sales tax that was dedicated to multiple specific projects that together had significant public support, and because the infrastructure to support the program and its projects was also temporary with dedicated funding from the sales tax, a change in elected officials has not been sufficient to change the scope of the program.

A key to success is the feature of multiple projects; while each project taken individually might not have sufficient support for individual funding, when taken as a group, the package has sufficient support for funding.  Said another way, it is important to "bundle projects to enhance community buy-in."&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/123404971/MAPS-Oklahoma-City-Metropolitan-Area-Projects | title=Lessons Learned: Community &amp; Economic Development Case Studies | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago | author=Les Le | date=2003-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another benefit of multiple projects is that by staging the projects, citizens may have their confidence level increased by being shown staggered "early results ‹with less expensive projects› ... by experiencing a string of groundbreakings."&lt;ref name=lessons /&gt;

==History==
In many ways the [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States began in Oklahoma City with the collapse of the [[Penn Square Bank]].  This subsequent collapse of the state's energy business and failure of additional financial institutions, lead to a significant out-migration and excess capacity in real estate.  The resulting lack of infrastructure investment in the inner city proved to be a factor in the city's inability to attract new business.&lt;ref name=renewal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brownfieldrenewal.com/renewal-award-project-economic_impact-city_of_oklahoma_city___metropolitan_area_projects-1.html | title=The Renewal Rewards: Economic Impact - City of Oklahoma City - Metropolitan Area Projects | publisher=Redevelopment and Renewal Magazine |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s some Oklahoma City interests were concerned about what they perceived as civic decline. In 1992, after the city lost a contract to house a new maintenance facility for [[United Airlines]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] because the airline considered Indianapolis to have a better [[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]], then-mayor [[Ron Norick]] and the [[Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce]] proposed MAPS as a measure to improve the city's economy and attractiveness as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbBNr5ZzwUC&amp;pg=PT234&amp;dq=%22metropolitan+area+projects+plan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22metropolitan%20area%20projects%20plan%22&amp;f=false|title=Civic revolutionaries: igniting the passion for change in America's communities|author1=Douglas C.

City residents were initially skeptical over funding the public projects through a sales tax increase, and as late as a month before the tax [[referendum]] opposed the plan by a 20% margin.  However, the plan did pass by a slim margin in a vote in December, 1993.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;  During the five year tax period the city raised nearly $310 million in direct taxes, plus $52 million of income on the tax money it had deposited.  The tax was extended with voter approval for an additional six months to raise enough money to complete all of the projects, and construction continued until 2004.

Encouraged by the success of MAPS, city leaders proposed and adopted "MAPS for Kids", a public school improvement program.  In December 2009 the city approved a third program, "[[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]]", which would build $777 million in further improvements paid for by a similar sales tax increase.

==Oklahoma City MAPS initiative==
The MAPS initiatives in Oklahoma City, to date, consist of three major programs: The original MAPS program, MAPS for Kids, and MAPS 3.

===MAPS===
The original '''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''', or '''[http://www.okc.gov/maps MAPS]''', was a $350 million [[public works]] and [[redevelopment]] project in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] during the middle to late 1990s, funded by a temporary, five year, voter-approved [[sales tax]] increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.okcchamber.com/index.php?submenu=ChamberHistory&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ChamberHistory&amp;category=About|title=Chamber History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The various MAPS projects were believed to be capable of improving the economy and attractiveness of this ‹downtown› core and having a profound impact on proximal areas;"&lt;ref name=renewal /&gt; the common theme of the projects was downtown redevelopment.  The original MAPS program comprised nine projects that took 10 years to complete, and were chosen to appeal to a wide variety of city residents and also revitalize the city's downtown: 
*renovations to the [[Civic Center Music Hall]] including the 2,500 seat Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater, the 290 seat Freedie Little Theater, the 100 seat City Space Theater, the 5,000 sf Minders Hall of Mirrors, and the 3,100 sf Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall.  
*renovations to [[Cox Convention Center|The Myriad (now the Cox Convention Center)]] including a 100,000 sf expansion of the convention space. The Cox center also includes a 15,000 seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] hockey team (the top farm team of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]). 
*renovations to the [[Oklahoma State Fairgrounds]] 
*construction of the [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]] home of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games.

===MAPS for Kids===
The second MAPS program, called [http://www.okc.gov/ocmaps MAPS for Kids], was a $700 million initiative to improve schools in the various school districts whose boundaries coincided with the City of Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma has school districts whose boundaries have nothing to do with the boundaries of any other political subdivision.  At the time the original MAPS tax was expiring, the [[Oklahoma City Public Schools]] system was struggling with little political capital.  "They could not pass bond issues, and the school buildings were falling apart as a result."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | title=Oklahoma City Invests in New Urban Infrastructure | author=Mick Cornett | publisher=American Infrastructure,  Peninsula Publishing, Inc. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142117/http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | archivedate=2014-07-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] proposed a second MAPS program to repair more than 100 area schools.  With the addition of a $180-million bond issue and an eye on addressing childhood obesity issues, new gymnasiums were added to all of the Oklahoma City District's elementary schools. The program was approved by voters in 2001. This temporary sales tax was collected for seven years, with 70 percent disbursed to the Oklahoma City School District and 30 percent to 23 Suburban School Districts.

===MAPS 3===
{{main|Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3}}
[http://www.okc.gov/maps3 MAPS 3] is a $777 million program, approved by voters in 2009 with 54% of the vote (the same percentage as the Original MAPS.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/maps3 | title=MAPS 3 Oklahoma City | publisher=NewsOK.com | accessdate=27 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ends in December 2017.  After a year of public meetings organized by Mayor [[Mick Cornett]], there developed a consensus that a future MAPS program should focus on projects that improved the [[Quality of Life]] in Oklahoma City.  Hundreds of citizens suggested projects to be considered; through a series of public meetings eight projects were eventually selected to be included in the MAPS 3 proposal.
*New Downtown Convention Center
*New Downtown Public Park - 70 acres, including festival areas
*New Modern Streetcar/Transit system and an inter-modal transit hub
*New Senior Health and Wellness Centers; multiple structures in various parts of the city designed to encourage healthy lifestyles and serve as a gathering place for active seniors
*Improvements to the Oklahoma River including a whitewater training facility and various upgrades to the world-class rowing racecourse
*Improvements to the Oklahoma State Fair Grounds including replacing public event buildings
*Expansion of Trails system that interconnects the city's major parks for walking and biking 
*Expansion of neighborhood sidewalks to create a more walkable community
Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component.

The public forum process used to identify projects to be included in the MAPS 3 program established enough public political support to overcome an effort by a newly elected city council person who attempted to derail the original MAPS 3 proposal. An initiative petition was filed that would have eliminated the Convention Center and ended the Sales tax earlier.  This council person also ran for Mayor, with MAPS being a major factor in the election. Mayor Cornett was re-elected for an unprecedented 4th term with 65.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-citys-mick-cornett-wins-fourth-term-as-mayor/article/3940020 | title=Oklahoma City's Mick Cornett wins fourth term as mayor | publisher=Daily Oklahoman | date=4 Mar 2014 | author=William Crum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of MAPS in Oklahoma City===
The MAPS programs have had significant impact in Oklahoma City, both economically and from a quality of life standpoint. In the 20 years since its inception "nearly $5 billion in economic impact can be attributed to the original MAPS program. This represents a nearly 10-fold return on the city's original investment." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/economic%20forecast%202014.pdf | title=2014 Greater Oklahoma City Economic Forecast |author1=Russell Evans |author2=Eric Long | date=2014 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As was recently reported in a Wichita newspaper, 
"From quirky festivals and dozens of restaurants to outdoor recreation and romantic riverboat rides, a revitalized downtown Oklahoma City boasts so many attractions it is quickly becoming a favorite weekend destination for Oklahomans and Kansans alike." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/05/17/3461812/okc-offers-more-activities-than.html#storylink=cpy | author =Andi Atwatwer | title=OKC offers More Activities than you'd Think | date=2014-05-17 | publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is arguable that in terms of associated investment, hotels segment represent the largest impact of the original MAPS.   "In 1992-93 when the city's leaders developed the plans for the MAPS investments, there was only one significant hotel operating in downtown Oklahoma City. What is now the Sheraton had nearly 400 rooms but was in need of upgrading. By 2008, there were seven significant hotels in the Downtown CBD and Bricktown with a total of about 1,600 rooms."&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;{{rp|15}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">'''Narcotizing dysfunction''' is a theory that as [[mass media]] inundates people on a particular issue, they become apathetic to it, substituting knowledge for action.&lt;ref&gt;Baran ''et al.'' pp.179-80 quotation: {{quotation|one of the first media effects to be studied in some depth using functional analysis was the '''narcotizing dysfunction''', the idea that as news about an issue inundates people, they become apathetic to it... These findings were disturbing because they suggested that even when media are effective at surveying the environment and calling attention to societal problems (a manifest function), ... media coverage might "[[narcotics|narcotize]]" [the public] so that they become apathetic and decide that they are powerless to do anything (a latent dysfunction).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the vast supply of communications Americans receive may elicit only a superficial concern with the problems of society. This would result in real societal action being neglected, while superficiality covers up mass [[apathy]]. Thus, it is termed "[[wikt:dysfunctional|dysfunctional]]" as it indicates the inherent dysfunction of both [[mass media]] and [[social media]] during controversial incidents and events. The theory assumes that it is not in the best interests of people to form a social mass that is politically apathetic and inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir |url=https://asosindex.com/cache/articles/sosyal-medyanin-uyusturan-etkisi-f187234.pdf|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|date=April 2016|department=Rethinking the Contributions of Social Media to Democracy and Social Movements|journal=Cankiri Karatekin University Journal of Institute of Social Sciences|format=PDF|volume=7 |issue=1|page=1023|id=ASOS f187234|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=...social media can act against political participation &amp; grass roots mobilization because social media &amp; other internet based technologies "discourage face-to-face communication"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irfanerdogan.com/dergiweb2008/24/13.pdf| title=Mass communication, popular taste, and organized social action|vauthors=Lazarsfeld PF, Merton RK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''narcotizing dysfunction'' was identified in the article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action'', by [[Paul F.

Mass media's overwhelming flow of information has caused the populace to become passive in their social activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir|date=2016-04-01|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301685342_Narcotizing_Effect_of_Social_Media|journal=Çankırı Karatekin Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the individual is assailed with information about a huge range of issues and problems and they are knowledgeable about or able to discuss these issues, they believe they are helping to resolve these issues. As more time is spent educating oneself on current issues, there is a decrease in time available to take organized social action. Courses of action may be discussed, but they are rather internalized and rarely come to fruition. In short, people have unwittingly substituted knowledge for action.&lt;ref name="M+L-1957" /&gt; People's consciences are clear, as they think they have done something to address the issue. However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, [[political participation]] continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKKzMtuS2EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=gx1KP6lvC2&amp;dq=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;f=false|title=MediaWriting: Print, Broadcast, and Public Relations|first1=Rik|last1=Whitaker|first2=Janet|last2=Ramsey|first3=Ronald D.|last3=Smith|date=19 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203886700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term &lt;i&gt;narcotizing dysfunction&lt;/i&gt; gained popularity from its use in the 1948 article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action'', by Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton. In Lazarsfeld and Merton's article, it appears as the third function of mass media's problematic social effects, alongside social status conferral function and the enforcement of social norms.

'''Neuroepidemiology''' is a branch of [[epidemiology]] involving the study of [[neurological disease]] distribution and determinants of frequency in human populations. The term was first introduced by Dr. Len Kurland, Dr. Milton Alter and Dr. [[John F. Kurtzke]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Dr V Feigin, personal communication with Dr J Kutrzke&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, neuroepidemiology has been perceived for a long time as a science of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], [[prevalence]], [[risk factor]]s, [[natural history of disease|natural history]] and [[prognosis]] of neurological disorders. However, this is only one part of neuroepidemiology, called non-experimental neuroepidemiology. The other integral, but commonly forgotten, part of neuroepidemiology is experimental neuroepidemiology, which is research based on [[clinical trial]]s of effectiveness or efficacy of various interventions in neurological disorders.

In 1982, [[Karger Publishers|Karger]] set up a new [[scientific journal|journal]] entitled "[[Neuroepidemiology (journal)|Neuroepidemiology]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karger.com/ned Neuroepidemiology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This periodical is the only international journal devoted to the study of neurological disease distribution and determinants of frequency in human populations.

Since the time of its inception in 1982, the scope of "Neuroepidemiology" journal has evolved considerably. At present, the journal publishes manuscripts on ''all aspects of epidemiology'' of neurological disorders, ''including'' clinical trials and [[systematic reviews]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ArtikelNr=113298&amp;Ausgabe=234526&amp;ProduktNr=224263&amp;filename=113298.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary focus is on chronic and acute neurological disorders of major importance to clinical medicine, [[public health]], and [[health care delivery]]. The journal also welcomes manuscripts dealing with [[research methodology|methodological]] issues in neuroepidemiological studies.

== Congresses ==
{{update|date=April 2013}}
To reflect modern achievements in our knowledge in non-experimental and experimental (clinical trials) epidemiology of neurological disorders, the First International Congress of Clinical Neuroepidemiology is planned to be held in 2009. This International Congress, for the first time, will bring together scientists and experts in all major fields of experimental and non-experimental neuroepidemiology. Combining scientific sessions in these two interrelated fields of neuroepidemiology with two corresponding half-day teaching courses and a one year-free on-line subscription to the journal of "Neuroepidemiology" for all registered participants are additional unique features of the Congress.

The main topics of the Congress that will be addressed during plenary, platform and poster sessions include stroke, TIA, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, [[traumatic brain injury]], peripheral neuropathy, neuromuscular disorders, central nervous system infections and tumours, neurological aspects of aging, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatric disorders. The Congress will feature internationally recognized invited speakers, platform lectures, short oral presentations and poster sessions, and will provide an ideal platform for continuing education in all fields of experimental and non-experimental clinical neuroepidemiology.

To reflect modern achievements in our knowledge in non-experimental and experimental (clinical trials) epidemiology of neurological disorders, the First International Congress of Clinical Neuroepidemiology will be held in Munich, Germany on August 27–30, 2009 (www.neuro2009.com).

[[File:Baiyun, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China - panoramio (33).jpg|thumb|An urban fringe village located in [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou]], China.]]

The '''rural–urban fringe''', also known as the '''outskirts''', '''rurban''', '''peri-urban'''  or the '''urban hinterland''', can be described as the "'''landscape interface''' between town and country",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311091656/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or also as the transition zone where urban and rural uses mix and often clash.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The porn Reappraisal'. ''Ethnography'', Sept 2010, 11, 331-357&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.

== Definition ==

Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterised by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples:

* Roads, especially motorways and bypasses
* Waste transfer stations, [[recycling]] facilities and landfill sites
* [[Park and ride]] sites
* Airports
* Large hospitals
* Power, water and sewerage facilities
* Factories
* Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets

Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of [[Natural England]]) together with Groundwork, a community and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi-functional urban fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001  Green Infrastructure
and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation of this vision would{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of '[[ecosystem services]]'. It is estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[United States]] urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/fedreg/fedregv76n164.pdf| title=Urban Area Criteria for the 2010 Census; Notice| author=Department of Commerce - Census Bureau| work=Federal Register| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| date=August 24, 2011| access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Science and Civilisation in China''''' (1954–[2016]) is a series of books initiated and edited by British [[biochemist]], [[historian]] and [[sinologist]] [[Joseph Needham| Joseph Needham, Ph.D]] (1900–1995). Needham was a well-respected scientist before undertaking this encyclopedia and was even responsible for the "S" in [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/20/archives/joseph-needham-the-real-thing.html|title=Joseph Needham, the Real Thing|last=Boston|first=Richard|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with the [[history of science and technology in China]]. To date there have been seven volumes in twenty-seven books. The series was on the Modern Library Board's [[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|100 Best Nonfiction]] books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Library, 1999. [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnonfiction.html 100 Best Nonfiction."]&lt;/ref&gt; Needham's work was the first of its kind to praise Chinese scientific contributions and provide their history and connection to global knowledge in contrast to eurocentric historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Stefan Gaarsmand|date=2013|title=Chinese Influences or Images?: Fluctuating Histories of How Enlightenment Europe Read China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=3|pages=623–660|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Needham—along with an international team of collaborators—initiated the project to study the science, technology, and civilisation of ancient China. This project produced a series of volumes published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The project is still  continuing under the guidance of the Publications Board of the [[Needham Research Institute]] (NRI), chaired by [[Christopher Cullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nri.cam.ac.uk/science.html|title=Science and Civilisation in China|publisher=Needham Research Institute|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 of the encyclopedia was the first body of work to describe Chinese improvements to [[cartography]], [[geology]], [[seismology]] and [[mineralogy]]. It also includes descriptions of nautical technology, sailing charts, and wheel-maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779676|title=Science and civilisation in China|last=1900-1995,|first=Needham, Joseph,|others=Wang, Ling, 1917-1994., Métailie, Georges., Huang, H. T.|isbn=052105799X|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=779676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham's transliteration of [[Chinese characters]] uses the [[Wade-Giles]] system, though the aspirate apostrophe (e.g., ''ch'i'') was rendered 'h' (viz. ''chhi''; traditional Chinese: 氣; Mandarin Pinyin: ''[[qì]]''). However, it was abandoned in favor of the [[pinyin]] system by the NRI board in April 2004, with Volume 5, Part 11 becoming the first to use the new system.&lt;ref&gt;volume 5, part 11, page xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Joseph Needham with Chinese History and Sciences scholars, 1988.jpg|thumb|Joseph Needham, in 1988, surrounded by Chinese History and Sciences scholars.]]

=== Development ===
[[Joseph Needham]]’s interest in the history of Chinese science developed while he worked as an Embryologist at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Needham had already published works relating to the history of science, including his 1934 book titled ''[[A History of Embryology]]'', and was open to expanding his historical scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=92 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s first encounter with Chinese culture occurred in 1937 when three Chinese medical students arrived to work with him at the Cambridge Biochemical Laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=409 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s interest in Chinese civilization and scientific progress grew as a result and led him to learn Chinese from his students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two of those students,[[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], would later become his collaborators on ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brook |first1=Timothy |title=The Sinology of Joseph Needham |journal=Modern China |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=3 |page=341 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/009770049602200304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, China’s eastern universities were forced to relocate to the west as a result of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winchester|first1=Simon|date=2008|title=The man who unveiled China|url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7203|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese academics sought the help of the British government in an effort to preserve their intellectual life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1942, Needham was selected and appointed as a diplomat by the British government and tasked with traveling to China and assessing the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years there, Needham discovered that the Chinese had developed techniques and mechanisms which were centuries older than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Needham became concerned with the exclusion of China in the history of science and began to question why the Chinese ceased to develop new techniques after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Publication ===
Armed with his new-found knowledge, Needham returned to Cambridge in 1948 and began working on a book with one of the Chinese medical students he met in Cambridge, [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], who was now a professor at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=883 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he planned on releasing only one volume of his findings through the Cambridge University Press, but later changed his mind and proposed up to eleven volumes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1954, Needham published the first volume of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', which was well received and was followed by other volumes which focused on specific scientific fields and topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=93 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham, along with his collaborators, was personally involved in all of the volumes of Science and Civilization, up until Needham’s death in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Needham’s death, Cambridge University established an institution named after Needham, The [[Needham Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=411 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the institution continue Needham’s work and have published 8 additional volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', since his death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Summaries==
There have been two summaries or condensations of the vast amount of material found in ''Science and Civilisation''. The first, a one-volume [[popular history]] book by [[Robert K. G. Temple|Robert Temple]]  entitled ''The Genius of China'', was completed in a little over 12 months to be available in 1986 for the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to China. This addressed only the contributions made by China and had a "warm welcome" from Joseph Needham in the introduction, though in the ''Beijing Review'' he criticized that it had "some mistakes ... and various statements that I would like to have seen expressed rather differently".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|journal=Beijing Review|url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/beijing_review.pdf|title=East-West: Bridging the Scientific Chasm|author=Ling Yuan|date=Mar 23, 1987|accessdate=2011-02-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A second was made by [[Colin Ronan]], a writer on the history of science, who produced a five volume condensation ''The Shorter Science and Civilisation: An abridgement of Joseph Needham's original text'', between 1980 and his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Colin Ronan|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980–95}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes cover:
# China and Chinese science
# Mathematics, astronomy, meteorology and the earth sciences
# Magnetism, nautical technology, navigation, voyages
# Mechanical engineering, machines, clockwork, windmills, aeronautics
# Civil engineering, roads, bridges, hydraulic engineering

==Reception==

=== Criticism from Scholars ===
''Science and Civilisation in China '' is highly regarded among scholars because of its extensive comparative coverage of Chinese innovations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finlay, Robert. "China, the West, and World History in Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China." ''Journal of World History'', vol. 11 no. 2, 2000, pp. 265-303. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/jwh.2000.0035&lt;/ref&gt; Needham spent a large amount of time translating, and decoding primary sources for ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of his efforts helped to confirm that scientific advancements, and analytical ingenuity were abundant in [[China]] in early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Peter C."Joseph Needham's Problematic Legacy." ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 47 no. 1, 2006, pp. 175-178. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/tech.2006.0092&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, beginning with his first volume, some scholars in the [[Science|scientific]], [[history of science]], and [[sinology]] fields criticized Needham’s work for being too comparative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his work, Needham wrote that numerous Chinese inventions ended up in the west, including the [[Compass|magnetic compass]], and the [[Clock|mechanical clock]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham also wrote that once these inventions reached [[Europe]], they had a great impact on social life, and helped to stimulate the economy, as well as usher in the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars criticized his [[Marxism|Marxist]] background, his understanding of Chinese culture, and his methodology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dr. of History Roger Hart wrote "A Post-Needham Critique" in an East Asia journal accusing Needham of attributing scientific achievements to Chinese civilization in contrast to evidence by exaggerating claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Roger|date=1999|title=Beyond Science and Civilization: A Post-Needham Critique|jstor=43150558|journal=East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=16|pages=88–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor of Volume 6, [[Nathan Sivin]] and Needham's research collaborator [[Lu Gwei-djen]] include updated research to support some of Needham's claims. However, Sivin is critical of Needham suggesting more research is required citing his assumptions of Taoisms' role in promoting scientific feats in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199920082-0006|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=2013-04-22|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Acclaim ===
Needham's ''Science and Civilisation in China'' did not receive criticism from scholars in other fields of study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Groff Conklin]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1955 said that Vol. 1 "presents a richly patterned tapestry of the development of civilization in the Far East", and that "it is for everyone who is intrigued by the unknown, whether future (science fiction) or past (scientific history)".&lt;ref name="conklin195503"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Jonathan Spence]] wrote in a 1982 [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article "this work is the most ambitious undertaking in Chinese studies during this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/books/the-china-the-west-knew-nothing-about.html|title=THE CHINA THE WEST KNEW NOTHING ABOUT|last=Spence|first=Jonathan|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times obituary for Needham stated that those educated in China hail Dr. Needham's encyclopedia and compare him to [[Charles Darwin]] in terms of importance regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/obituaries/joseph-needham-china-scholar-from-britain-dies-at-94.html|title=Joseph Needham, China Scholar From Britain, Dies at 94|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Arun Bala, the author of ''[[The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science]],'' Needham postulates that scientific knowledge may evolve to more closely resemble Chinese philosophical views of nature; signifying his belief in Chinese inherent wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bala|first=Arun|date=2006|title=The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230601215|doi=10.1057/9780230601215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Needham Question ==

=== Origins ===
After his extensive research of Chinese innovations, [[Joseph Needham]] became concerned with the question: Why did modern science stop developing in China after the 16th century?&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Needham believed this was due to [[China]]’s sociopolitical system which was not affected by Chinese inventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[China]] did not have a structure in which merchants could profit off of their inventions, unlike the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once Chinese inventions reached [[Europe]], they revolutionized their sociopolitical system, which used the inventions to dominate political rivals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Needham, Chinese innovations, such as [[gunpowder]], the [[compass]], [[paper]], and [[printing]], helped transform European [[Feudalism]] into [[Capitalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, [[Europe]] was actively financing scientific discoveries, and nautical exploration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[paradox]] of this conclusion was that [[Europe]] surpassed [[China]] in scientific innovations, using Chinese technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Re-formulation ===
After several volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'' had been published, Needham was questioned about his theory of the origin of science in the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham, troubled by past criticism and dismissal of his work as [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, declined to publicly state his relationship to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, in Needham’s work ''[[The Grand Titration]],'' he re-framed his question as: ''“why, between the first century BC and the fifteenth century AD, Chinese civilization was much more efficient than occidental in applying human natural knowledge to practical human needs”''&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. “Science and Society in East and West.” In ''The Grand Titration: Science and Society in East and West''. By Joseph Needham, 190–217. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1969a.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformulation of the question, changed the narrative of ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, the question centered around [[China]]’s failure to develop scientifically after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The focus shifted towards an examination of China’s accomplishments prior to development in Europe, this focus was addressed throughout ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0006.xml#obo-9780199920082-0006-bibItem-0003|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued Debate ===
Needham's attempt to uncover the reasoning behind China's rise and fall as an elite scientific and technologically advanced nation has been expounded upon and debated for decades including [[Justin Yifu Lin]]'s [[University of Chicago Press|University of Chicago]] journal article "The Needham Puzzle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=January 1995|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/452150|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientistic materialism''' is a philosophical stance which posits a limited definition of [[consciousness]] to that which is observable and subject to the [[scientific method]]. The term is used as a pejorative by proponents of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]].

==History==
The "[[Wedge Document]]" produced by the [[Discovery Institute]], described "materialism" as denial of "the proposition that human beings are created in the image of God," and that humans are instead "animals or machines who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of biology, chemistry and environment." The document states that materialism leads inevitably to "[[moral relativism]]" and denounce its "stifling dominance" in modern culture. By this definition, scientific materialism is linked to the more general version of [[materialism]] which declares that the physical world is the only thing that exists and that nothing [[supernatural]] exists.

The U.S. allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation, embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-national-automated-highway-system-that-almost-was-63027245/|title=The National Automated Highway System That Almost Was|last=Novak|first=Matt|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove {{convert|4,584|km}} across America in 1995, {{convert|4,501|km}} or 98% of it autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/slideshow/back_to_the_future_autonomous_driving_in_1995/|title=Back to the Future: Autonomous Driving in 1995 – Robotics Business Review|date=2015-04-03|work=Robotics Business Review|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an  Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over {{convert|5,472|km}} through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/delphi-autonomous-car-cross-country/|title=This Is Big: A Robo-Car Just Drove Across the Country|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the US states of [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Virginia]], and [[Michigan]], together with [[Washington, D.C.]], allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/article_b1168b67-3b2b-5274-8914-8a3304f2e417.html|title=Self-driving cars to be tested on Virginia highways|last=Ramsey|first=John|date=1 June 2015|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Audi stated that its latest [[Audi A8|A8]] would be automated at speeds of up to {{convert|60|km/h}} using its "Audi AI."

==Definitions==

There is some inconsistency in terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.

Such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that "Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS at or above level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS)."

===Words definition and safety considerations===

Modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. Nonetheless, differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|driver assistance technologies]] on the other hand. According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44159581|title=Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?|first=Theo|last=Leggett|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word ''autonomous'' in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous, because car ads make motorists think 'autonomous' and 'autopilot' means a vehicle can drive itself, when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.

When some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are ''self-driving'', when they are only partly automated, drivers risk becoming excessively confident, leading to crashes, while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44439523|title=Insurers warning on 'autonomous' cars|first=Rory|last=Cellan-Jones|date=12 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autonomous vs. automated ===
''Autonomous'' means self-governing.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antsaklis|first1=Panos J.|last2=Passino|first2=Kevin M.|last3=Wang|first3=S.J.|year=1991|title=An Introduction to Autonomous Control Systems|url=http://neuron-ai.tuke.sk/hudecm/PDF_PAPERS/Intro-Aut-Control.pdf|journal=IEEE Control Systems|volume=11|issue=4|pages=5–13|doi=10.1109/37.88585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been ''automated'' (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction" /&gt;

One approach is to implement [[communication networks]] both in the immediate vicinity (for [[Collision avoidance system|collision avoidance]]) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.

Wood et al. (2012) wrote, "This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' " The term "autonomous" was chosen "because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver’s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts."&lt;ref name="Woodetal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=S. P.|last2=Chang|first2=J.|last3=Healy|first3=T.|last4=Wood|first4=J.|title=The potential regulatory challenges of increasingly autonomous motor vehicles.|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2734&amp;context=lawreview|journal=52nd Santa Clara Law Review|volume=4|issue=9|pages=1423–1502}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime.

Put in the words of one Nissan engineer, "A truly autonomous car would be one where you request it to take you to work and it decides to go to the beach instead."&lt;ref name="Autotrader"&gt;{{cite |title=Automated vs. Autonomous Vehicles: Is There a Difference? |url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/automated-vs-autonomous-vehicles-there-difference-273139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EuroNCAP defines autonomous in "Autonomous Emergency Braking" as: "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident." which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-rewards-explained/autonomous-emergency-braking/|title=Autonomous Emergency Braking – Euro NCAP|website=www.euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous versus cooperative===

To make a car travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some system makers used a remote driver.

But according to SAE J3016, {{quote|Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.}}

===Self-driving car===

NHTSA definition is: {{quote|Let’s be clear: fully automated or “self-driving” vehicles aren’t arriving in showrooms tomorrow; they’re likely years, maybe even decades, away.

According to Techemergence {{quote|This means the vehicle can safely drive itself under specific conditions but the driver will need to quickly intervene when called on. This is a car that could drive itself on the highway while you watch a movie but would need you to take control when you get off the highway. Some may view this as only partially self-driving. |Techemergence,&lt;ref name="techemergence" /&gt; July 2018}}

A classification system based on six different levels (ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems) was published in 2014 by [[SAE International]], an automotive standardization body, as J3016, ''Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files/adaptive/content/downloads/Deliverables%20%26%20papers/AdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|title=AdaptIVe system classification and glossary on Automated driving|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007124740/https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files%2Fadaptive%2Fcontent%2Fdownloads%2FDeliverables%20%26%20papers%2FAdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|archive-date=7 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|title=AUTOMATED DRIVING LEVELS OF DRIVING AUTOMATION ARE DEFINED IN NEW SAE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD J3016|date= 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120142825/http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle capabilities, although these are very loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Releases+Policy+on+Automated+Vehicle+Development|title=U.S. Department of Transportation Releases Policy on Automated Vehicle Development|date=30 May 2013|work=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|access-date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.&lt;ref&gt;SAE International&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levels of driving automation ====
In SAE's automation level definitions, "driving mode" means "a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)"&lt;ref name="SAE_definitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903105244/https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 September 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 0: Automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.
* Level 1 ("hands on"): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are [[Adaptive Cruise Control]] (ACC), where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed; and [[Automatic Parking|Parking Assistance]], where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assistance]] (LKA) Type II is a further example of level 1 self-driving.
* Level 2 ("hands off"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and [[lane centering|steering]]). The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand "hands off" is not meant to be taken literally. In fact, contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene.
* Level 3 ("eyes off"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. As an example, the 2018 Audi A8 Luxury Sedan was the first commercial car to claim to be capable of level 3 self-driving. This particular car has a so-called Traffic Jam Pilot. When activated by the human driver, the car takes full control of all aspects of driving in slow-moving traffic at up to {{convert|60|km/h}}. The function works only on highways with a physical barrier separating one stream of traffic from oncoming traffic.
* Level 4 ("mind off"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas ([[Geo-fence|geofenced]]) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.
* Level 5 ("steering wheel optional"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi.

In the formal SAE definition below, note in particular what happens in the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3: the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment. This is the final aspect of the "dynamic driving task" that is now passed over from the human to the automated system. At SAE 3, the human driver still has the responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.

==Legal definition==
In the District of Columbia (DC) code, {{quote|“Autonomous vehicle” means a vehicle capable of navigating District roadways and interpreting traffic-control devices without a driver actively operating any of the vehicle’s control systems. The term “autonomous vehicle” excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver- assistance systems, including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, lane-departure warning, or traffic-jam and queuing assistance, unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator.}}

In the same district code, it is considered that:

{{quote|An autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway; provided, that the vehicle:
* (1) Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time;
* (2) Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment; and
* (3) Is capable of operating in compliance with the District’s applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices.}}

== Semi-automated vehicles ==
Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of [[Vehicular automation|automation]]. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure is developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.

== Technical challenges==
{{Main|Hybrid navigation}}
The challenge for driverless car designers is to produce control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Wentao|last2=Miao|first2=Jun|last3=Hu|first3=Jiangbi|last4=Qing|first4=Laiyun|date=27 March 2014|title=Vehicle detection in driving simulation using extreme learning machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231213010126|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=128|pages=160–165|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2013.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern self-driving cars generally use [[Bayes' theorem|Bayesian]] [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) algorithms,&lt;ref name="IEEE1"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine |title=Simultaneous localization and mapping | volume= 13|issue= 2 |pages= 99–110 |date=5 June 2006 |issn=1070-9932 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1638022/ |doi=10.1109/mra.2006.1638022 | last1 = Durrant-Whyte | first1 = H. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside [[real-time locating system]] (RTLS) technologies to aid localization.

Driverless vehicles require some form of [[machine vision]] for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with [[deep neural networks]],&lt;ref name="arxiv"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Huval|first1=Brody|last2=Wang|first2=Tao|last3=Tandon|first3=Sameep|last4=Kiske|first4=Jeff|last5=Song|first5=Will|last6=Pazhayampallil|first6=Joel|title=An Empirical Evaluation of Deep Learning on Highway Driving|arxiv=1504.01716}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[deep learning]] architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Deep learning in neural networks: An overview|journal=Neural Networks|date=January 2015|volume=61|pages=85–117|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014002135|access-date=29 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003|arxiv=1404.7828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,&lt;ref name="arxiv"/&gt; enabling the neural network to "learn" how to execute the best course of action.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt;

In May 2018, researchers from MIT announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/13/17340494/mit-self-driving-car-unmapped-country-rural-road|title=MIT built a self-driving car that can navigate unmapped country roads|website=www.theverge.com|first=Andrew J.|last=Hawkins|date=13 May 2018|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a "sparse topological map" such as [[OpenStreetMap]], (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2018/self-driving-cars-for-country-roads-mit-csail-0507|title=Self-driving cars for country roads: Today's automated vehicles require hand-labeled 3-D maps, but CSAIL's MapLite system enables navigation with just GPS and sensors.|first1=Adam|last1=Connor-Simons|first2=Rachel|last2=Gordon|date=7 May 2018|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the digital technology ==
Autonomous vehicles, as a digital technology, have certain characteristics that distinguishes them from other types of technologies and vehicles. Due to these characteristics, autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects: homogenization and decoupling, connectivity, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Homogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also implies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Due to homogenization, the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way. This implies that all digital information comes in the same form, which means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard- and software (Moore's law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the  marginal costs.;

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even (other) enterprises. In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other ‘devices’ in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connects and manages each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for...|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655&amp;videoChannel=6|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.;

=== Reprogrammable and smart ===
Another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, cause through machine learning (smart) autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can be continuously be improved.;

=== Digital traces ===
Autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles’ driving ability or safety.

=== Modularity ===
Traditional vehicles and their accompanying (traditional) technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.

* (1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides the control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;
* (2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables computational power of a network or platform.;
* (3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and
* (4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos the autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content's origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).
The consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop a more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.}}

== Human factor challenges ==
Alongside the many technical challenges that autonomous cars face, there exist many human and social factors that may impede upon the wider uptake of the technology. As things become more automated, the human users need to have trust in the automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Trust in Automation – Before and After the Experience of Take-over Scenarios in a Highly Automated Vehicle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915008483|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=3025–3032|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.847|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be a challenge in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/08/survey-data-suggests-self-driving-cars-could-be-slow-to-gain-consumer-trust/|title=Survey Data Suggests Self-Driving Cars Could Be Slow To Gain Consumer Trust|work=GM Authority|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weather may also affect the car sensors, which may affect the auto driving mode. When heavy rainfall, heavy storms, heavy snowfall affect or damage the car sensors. Because of this, the performance of the car decreases gradually and the chance of accidents increases.

== Testing ==
Testing vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be done physically, in closed environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.umich.edu/|title=Mcity testing center|date=8 December 2016|work=University of Michigan|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads (where permitted, typically with a license or permit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing|title=Adopted Regulations for Testing of Autonomous Vehicles by Manufacturers|date=18 June 2016|work=DMV|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adhering to a specific set of operating principles)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automated-vehicle-technologies-testing-code-of-practice|title=The Pathway to Driverless Cars: A Code of Practice for testing|date=19 July 2015|access-date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or virtually, i.e. in computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/index|title=Automobile simulation example|date=18 June 2018|work=Cyberbotics|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and "take over" when needed. For example, New York State has strict requirements for the test driver so that at all times the vehicle can be corrected by a licensed driver; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company's application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.&lt;ref&gt;https://dmv.ny.gov/dmv/apply-autonomous-vehicle-technology-demonstration-testing-permit&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple is currently testing self-driven cars, and has increased the number of test vehicles from 3 to 27 in January 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=Andrew|title=Apple increases self-driving test fleet from 3 to 27|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-increases-self-driving-test-fleet-from-3-to-27/|website=Roadshow|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 45 in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Zac|title=Apple ramping self-driving car testing, more CA permits than Tesla and Uber|url=https://electrek.co/2018/03/20/apple-autonomous-car-testing-progress/|website= [[Electrek]] |access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to assess the progress of automated vehicles is to compute the average distance driven between "disengagements", when the automated system is turned off, typically by a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over {{convert|352545|mi}} of testing, or {{convert|5596|mi}} on average, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled more distance in total than any other. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} was an improvement from 0.2 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} in 2016 and 0.8 in 2015. In March, 2017, Uber reported an average of {{convert|0.67|mi}} per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, [[Cruise Automation]] (now owned by [[General Motors|GM]]) averaged {{convert|5224|mi}} per disruption over {{convert|62689|mi}}.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/03/uber-self-driving-system-was-still-400-times-worse-waymo-in-2018-on-key-distance-intervention-metric.html|title=Uber' self-driving system was still 400 times worse [than] Waymo in 2018 on key distance intervention metric|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=25 March 2018|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car "Robocar" completed 1.8 kilometers track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/07/16/first-self-driving-race-car-completes-1-8-kilometre-track|title=First self-driving race car completes 1.8 kilometre track|date=2018-07-16|work=euronews|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of application==
=== Automated trucks ===
Several companies are said to be testing automated technology in [[Semi-trailer truck|semi]] trucks. [[Otto (company)|Otto]], a self-driving trucking company that was acquired by Uber in August 2016, demonstrated their trucks on the highway before being acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/uber-acquires-otto-to-lead-ubers-self-driving-car-effort-report-says|title=Uber acquires Otto to lead Uber's self-driving car effort|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|first=Romain|last=Dillet|date=18 August 2016|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, San Francisco-based startup Embark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embarktrucks.com/|title=Embark – Self-Driving Semi Trucks|website=www.embarktrucks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced a partnership with truck manufacturer [[Peterbilt]] to test and deploy automated technology in Peterbilt's vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/self-driving-truck-startup-embark-raises-15m-partners-with-peterbilt/|title=Self-driving truck startup Embark raises $15M, partners with Peterbilt|first=Darrell|last=Etherington|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=18 July 2017|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waymo has also said to be testing automated technology in trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-waymo-selfdriving-truck/waymo-working-on-self-driving-trucks-idUSKBN18T04V|title=Waymo working on self-driving trucks|last=|first=|date=1 June 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no timeline has been given for the project.

In March 2018, [[Starsky Robotics]], the San Francisco-based automated truck company, completed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=mid}} fully driverless trip in Florida without a single human in the truck. Starsky Robotics became the first player in the self-driving truck game to drive in fully automated mode on a public road without a person in the cab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccjdigital.com/starsky-robotics-autonomous-run-without-driver/#|title=Truck completes fully automated route without driver in cab|website=www.ccjdigital.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, truck [[Platoon (automobile)|platooning]] is being considered with the [[Safe Road Trains for the Environment]] approach.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Lockheed Martin with funding from the U.S. Army developed an automated truck convoying system that uses a lead truck operated by a human driver with a number of trucks following autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/2012/10/lockheed-martin-wins-contract-to-develop-autonomous-operation-of-tactical-vehicles/|title=Lockheed Martin Wins Contract to Develop Autonomous Operation of Tactical Vehicles {{!}} Unmanned Systems Technology|date=2012-10-25|work=Unmanned Systems Technology|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed as part of the Army's Autonomous Mobility Applique System (AMAS), the system consists of an automated driving package that has been installed on more than nine types of vehicles and has completed more than 55,000 hours of driving at speeds up to {{convert|64|km/h}} as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.military.com/defensetech/2017/03/30/driverless-convoy-technology-fielded|title=Driverless Convoy Technology May Be Fielded Soon|date=2017-03-30|work=Military.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 the Army was planning to field 100–200 trucks as part of a rapid-fielding program.

=== Transport systems ===
In Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/brief/rcn/10263_en.html|title=Driverless cars take to the road|publisher=E.U.CORDIS Research Program CitynetMobil|access-date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131227/POLITICS02/312270067/1148/rss25|title=Snyder OKs self-driving vehicles on Michigan's roads|date=27 December 2013|publisher=Detroit News|access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28551069|title=BBC News – UK to allow driverless cars on public roads in January|work=BBC News|access-date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic.

In China, [[Baidu]] and [[King Long]] produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China. Those minibuses should be at level 4, that is driverless in closed roads.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Potential advantages ==

=== Safety ===
Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, [[traffic collision]]s (and [[Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions|resulting deaths and injuries]] and costs), caused by [[human error]], such as delayed [[Stopping sight distance|reaction time]], [[Tail gating|tailgating]], [[rubbernecking]], and other forms of [[Distracted driving|distracted]] or [[aggressive driving]] should be substantially reduced.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theenergycollective.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitwam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/business/economy/29view.html|title=Can I See Your License, Registration and C.P.U.?|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|date=28 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] estimated that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could "eliminate 90% of all auto accidents in the United States, prevent up to {{USD|190 billion}} in damages and health-costs annually and save thousands of lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-cut-down-on-accidents-study-says-1425567905|title=Self-Driving Cars Could Cut Down on Accidents, Study Says|last=Ramsey|first=Mike|date=3 May 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to motorist website "TheDrive.com" operated by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact were able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrive.com/opinion/7324/the-way-we-talk-about-autonomy-is-a-lie-and-thats-dangerous|title=The Way We Talk About Autonomy Is a Lie, and That's Dangerous|first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey|website=www.thedrive.com|date=8 March 2017|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners.

One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (~8,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 445% from 2,200&amp;nbsp;pc/h per lane) traveling safely at {{Convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}} with a following gap of about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} of each other. Currently, at highway speeds drivers keep between {{convert|40|to|50|m|abbr=on|ft}} away from the car in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/intelligent-cars-could-boost-highway-capacity-by-273|title=Study: Intelligent Cars Could Boost Highway Capacity by 273%|last=Ackerman|first=Evan|date=4 September 2012|work=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE)|publisher=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for authorities to manage [[traffic flow]] would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability&lt;ref name="Gibson" /&gt; combined with less need for [[traffic police]] and even [[road signage]].

===Lower costs===
Safer driving is expected to reduce the costs of [[vehicle insurance]].&lt;ref name="Light" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_lwq3BfkY|title=Autonomous Intersection Management – FCFS policy with 6 lanes in all directions|date=12 June 2009|publisher=YouTube|access-date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will also translate into better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel efficiency]].&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/self-driving-cars-could-cut-greenhouse-gas-pollution/|title=Self-Driving Cars Could Cut Greenhouse Gas Pollution|last=Pyper|first=Julia|date=15 September 2015|work=[[Scientific American]]|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ensia.com/features/are-self-driving-vehicles-good-for-the-environment/|title=ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?|last=Wang|first=Ucilia|date=17 August 2015|publisher=Ensia|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed (energy typically lost due to friction, in the form of heat and sound).

=== Parking space ===
Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4–5% time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95–96% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/spaced-out-perspectives-on-parking|title=Spaced Out parking report|website=www.racfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html|title="Cars are parked 95% of the time".

=== Related effects ===
By reducing the (labor and other) cost of [[Transportation as a Service|mobility as a service]], automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/03/04/mckinsey-self-driving-benefits/24382405/|title=McKinsey study: Self-driving cars yield big benefits|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|date=5 March 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kpmg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/self-driving-cars-next-revolution.pdf|title=Self-driving cars: The next revolution|date=5 September 2013|publisher=kpmg.com|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects. Assuming the increased efficiency is not fully offset by increases in demand, more efficient traffic flow could free roadway space for other uses such as better support for pedestrians and cyclists.

The vehicles' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behavior, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, this may also lead to much expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.

== Potential limits or obstacles  ==
The sort of hoped-for potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described  may be limited by foreseeable challenges, such as disputes over liability (will each company operating  a vehicle accept that they are its "driver" and thus responsible for what their car does, or will some try to project this liability onto others who are not in control?),&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/nhtsa-chief-takes-conservative-view-on-autonomous-vehicles/|title=NHTSA chief takes conservative view on autonomous vehicles: "If you had perfect, connected autonomous vehicles on the road tomorrow, it would still take 20 to 30 years to turn over the fleet."|last=Nichols|first=Greg|date=13 February 2016|work=ZDNet|access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to having to forfeit control of their cars,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; concerns about the safety of driverless in practice,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/09/24/will-regulators-allow-self-driving-cars-in-a-few-years/|title=Will Regulators Allow Self-Driving Cars In A Few Years?|date=24 September 2013|work=Forbes|access-date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/18/5120270/reliance-on-autopilot-is-now-the-biggest-threat-to-flight-safety|title=Reliance on autopilot is now the biggest threat to flight safety, study says|date=18 November 2013|access-date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ethical problems where an automated vehicle's software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action ('the [[trolley problem]]'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/|title=The Ethics of Autonomous Cars|author=Patrick Lin|date=8 October 2013|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/06/18/when-should-your-driverless-car-from-google-be-allowed-to-kill-you/|title=When Should Your Driverless Car From Google Be Allowed To Kill You?|author=Tim Worstall|date=18 June 2014|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00426/full|title=Forced-choice decision-making in modified trolley dilemma situations: a virtual reality and eye tracking study|author1=Alexander Skulmowski|author2=Andreas Bunge|date=16 December 2014|publisher=Front.

== Potential disadvantages ==

The lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where land is cheaper, and work in the city's core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more [[urban sprawl]], more fuel consumption and an increase in the [[carbon footprint]] of urban travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/the-downside-of-driverless-cars-20151105-gkro8y.html|title=The downside of driverless cars|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=5 November 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprawl"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/tesla-self-driving-car-sprawl/|title=Whoops: The Self-Driving Tesla May Make Us Love Urban Sprawl Again|last=Ufberg|first=Max|date=15 October 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt; Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprawl" /&gt;

Hamish Jamson. "[http://drivingassessment.uiowa.edu/DA2009/072_MeratJamson.pdf HOW DO DRIVERS BEHAVE IN A HIGHLY AUTOMATED CAR?] " Institute for Transport Studies University of Leeds. Quote: "Drivers' response to all critical events was found to be much later in the automated driving condition, compared to manual driving."&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.

Ethical and moral reasoning come into consideration when programming the software that decides what action the car takes in an unavoidable crash; whether the automated car will crash into a bus, potentially killing people inside; or swerve elsewhere, potentially killing its own passengers or nearby pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Self-driving cars programmed to decide who dies in a crash|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/23/self-driving-cars-programmed-decide-who-dies-crash/891493001/|website=USA Today|publisher=Detroit Free Press|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A question that programmers of AI systems find difficult to answer (as do ordinary people, and ethicists) is "what decision should the car make that causes the ‘smallest’ damage to people's lives?" One proposed solution is the implementation of ethics bots in self-driving vehicles, which learn from user preferences to ultimately guide autonomous instruments in accordance with the owner's values and preferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|last2=Etzioni|first2=Oren|title=Incorporating Ethics into Artificial Intelligence|journal=The Journal of Ethics|date=December 2017|volume=21|issue=4|page=403–418|doi=10.1007/s10892-017-9252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of automated vehicles are still being articulated, and may lead to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodall|first1=Noah|title=Can you program ethics into a self-driving car?|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=June 2016|pages=25–28|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7473149|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7473149|access-date=29 November 2017|volume=53|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also require closer consideration of the variability, context-dependency, complexity and non-deterministic nature of human ethics. Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving, such as avoiding harm to themselves, or putting themselves at risk to protect others. These decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence, to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents, road rage and stress.

Human thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash, think through the ethical implications of the available options, or take an action to implement an ethical choice. Whether a particular automated vehicle's capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk, analyse the options or choose a 'good' option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular human's may be difficult to predict or assess. This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario, sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future, and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence, may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple, plain English 'human values' logic of parsable rules. The depth of understanding, predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement, and even harder to test or assess.

The scale of this challenge may have other effects. There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it, as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle, and the legal and 'government affairs' capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents. This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system opertors, and eroding the presently quite diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers.

== Potential changes for different industries ==
The traditional automobile is subject to changes that on the one hand are technology pushed, and on the other hand are demanded by the market. 
Where in the first case the technological discontinuity is fueled by the breakthrough technological innovation described, the second case is driven by the extent to which the market is used to adopting new technologies faster. 
In both cases the end of the era of incremental change was recognized, which is graphically displayed at the point where the transition is made to a new technology above. This point causes new entrants to the automotive industry to present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and nVidia. 
As new entrants to the industry will lead to a certain extent of uncertainty, due to the changing dynamics, the era of ferment will be the next phase in the Technology Life Cycle. With the entrance of tech giants, alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers are entered. This causes a variation in the innovation- and production process of autonomous vehicles. Besides that, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. The increasing extent to which these providers are present in the industry is supported by the flattening curve on the ‘vehicles per capita’ graph. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to this matter and allows forecasters to question whether private ownership of vehicles is still relevant when the dominant design is being selected.

=== Taxi industry ===
With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the private ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue when the dominant design is selected. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841090/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-ces-2018|title=You can take a ride in a self-driving Lyft during CES|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare-, repair-, and insurance industry ===
With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions. Numbers made available by the US government state that 94% of the vehicle accidents is due to human failures. With that in mind, it is safe to say that there is a major implication for the healthcare industry. Numbers of the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on U.S. roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident point out that an estimated 500-billion-dollar loss is accounted for the US healthcare industry only by the time autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. On the positive side, these numbers will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. As collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to preventively replace a part that will fail soon. This ‘Asset Efficiency Service’ would implicate a productivity gain for this business.
As fewer collisions implicate less money spend on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but on the other hand fewer payouts implicate a demand drop for insurances in general. The insurance industry has to come up with new insurance models in the near future.  An unexpected disadvantage would be a reduction in organs available for transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Ian |title=Self-Driving Cars Will Make Organ Shortages Even Worse |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/self-driving-cars-will-exacerbate-organ-shortages.html |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=[[Slate (magazine)]] |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rescue-, emergency- and military industry ===
The technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles within the rescue-, emergency- and military industry already leads to a decrease in death. Military personnel uses autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies, and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows AVs to become more and more autonomous. Also, another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/08/29/the-us-army-is-developing-autonomous-armored-vehicles/|title=The US Army is developing autonomous armored vehicles|last=Snow|first=Shawn|date=2017-08-29|work=Army Times|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interior design- and media-entertainment industry ===
For the interior design industry, there are exciting times ahead. The driver is decreasingly focused on the actual driving, this implies that the interior design- and media-entertainment industry has to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160405203131/https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|title=Driver-less car design: Sleep-walking into the future?|date=2016-04-05|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunication and energy industry ===
As autonomous vehicles are producing enormous amounts of data that need to be transferred and analyzed, the upcoming 5G cellular network will play a pivotal role in doing so. In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.
Since autonomous vehicles are solely going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. This causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication  depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem.

=== Restaurant, hotel and airline industry ===
Driver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/volvos-fully-autonomous-360c-concept-vehicle-even-lets-you-sleep-in-it|title=Volvo’s Fully Autonomous 360c Concept Vehicle Even Lets You Sleep In It|date=2018-09-06|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder, disabled and childcare industry ===
Autonomous vehicles will have a severe impact on the mobility options of persons that are not able to drive a vehicle themselves. To remain socially engaged with society or even able to do groceries, the elderly people of today are depending on caretakers to drive them to these places. In addition to the perceived freedom of the elderly people of the future, the demand for human aides will decrease. When we also consider the increased health of the elderly, it is safe to state that care centers will experience a decrease in the number of clients. Not only elderly people face difficulties of their decreased physical abilities, also disabled people will perceive the benefits of autonomous vehicles in the near future, causing their dependency on caretakers to decrease. Both industries are largely depending on informal caregivers, who are mostly relatives of the persons in need. Since there is less of a reliance on their time, employers of informal caregivers or even governments will experience a decrease of costs allocated to this matter. Children and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves, are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers. The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/why-autonomous-cars-could-be-the-change-disabled-people-1688864804|title=Why Autonomous Cars Could Be The Change Disabled People Need|last=McParland|first=Tom|work=Jalopnik|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Mercedes introduced Distronic, the first [[radar]]-assisted [[Adaptive cruise control system|ACC]], on the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-657477-1-814760-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-614232-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Mercedes-Benz S-Class, W 220 series (1998 to 2005)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-658451-1-1767861-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Innovation as a tradition|date=27 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229221136/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-658451-1-1767861-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|archivedate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mercedes-Benz C215|CL-Class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1090569-1-823389-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-614318-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Technical highlights of the CL-Class and its predecessor series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Distronic system was able to adjust the vehicle speed automatically to the car in front in order to always maintain a safe distance to other cars on the road.

In 2005, Mercedes refined the system (from this point called "Distronic Plus") with the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221)]] being the first car to receive the upgraded Distronic Plus system. Distronic Plus could now completely halt the car if necessary on E-Class and most Mercedes sedans. In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', [[Jeremy Clarkson]] demonstrated the effectiveness of the cruise control system in the S-class by coming to a complete halt from motorway speeds to a round-about and getting out, without touching the pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clarkson, Jeremy|title=Radar Guided Cruise Control|date=4 July 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU83G3OaJuU|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Mercedes has vastly expanded its automated driving features on production cars: In addition to the standard Distronic Plus features such as an active brake assist, Mercedes now includes a steering pilot, a parking pilot, a cross-traffic assist system, night-vision cameras with automated danger warnings and braking assist (in case animals or pedestrians are on the road for example), and various other automated -driving features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/|title=Welcome to the Mercedes-Benz international website|work=Mercedes-Benz|date=|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/290478/mercedes-benz-e400-distronic-plus-with-steering-assist-demonstrated/|title=Mercedes-Benz E400: Distronic Plus with Steering Assist demonstrated|last=Ward|first=James|date=16 June 2014|website=www.caradvice.com.au|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.daimler.com/2015/03/18/einfach-technik-so-funktioniert-distronic-plus/|title=Daimler-Blog – Einfach Technik: So funktioniert DISTRONIC PLUS|last=Mercedes Blog-Team|first=|date=18 March 2015|website=Daimler-Blog|language=de|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbscottsdale.com/blog/how-to-use-distronic-plus-cruise-control-in-2016-mercedes-benz/|title=How to Use DISTRONIC PLUS Cruise Control in 2016 Mercedes-Benz|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 September 2015|website=www.mbscottsdale.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loebermotors.com/blog/how-to-use-mercedes-benz-distronic-plus/|title=How To Use Mercedes-Benz DISTRONIC PLUS|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 February 2016|website=www.loebermotors.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Mercedes also introduced its Active Brake Assist 4, which was the first emergency braking assistant with pedestrian recognition on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/ko/en/12367326|title=Mercedes-Benz Trucks: Safety: New assistance systems: Active Brake Assist 4 emergency: braking assistant featuring pedestrian recognition and: Sideguard Assist|last=Daimler AG|first=|date=2016|website=media.daimler.com|language=en-EN|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Mercedes' history of gradually implementing advancements of their automated driving features that have been extensively tested, not many crashes that have been caused by it are known. One of the known crashes dates back to 2005, when German [[news magazine]] "''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''" was testing Mercedes' old Distronic system. During the test, the system did not always manage to brake in time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stern.de/tv/stern-tv---rtl-mercedes-s-klasse--panne-bei-crash-test-3290156.html|title=Mercedes S-Klasse: Panne bei Crash-Test|last=|first=|date=16 November 2005|work=Stern|access-date=11 July 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Mellinghoff, then Head of Safety, NVH, and Testing at the Mercedes-Benz Technology Centre, stated that some of the tests failed due to the vehicle being tested in a metallic hall, which caused problems with the system's radar. Later iterations of the Distronic system have an upgraded radar and numerous other sensors, which are not susceptible to a metallic environment anymore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Pedestrian-protection-Not-just-a-question-of-compliance-with-crash-test-regulations-for-Mercedes-Benz.xhtml?oid=9905174|title=Pedestrian protection: Not just a question of compliance with crash-test regulations for Mercedes-Benz|last=|first=|date=|website=media.daimler.com|language=en-EN|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Mercedes conducted a study comparing the crash rates of their vehicles equipped with Distronic Plus and the vehicles without it, and concluded that those equipped with Distronic Plus have an around 20% lower crash rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Jun08/10_001188_Mercedes_Benz_Accident_Study_Shows_20_Percent_Of_Rear_End_Collisions_Can_Be_Avoided_With_DISTRONIC_PLUS_And_Brake_Assist_Plus.html|title=Mercedes-Benz Accident Study Shows 20 Percent Of Rear End Collisions Can Be Avoided With DISTRONIC PLUS and Brake Assist PLUS|last=Philips|first=T.|date=10 June 2008|website=www.emercedesbenz.com|access-date=11 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000057/http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Jun08/10_001188_Mercedes_Benz_Accident_Study_Shows_20_Percent_Of_Rear_End_Collisions_Can_Be_Avoided_With_DISTRONIC_PLUS_And_Brake_Assist_Plus.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, German [[Formula&amp;nbsp;One]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] was invited by Mercedes to try to crash a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|Mercedes C-Class]] vehicle, which was equipped with all safety features that Mercedes offered for its production vehicles at the time, which included the Active Blind Spot Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Brake Assist Plus, Collision Prevention Assist, Distronic Plus with Steering Assist, Pre-Safe Brake, and Stop&amp;Go Pilot. Due to the safety features, Schumacher was unable to crash the vehicle in realistic scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/michael-schumacher-tries-to-crash-a-mercedes-c-class-fails-1579637/|title=Michael Schumacher tries to crash a Mercedes C-Class.

=== Tesla Autopilot ===
{{Main|Tesla Autopilot}}
In mid{{nbhyph}}October 2015, [[Tesla Motors]] rolled out version 7 of their software in the U.S. that included [[Tesla Autopilot]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20151014/OEM06/151019938/tesla-beams-down-autopilot-mode-to-model-s|title=Tesla beams down 'autopilot' mode to Model S|last=Nelson|first=Gabe|date=14 October 2015|work=Automotive News|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] update, adding a new "summon" feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-two-years-car-202858960.html|title=ELON MUSK: In 2 years your Tesla will be able to drive from New York to LA and find you|last=Zhang|first=Benjamin|date=10 January 2016|work=Automotive News|access-date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's automated driving features can be classified as somewhere between level 2 and level 3 under the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) five levels of vehicle automation.

In urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs. The system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists.&lt;ref name="HwyOnly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2016/07/01/first-tesla-autopilot-fatality-demonstrates-why-lidar-and-v2v-probably-will-be-necessary/#73c13b3f3f66|title=Tesla Autopilot Fatality Shows Why Lidar And V2V Will Be Necessary For Autonomous Cars|last=Abuelsamid|first=Sam|date=1 July 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2016, the first known fatal crash of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China's Hubei province. According to China's 163.com news channel, this marked "China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving (system)." Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car's absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver's otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.&lt;ref name="china-fatality"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/783009/the-scary-similarities-between-teslas-tsla-deadly-autopilot-crashes|title=There are some scary similarities between Tesla's deadly crashes linked to Autopilot|publisher=Quartz|first1=Josh|last1=Horwitz|first2=Heather|last2=Timmons|date=20 September 2016|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c.m.163.com/news/a/C0UBU2I0002580S6.html|title=China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving: not hitting the front bumper|language=Chinese|work=[[Media of China|China State Media]]|date=14 September 2016|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim's father documenting that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/two-years-on-a-father-is-still-fighting-tesla-over-aut-1823189786|title=Two Years On, A Father Is Still Fighting Tesla Over Autopilot And His Son's Fatal Crash|first=Ryan|last=Felton|website=jalopnik.com|date=27 February 2018|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in [[Williston, Florida]] on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S [[electric car]] was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel [[tractor-trailer]]. On 28 June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the [[Florida Highway Patrol]]. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck's trailer.&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash01"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk|title=Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode|last1=Yadron|first1=Danny|date=1 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Tynan|first2=Dan|location=[[San Francisco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/self-driving-tesla-fatal-crash-investigation.html|title=Self-Driving Tesla Involved in Fatal Crash|last1=Vlasic|first1=Bill|date=30 June 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Boudette|first2=Neal E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM530776/INOA-PE16007-7080.PDF|title=ODI Resume – Investigation: PE 16-007|author=Office of Defects Investigations, NHTSA|date=28 June 2016|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)|access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2016, the NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla's planned updates schedule for the next four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20160712/OEM06/160719970/nhtsa-seeks-answers-on-fatal-tesla-autopilot-crash|title=NHTSA seeks answers on fatal Tesla Autopilot crash|last=Shepardson|first=David|date=12 July 2016|work=[[Automotive News]]|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tesla, "neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S." Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla's first known autopilot death in over {{convert|130|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every {{convert|94|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} among all type of vehicles in the U.S.&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=A Tragic Loss|date=30 June 2016|publisher=[[Tesla Motors]]|url=https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/tragic-loss|quote=This is the first known fatality in just over 130 million miles where Autopilot was activated.

In July 2016, the U.S. [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said "It's worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20160708/OEM11/307089859/ntsb-to-scrutinize-driver-automation-with-probe-of-tesla-crash|title=NTSB to scrutinize driver automation with probe of Tesla crash|authors=Alan Levin and Jeff Plungis|date=8 July 2016|work=[[Automotive News]]|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323990/tesla-autopilot-fatal-accident-nhtsa-investigation-ends|title=Fatal Tesla Autopilot accident investigation ends with no recall ordered|date=19 January 2016|access-date=19 January 2017|publisher=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navya automated bus driving system ===

On 9 November 2017, a [[Navya SAS|Navya]] automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply [[defensive driving]] such as flash headlights, sound the horn, or as one passenger commented "The shuttle didn't have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/self-driving-bus-crashes-two-hours-after-las-vegas-launch-truck-autonomous-vehicle|title=Self-driving bus involved in crash less than two hours after Las Vegas launch|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=9 November 2017|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy implications ==

===Urban planning===
According to a [[Wonkblog]] reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a [[disruptive innovation]] with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policy makers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt;

One fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt; This may in turn encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership|title=Driverless cars will mean the end of mass car ownership|last1=Lee|first1=Timothy|date=31 January 2015|access-date=31 January 2015|publisher=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of [[smart highway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Randal, Policy Implications of Autonomous Vehicles (18 September 2014). Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 758. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2549392&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on [[Oil dependence|oil imports]] may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinto | first1 = Cyrus | title = How autonomous vehicle policy in California and Nevada addresses technological and non-technological liabilities | url = | journal = Intersect: The Stanford Journal of Science, Technology and Society | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 confounding questions that hold the key to the future of driverless cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=15 January 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policy makers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerra|first=Erick|date=1 June 2016|title=Planning for Cars That Drive Themselves: Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Regional Transportation Plans, and Autonomous Vehicles|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739456X15613591|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=210–224|doi=10.1177/0739456X15613591|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Todd. "Autonomous vehicle implementation predictions." ''Victoria Transport Policy Institute'' 28 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of right now the U.S. Government defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. [[Iyad Rahwan]], an associate professor in the MIT Media lab said, "Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs." Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/retail-revolution/|title=Retail Revolution|last=Humphreys|first=Pat|date=19 August 2016|work=Transport and Travel|access-date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the Convention has been the concept that a [[Driver (person)|driver]] is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050545/https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2017|title=GAR – 1968 Vienna Convention|date=1 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.

====Legal status in the United States====
[[File:Self Driving Cars Legalized States in USA.png|thumb|U.S. states that allow testing of driverless cars on public roads]]
In the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage — but do not necessarily prohibit — highly automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/automated-vehicles-are-probably-legal-united-states|title=Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in The United States|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=1 November 2012|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canis|first1=Bill|title=Issues in Autonomous Vehicle Deployment|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44940.pdf|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action|title=Automated Driving: Legislative and Regulatory Action|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 7 states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the [[District of Columbia]], have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla's Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.

In September 2016, the US [[United States Department of Transportation|National Economic Council]] and [[Department of Transportation]] released federal standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/technology/self-driving-cars-guidelines.html|title=Self-Driving Cars Gain Powerful Ally: The Government|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=19 September 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 September 2016|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Nevada Legislature]] passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the [[Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NDMV) is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.&lt;ref name="GCC0611"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/ab511-20110625.html|title=Nevada enacts law authorizing autonomous (driverless) vehicles|date=25 June 2011|publisher=Green Car Congress|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes0611"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada Passes Law Authorizing Driverless Cars|author=Alex Knapp|date=22 June 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=25 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628165915/http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|archivedate=28 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/06/24/nevada-state-law-paves-the-way-for-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada state law paves the way for driverless cars|author=Christine Dobby|date=24 June 2011|work=[[Financial Post]]|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was supported by [[Google]] in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its [[Google driverless car]].&lt;ref name="NYT0511"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/science/11drive.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1|title=Google Lobbies Nevada To Allow Self-Driving Cars|author=John Markoff|date=10 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nevada law defines an automated vehicle to be "a motor vehicle that uses [[artificial intelligence]], sensors and [[global positioning system]] coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator."

In 2013, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] permitted the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23330681|title=UK to road test driverless cars|date=16 July 2013|access-date=17 July 2013|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, all testing of robotic vehicles in the UK had been conducted on private property.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[Government of France]] announced that testing of automated cars on public roads would be allowed in 2015. 2000&amp;nbsp;km of road would be opened through the national territory, especially in Bordeaux, in Isère, Île-de-France and Strasbourg. At the 2015 ITS World Congress, a conference dedicated to intelligent transport systems, the very first demonstration of automated vehicles on open road in France was carried out in Bordeaux in early October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/des-vehicules-autonomes-sur-route-ouverte-a-bordeaux-en-octobre-2015.N338350|title=Des véhicules autonomes sur route ouverte à Bordeaux en octobre 2015|work=usine-digitale.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liability===
{{main|Self-driving car liability}}

Self-driving car liability is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons, or breaks road rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Laws on Autonomous Vehicles|first=Sean|last=Slone|url=http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/state-laws-autonomous-vehicles|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology, there may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury, and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants, system operator, insurers, and the public purse.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; Increases in the use of automated car technologies (e.g. [[advanced driver-assistance systems]]) may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving. It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents, although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ten ways autonomous driving could redefine the automotive world|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/ten-ways-autonomous-driving-could-redefine-the-automotive-world|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there was a dramatic improvement in safety, the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement.  However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.

In any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.

As higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketplace of change: Automobile insurance in the era of autonomous vehicles|url=https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vehicular communication systems ==
{{main|Vehicular communication systems}}Individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating [[Node (networking)|nodes]] in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79 percent of all traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2010/811381.pdf|title=Frequency of Target Crashes for IntelliDrive Safety Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents – future intersections for driverless cars (video)|date=22 March 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|publisher=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An efficient intersection management technique called Crossroads was proposed in 2017 that is robust to network delay of V2I communication and [[Worst-case execution time|Worst-case Execution time]] of the intersection manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/crossroads-time-sensitive-autonomous-intersection-management-tech|title=Crossroads: Time-Sensitive Autonomous Intersection Management Technique|date=18 June 2017|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest link and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, predicted a Helsinki think tank in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/mobility-2020/|title=Mobility 2020|date=8 January 2016|publisher=Nordic Communications Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion surveys ==
{{overly detailed|date=August 2016}}In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5146|title=Consumers in US and UK Frustrated with Intelligent Devices That Frequently Crash or Freeze, New Accenture Survey Finds|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Accenture|access-date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a "fully autonomous car". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost $3,000 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-57422698-48/many-car-buyers-show-interest-in-autonomous-car-tech/|title=Many car buyers show interest in autonomous car tech|last=Yvkoff|first=Liane|date=27 April 2012|publisher=CNET|access-date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorvision.de/service-ratgeber/selbstfahrende-autos-deutschland-22-prozent-deutschen-grosse-akzeptanz-roboterfahrzeuge-39281.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515125001/http://www.motorvision.de/service-ratgeber/selbstfahrende-autos-deutschland-22-prozent-deutschen-grosse-akzeptanz-roboterfahrzeuge-39281.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 May 2016|title=Große Akzeptanz für selbstfahrende Autos in Deutschland|date=9 October 2012|publisher=motorvision.de|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by [[Cisco Systems]] found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosphere.ca/collisionmanagement/2013/05/22/autonomous-cars-found-trustworthy-in-global-study/|title=Autonomous Cars Found Trustworthy in Global Study|date=22 May 2013|publisher=autosphere.ca|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance.com/about-us/news-and-events/2014/07/autonomous-cars-bring-em-on-drivers-say-in-insurance.com-survey.html|title=Autonomous cars: Bring 'em on, drivers say in Insurance.com survey|date=28 July 2014|website=Insurance.com|access-date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partcatalog.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-predictions/|title=Autonomous Vehicle Predictions: Auto Experts Offer Insights on the Future of Self-Driving Cars|date=16 March 2015|website=PartCatalog.com|access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyriakidis|first1=M.|last2=Happee|first2=R.|last3=De Winter|first3=J.

In 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants' age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohenberger|first1=C.|last2=Spörrle|first2=M.|last3=Welpe|first3=I.

In 2016, a [[PwC]] survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/autonomous-cars-seen-as-smarter-than-human-drivers/|title=Autonomous cars seen as smarter than human drivers|first=Kristen|last=Hall-Geisler|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 December 2016|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew Research Center survey of 4,135 U.S. adults conducted 1–15 May 2017 finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes—from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/|title=Automation in Everyday Life|last=Smith|first=Aaaron|last2=Anderson|first2=Monica |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moral issues ==
With the emergence of automated automobiles various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to an (untestable) potential for reduction of crashes by "up to" 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: Opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations.|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed. Those include, but are not limited to: the moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law; the decisions a car is to make right before a (fatal) crash; privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance; potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers; de-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users; exposure to hacking and malware; and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity, and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.

There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Responsibility for Crashes of Autonomous Vehicles: An Ethical Analysis|journal=Sci Eng Ethics|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices [who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts [who?] suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like: pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over 5 people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Trolley Problem|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=94|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it's driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Himmelreich|first=Johannes|date=2018-05-17|title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=669–684|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|issn=1386-2820}}&lt;/ref&gt;.There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Road vehicle automation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TxmfDAAAQBAJ}}|last=Meyer|first=G.|last2=Beiker|first2=S|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=93–102|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]] are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

(Many 'Trolley' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.)

Privacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual. This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/self-driving-cars-and-the-looming-privacy-apocalypse/474600/|title=How Self-Driving Cars Will Threaten Privacy|last=Lafrance|first=Adrienne|date=21 March 2016|work=|access-date=4 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jack|first=Boeglin|date=1 January 2015|title=The Costs of Self-Driving Cars: Reconciling Freedom and Privacy with Tort Liability in Autonomous Vehicle Regulation|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjolt/vol17/iss1/4|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Technology|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.

The implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-greenhouse-driverless-job-loss-20160922-snap-story.html|title=Autonomous vehicles could cost America 5 million jobs.

=== In literature ===
Intelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in [[science fiction]] literature. Examples include:
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s science-fiction short story, "[[Sally (short story)|Sally]]" (first published May–June 1953), automated cars have "[[positronic brain]]s" and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors, and save their human caretaker. Due to the high cost of the brain, few can afford a personal vehicle, so buses have become the norm.
* [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Robert A Heinlein]]'s novel, ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1980), Zeb Carter's driving and flying car "Gay Deceiver" is at first semi-automated and later, after modifications by Zeb's wife Deety, becomes sentient and capable of fully autonomous operation.
* In [[Edizioni Piemme]]'s series ''[[Geronimo Stilton]]'', a robotic vehicle called "Solar" is in the 54th book.
* [[Alastair Reynolds]]' series, ''[[Revelation Space]]'', features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]' novels ''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Freedom™]]'' (2010) driverless cars and motorcycles are used for attacks in a software-based [[open-source warfare]]. The vehicles are modified for this using [[3D printers]] and [[distributed manufacturing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t3n.de/news/3d-drucker-industrie-trend-453581/|title=3D-Drucker: Warum die Industrie wieder einen Trend verschläft|publisher=t3n News|language=de|access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are also able to operate as [[Swarm robotics|swarms]].

=== In television ===
* "[[CSI: Cyber]]" Season 2, episode 6, ''Gone in 60 Seconds'', features three seemingly normal customized vehicles, a 2009 [[Nissan Fairlady Z]] Roadster, a [[BMW M3]] E90 and a [[Cadillac CTS-V]], and one stock luxury [[BMW 7 Series]], being remote-controlled by a computer hacker.
* "[[Handicar]]", season 18, episode 4 of 2014 TV series ''[[South Park]]'' features a Japanese automated car that takes part in the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''-style car race.
* [[KITT]] and [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], the [[Pontiac Trans Am|Pontiac Firebird Trans-Am]]s in the 1982 TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', were sentient and autonomous. The KITT and KARR based [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustangs]] from [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|Knight Rider]] were also sentient and autonomous, like their Firebird counterparts.
* "Driven", series 4 episode 11 of the 2003 TV series [[NCIS (season 4)|''NCIS'']] features a robotic vehicle named "Otto", part of a high-level project of the Department of Defense, which causes the death of a Navy Lieutenant, and then later almost kills Abby.
* The TV series "[[Viper (TV series)|Viper]]" features a silver/grey armored assault vehicle, called ''The Defender'', which masquerades as a flame-red 1992 [[Dodge Viper]] RT/10 and later as a 1998 cobalt blue [[Dodge Viper GTS]]. The vehicle's sophisticated computer systems allow it to be controlled via remote on some occasions.
* "[[Black Mirror]]" episode "[[Hated in the Nation]]" briefly features a self-driving SUV with a touchscreen interface on the inside.
* ''Bull'' has a show discussing the effectiveness and safety of self-driving cars in an episode call E.J.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartermatt.com/237808/bull-episode-10-preview-self-driving-car-case-ginny-bretton/|title='Bull' episode 10 preview: The self-driving car case and Ginny Bretton|date=3 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''System of systems engineering''' ('''SoSE''') is a set of developing processes, tools, and methods for designing, re-designing and deploying solutions to [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] challenges.

== Overview ==
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains.  SoSE is more than [[systems engineering]] of monolithic, [[complexity|complex systems]] because design for System-of-Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, "Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem," 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10–13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements.

System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program.  SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for [[System of systems|System-of-Systems]] problems.

Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering.  One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

'''''The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media''''' is a book by [[José van Dijck]] published by Oxford University Press in 2013 on [[social media]] platforms and their history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-culture-of-connectivity-9780199970773?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp; The Culture of Connectivity], Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The author critically considers the histories of five social media platforms: [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Flickr]], [[YouTube]] and [[Wikipedia]]. Van Dijck's approach is based on the premise that to understand the full weight of social media, their technological dimensions should be connected to the social and the cultural.

The title of the work alludes to how the rise of social media has created a culture in which a (profitable) [[Connectivity (media)|connectivity]] is dominant.

== Synopsis==

In the book, Van Dijck critically reads the histories of five social media platforms according to an approach that brings into focus how their technological, social and cultural dimensions contribute to their current status.

==Key concepts==

;Platforms as Techno-Cultural Constructs: Van Dijck contends that any analysis of social media platforms has to originate from the level of technology. Borrowing from [[Actor–network theory]], Van Dijck approaches the three concepts of technology, users and usage and content firstly in each of her analysis chapters.

:;Technology

:;Users and Usage

:;Content

;Platforms as Socio-Economic Structures: Borrowing from the field of [[Political economy]], Van Dijck then continues with questioning ownership, governance and business model(s) of the respective platforms to come to a critical conclusion.

:;Ownership

:;Governance

A '''time crystal''' or '''space-time crystal''' is a structure that repeats in [[time]], as well as in [[space]]. Normal three-dimensional  [[crystal]]s have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. A time crystal never reaches [[thermal equilibrium]], as it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017. This state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—it is an open system in [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]].

The idea of a time crystal was first described by [[Nobel laureate]] and [[MIT]] professor [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2012. Later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals. It was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2014 Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically-driven many-body system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Norman Yao et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems. From there, [[Christopher Monroe]] and [[Mikhail Lukin]] independently confirmed this in their labs. Both experiments were published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2017.

==History==
[[File:Frank Wilczek.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel laureate]] [[Frank Wilczek]] at [[University of Paris-Saclay]]]]
The idea of a space-time crystal was first put forward by [[Frank Wilczek]], a professor at [[MIT]] and [[Nobel laureate]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2012}} and {{harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Xiang Zhang, a nanoengineer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his team proposed creating a time crystal in the form of a constantly rotating ring of charged ions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Li et al.|year1=2012a|year2=2012b}}, Wolchover 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Wilczek and Zhang, Patrick Bruno, a theorist at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in [[Grenoble]], France, published several papers in 2013 claiming to show that space-time crystals were impossible. Also later Masaki Oshikawa from the University of Tokyo showed that time crystals would be impossible at their ground state; moreover, he implied that any matter cannot exist in non-equilibrium in its ground state.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Bruno|2013a}} and {{harvp|Bruno|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Thomas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work developed more precise definitions of [[time translation symmetry]]-breaking which ultimately led to a [[No-go theorem|'no-go' proof]] that quantum time crystals in equilibrium are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Nozières|2013}}, {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017|p=1}} and {{harvp|Volovik|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several realizations of time crystals, which avoid the equilibrium no-go arguments, were later proposed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2013b}} and {{harvp|Yoshii et al.|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven system of ultracold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Khemani et al.|2016}} and {{harvp|Else et al.|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour.

Norman Yao at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] studied a different model of time crystals.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017}}, {{Harvp|Richerme|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blueprint was successfully used by two teams: a group led by [[Harvard university|Harvard]]'s [[Mikhail Lukin]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See {{harvp|Choi et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group led by [[Christopher Monroe]] at [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See {{harvp|Zhang et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time translation symmetry==
{{main article|Time translation symmetry}}
Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the [[Noether theorem]].{{sfn|Cao|2004|p=151}}

The basic idea of ''time-translation symmetry'' is that a translation in time has no effect on physical laws, i.e. that the laws of nature that apply today were the same in the past and will be the same in the future.{{sfn|Wilczek|2015|loc=chpt. 3}} This symmetry implies the [[conservation of energy]].{{sfn|Feng|Jin|2005|p=18}}

===Broken symmetry in normal crystals===
{{main article|Crystal symmetry|spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
[[Image:Phonon nu process.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2. Normal process (N-process) and Umklapp process (U-process). While the N-process conserves total [[phonon]] momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum.]] Normal crystals exhibit ''broken translation symmetry'':  they have repeated patterns in space, and are not invariant under arbitrary translations or rotations. The laws of physics are unchanged by arbitrary translations and rotations. However, if we hold fixed the atoms of a crystal, the dynamics of electrons or other particles in the crystal depends on how it moves relative to the crystal, and particles' momentum can change by interacting with the atoms of a crystal — for example in [[Umklapp process]]es.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=193}} [[Quasimomentum]], however, is conserved in a perfect crystal.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=191}}

===Broken symmetry in time crystals===
Time crystals seem to break ''time-translation symmetry,'' and have repeated patterns in time. Fields or particles may change their energy by interacting with a time crystal, just as they can change their momentum by interacting with a spatial crystal.

==Thermodynamics==
Time crystals do not violate the laws of thermodynamics: energy in the overall system is conserved, such a crystal does not spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work, and it cannot serve as a perpetual store of work.  But it may change perpetually in a fixed pattern in time for as long as the system can be maintained. They possess "motion without energy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/time-crystals-might-exist-after-all-and-they-could-break-the-symmetry-of-space-and-time|title=Time Crystals Might Exist After All - And They Could Break Space-Time Symmetry|last=Crew|first=Bec|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;—their apparent motion does not represent conventional kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|title="Time Crystals" Could Be a Legitimate Form of Perpetual Motion - Scie…|date=2017-02-02|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-09-21|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202101455/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proven that a time crystal cannot exist in thermal equilibrium.  Recent years have seen more studies of non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
In October 2016, Christopher Monroe at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] claimed to have created the world's first discrete time crystal. Using the idea from Yao's proposal, his team trapped a chain of [[Ytterbium-171|&lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ([[ytterbium]]) ions in a [[Paul trap]], confined by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. One of the two [[Spin quantum number|spin states]] was selected by a pair of laser beams. The lasers were pulsed, with the shape of the pulse controlled by an [[acousto-optic modulator]], using the [[Tukey window]] to avoid too much energy at the wrong optical frequency. The [[hyperfine]] electron states in that setup, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; |F=0, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩ and |F = 1, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩, have very close energy levels, separated by 12.642831&amp;nbsp;GHz. Ten [[Doppler cooling|Doppler-cooled]] ions were placed in a line 0.025&amp;nbsp;mm long and coupled together.

The researchers observed a subharmonic oscillation of the drive. The experiment showed "rigidity" of the time crystal, where the oscillation frequency remained unchanged even when the time crystal was perturbed, and that it gained a frequency of its own and vibrated according to it (rather than only the frequency of the drive). However, once the perturbation or frequency of vibration grew too strong, the time crystal "melted" and lost this subharmonic oscillation, and it returned to the same state as before where it moved only with the induced frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later in 2016, [[Mikhail Lukin]] at Harvard also reported the creation of a driven time crystal. His group used a [[diamond]] crystal doped with a high concentration of [[nitrogen-vacancy center]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|coherence]]. This strongly-interacting dipolar spin system was driven with microwave fields, and the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field was determine. It was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] response to the drive frequency is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[dermatopathology]], the '''Tzanck test''', also '''Tzanck smear''', is scraping of an ulcer base to look for '''Tzanck cells'''.  It is sometimes also called the '''[[chickenpox]] skin test''' and the '''[[herpes]] skin test'''.

Tzanck cells (acantholytic cells) are found in:
*[[Herpes simplex]]&lt;ref name="pmid3169755"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Folkers E, Oranje AP, Duivenvoorden JN, van der Veen JP, Rijlaarsdam JU, Emsbroek JA |title=Tzanck smear in diagnosing genital herpes |journal=Genitourinary medicine |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=249–54 |date=August 1988 |pmid=3169755 |pmc=1194227 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Varicella]] and [[herpes zoster]]
*[[Pemphigus vulgaris]]
*[[Cytomegalovirus]]

The Tzanck test has been largely replaced by [[Direct fluorescent antibody|DFA]] for identification of the herpes virus &lt;ref&gt;"The laboratory diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infections." Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2005 Mar-Apr; 16(2): 92–98. {{PMC|2095011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==

# Unroof vesicle and scrape base w/ sterile №15 scalpel blade
# Smear onto clean glass slide
# Fix w/ gentle heat or air dry
# Fix w/ MeOH (Methanol)
# Stain w/ Giemsa, methylene blue or Wright’s stain
# Microscopic examination using oil immersion lens. (Look for multinucleate giant cells)&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Normal Microbiota of the Skin, ATSU School of Osteopathic Medicine Arizona, Lecture Slides. Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified test can be performed using proprietary agents which requires fewer steps and allows the sample to be fixed quicker.

==Eponym==
It is named after [[Arnault Tzanck]] (1886–1954), a French [[dermatologist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6016">In the unconstrained [[optimization (mathematics)|minimization]] problem, the '''Wolfe conditions''' are a set of inequalities for performing '''inexact''' [[line search]], especially in [[quasi-Newton methods]], first published by Philip Wolfe in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolfe | first1 = P. | title = Convergence Conditions for Ascent Methods | doi = 10.1137/1011036 | journal = SIAM Review | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–000 | year = 1969 | jstor = 2028111| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolfe | first1 = P. | title = Convergence Conditions for Ascent Methods. II: Some Corrections | doi = 10.1137/1013035 | journal = SIAM Review | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–000 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these methods the idea is to find

::&lt;math&gt;\min_x f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[smooth function|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. Each step often involves approximately solving the subproblem

::&lt;math&gt;\min_{\alpha} f(\mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \mathbf{p}_k)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the current best guess, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k \in \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a search direction, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is the step length.

The inexact line searches provide an efficient way of computing an acceptable step length &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that reduces the [[objective function]] 'sufficiently', rather than minimizing the objective function over &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\mathbb R^+&lt;/math&gt; exactly. A line search algorithm can use Wolfe conditions as a requirement for any guessed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, before finding a new search direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Armijo rule and curvature==
A step length &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; is said to satisfy the ''Wolfe conditions'', restricted to the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt;, if the following two inequalities hold:

:i) &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k)\leq f(\mathbf{x}_k)+c_1\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt;,
:ii) &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k) \leq -c_2\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. (In examining condition (ii), recall that to ensure that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; is a descent direction, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, as in the case of [[gradient descent]], where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt;, or [[Newton-Raphson]], where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k = -\mathbf{H}^{-1} \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; positive definite.)

&lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually chosen to be quite small while &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; is much larger; Nocedal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Numerical Optimization | last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge | last2=Wright |first2=Stephen | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=epc5fX0lqRIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives example values of &lt;math&gt;c_1=10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;c_2=0.9&lt;/math&gt; for Newton or quasi-Newton methods and &lt;math&gt;c_2=0.1&lt;/math&gt; for the nonlinear [[conjugate gradient method]]. Inequality i) is known as the '''Armijo rule'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Armijo | first = Larry | year = 1966 | title = Minimization of functions having Lipschitz continuous first partial derivatives | journal = Pacific J. Math. | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–3 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102995080 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1966.16.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ii) as the '''curvature condition'''; i) ensures that the step length &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; decreases &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  'sufficiently', and ii) ensures that the slope has been reduced sufficiently.

==Strong Wolfe condition on curvature==
Denote a univariate function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; restricted to the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi(\alpha)=f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha\mathbf{p}_k)&lt;/math&gt;. The Wolfe conditions can result in a value for the step length that is not close to a minimizer of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. If we modify the curvature condition to the following,

:iii) &lt;math&gt;\big|\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k)\big|\leq c_2\big|\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\big|&lt;/math&gt;

then i) and iii) together form the so-called '''strong Wolfe conditions''', and force &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; to lie close to a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Rationale==
The principal reason for imposing the Wolfe conditions in an optimization algorithm where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \mathbf{p}_k &lt;/math&gt; is to ensure convergence of the gradient to zero.  In particular, if the cosine of the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; and the gradient,

:: &lt;math&gt; \cos \theta_k = \frac {\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^{\mathrm T}\mathbf{p}_k }{\| \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\| \|\mathbf{p}_k\| } &lt;/math&gt;

is bounded away from zero and the i) and ii) conditions hold, then &lt;math&gt; \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

An additional motivation, in the case of a [[quasi-Newton method]], is that if &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_k = -B_k^{-1} \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) &lt;/math&gt;, where the matrix &lt;math&gt; B_k &lt;/math&gt; is updated by the [[BFGS]] or [[Davidon-Fletcher-Powell formula|DFP]] formula, then if &lt;math&gt; B_k &lt;/math&gt; is positive definite ii) implies &lt;math&gt; B_{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; is also positive definite.
