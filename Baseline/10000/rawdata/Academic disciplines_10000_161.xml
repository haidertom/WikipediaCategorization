'''''Kitāb al–Milal wa al-Nihal''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:كتاب الملل والنحل, ''The Book of Sects and Creeds''), written by the [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] (d. 1153 [[Common Era|CE]]), is a non-polemical study of religious communities and philosophies that had existed up to his time, considered to be the first systematic [[religious studies|study of religion]]. It was written around 1127-1128 and divides religions between sects, which have written doctrines, and creeds which do not.

A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by [[UNESCO]] (''Livre des religions et des sects.'' Leuven, Peeters: vol. I, 1986, Vol. II, 1993).

==Overview==
Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in [[statistical shape analysis]] for its theoretical developments, as well as in [[biology]] for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various [[insect]] species (e.g., [[Dynastes|Hercules beetles]]), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns&lt;ref&gt;E.L. McCullough, K.J. Ledger, D.M. O'Brien, D.J. Emlen (2015) Variation in the allometry of exaggerated rhinoceros beetle horns. ''Animal Behaviour'' 109: 133-140. doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.08.013&lt;/ref&gt;  The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a [[power law]] equation which expresses a remarkable scale symmetry:&lt;ref name="Longo 23–73"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5_2|title=Perspectives on Organisms|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642359378|series=Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis|pages=23–73|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y = kx^a \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or in a logarithmic form:

: &lt;math&gt;\log y = a \log x + \log k\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the '''scaling exponent''' of the law.  Methods for estimating this exponent from data can use type-2 regressions, such as [[major axis regression]] or [[reduced major axis regression]], as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to [[least squares regression]], which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass).  Other methods include [[measurement error|measurement-error]] models and a particular kind of [[Power law#Power-law functions|principal component analysis]].

Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of [[ratio]]s of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size, but common shape, will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age, but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use [[lizards]] or [[snakes]] as model organisms both because they lack [[parental care]] after [[birth]] or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body sizes between the [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] and [[adult]] stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their [[ontogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]]| first=T., Jr. |author2=P. L. Else |date=March 1987 |title= Seasonal, sexual, and individual variation in endurance and activity metabolism in lizards | url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlEl87.pdf |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=252 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages= R439–49 |pmid=3826408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry.  Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also: [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]]).

Isometric scaling happens when proportional relationships are preserved as size changes during growth or over evolutionary time.  An example is found in frogs — aside from a brief period during the few weeks after metamorphosis, frogs grow isometrically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emerson SB |title=Allometry and Jumping in Frogs: Helping the Twain to Meet |journal=Evolution |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=551–564 |date=September 1978 |jstor=2407721 |doi=10.2307/2407721}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a frog whose legs are as long as its body will retain that relationship throughout its life, even if the frog itself increases in size tremendously.

Isometric scaling is governed by the [[square-cube law]].  An organism which doubles in length isometrically will find that the surface area available to it will increase fourfold, while its volume and mass will increase by a factor of eight.  This can present problems for organisms.  In the case of above, the animal now has eight times the biologically active tissue to support, but the surface area of its respiratory organs has only increased fourfold, creating a mismatch between scaling and physical demands.  Similarly, the organism in the above example now has eight times the mass to support on its legs, but the strength of its bones and muscles is dependent upon their cross-sectional area, which has only increased fourfold.  Therefore, this hypothetical organism would experience twice the bone and muscle loads of its smaller version.  This mismatch can be avoided either by being "overbuilt" when small or by changing proportions during growth, called allometry.

Isometric scaling is often used as a null hypothesis in scaling studies, with 'deviations from isometry' considered evidence of physiological factors forcing allometric growth.

==Allometric scaling==

Allometric scaling is any change that deviates from [[isometry]]. A classic example discussed by [[Galileo]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences]]'' is the skeleton of mammals. The skeletal structure becomes much stronger and more robust relative to the size of the body as the body size increases.&lt;ref name=Schmidt-Nielsen&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Nielsen|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allometry is often expressed in terms of a scaling exponent based on body mass, or body length (Snout-vent length, total length etc.). A perfectly isometrically scaling organism would see all volume-based properties change proportionally to the body mass, all surface area-based properties change with mass to the power of 2/3, and all length-based properties change with mass to the power of 1/3. If, after statistical analyses, for example, a volume-based property was found to scale to mass to the 0.9th power, then this would be called "negative allometry", as the values are smaller than predicted by isometry. Conversely, if a surface area-based property scales to mass to the 0.8th power, the values are higher than predicted by isometry and the organism is said to show "positive allometry". One example of positive allometry occurs among species of monitor lizards (family [[Varanidae]]), in which the limbs are relatively longer in larger-bodied species.&lt;ref name="Christian_and_Garland_1996"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Christian, A. |author2=Garland T., Jr. |authorlink2=Theodore Garland, Jr.  |year= 1996 |title= Scaling of limb proportions in monitor lizards (Squamata: Varanidae) |journal= Journal of Herpetology  |volume= 30 |pages= 219–230 |url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/ChriGa96.pdf |format=PDF |issue = 2 |jstor = 1565513 |doi=10.2307/1565513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for some fish, e.g. the [[muskellunge]], the weight of which grows with about the power of 3.325 of its length.&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} muskellunge will weigh about {{convert|8|lb|kg}}, while a {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} muskellunge will weigh about {{convert|18|lb|kg}}, so 33% longer length will more than double the weight.

==Determining if a system is scaling with allometry==
To determine whether isometry or allometry is present, an expected relationship between variables needs to be determined to compare data to. This is important in determining if the scaling relationship in a dataset deviates from an expected relationship (such as those that follow isometry). The use of tools such as dimensional analysis is very helpful in determining expected slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pennycuick |first=Colin J. |title= Newton Rules Biology |year=1992 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-854021-3 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Nielsen|1984|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.C. |last=Gibbings |title= Dimensional Analysis |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6iflrgVaWcC |year=2011 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-1-84996-317-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘expected’ slope, as it is known, is essential for detecting allometry because scaling variables are comparisons to other things. Saying that mass scales with a slope of 5 in relation to length doesn’t have much meaning unless knowing the isometric slope is 3, meaning in this case,  the mass is increasing extremely fast. For example, different sized frogs should be able to jump the same distance according to the geometric similarity model proposed by Hill 1950&lt;ref name="Hill_1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=A.V. |title= The dimensions of animals and their muscular dynamics |journal= Science Progress |date=April 1950 |volume=150 |bibcode= 1949Natur.164R.820. |page=820 |doi= 10.1038/164820b0 |issue=4176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted by Wilson 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson RS, Franklin CE, James RS |title= Allometric scaling relationships of jumping performance in the striped marsh frog ''Limnodynastes peronii'' |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=203 |issue=Pt 12 |pages= 1937–46 |date= June 2000 |pmid=10821750 |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10821750}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in actuality larger frogs do jump longer distances. 
[[Dimensional analysis]] is extremely useful for balancing units in an equation or in this case, determining expected slope.

A few dimensional examples follow (M=Mass, L=Length, V=Volume, which is also L cubed because a volume is merely length cubed):
[[File:Scalingfigure.jpg|thumb|Allometric relations show as straight lines when plotted on [[Logarithmic scale|double-logarithmic]] axes]]
To find the expected slope for the relationship between mass and the characteristic length of an animal (see figure), the units of mass (M=L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, because mass is a volume; volumes are lengths cubed) from the Y-axis are divided by the units of the X-axis (in this case, L). The expected slope on a double-logarithmic plot of L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in this case is 3 (log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)=3). This is the slope of a straight line, but most data gathered in science do not fall neatly in a straight line, so data transformations are useful. 
It is also important to keep in mind what is being compared in the data. Comparing a characteristic such as head length to head width might yield different results from comparing head length to body length. That is, different characteristics may scale differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Robinson |first=Michael |first2=Philip |last2=Motta |title= Patterns of growth and the effects of scale on the feeding kinematics of the nurse shark (''Ginglymostoma cirratum'') |journal= Journal of Zoology, London |year=2002 |volume=256 |pages=449–462 |doi= 10.1017/S0952836902000493 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common way to analyze data such as those collected in scaling is to use [[Log-log plot|log-transformation]]. There are two reasons for log transformation - a biological reason and a statistical reason. Biologically, log-log transformation places numbers into a geometric domain so that proportional deviations are represented consistently, independent of the scale and units of measurement. In biology this is appropriate  because many biological phenomena (e.g. growth, reproduction, metabolism, sensation) are fundamentally multiplicative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kerkhoff, A.J. |author2=Enquist, B.J. |title=Multiplicative by nature: Why logarithmic transformation is necessary in allometry |journal= Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=257 |pages=519–521 |year= 2009 |doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.12.026 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistically, it is beneficial to transform both axes using logarithms and then perform a linear regression. This will normalize the data set and make it easier to analyze trends using the slope of the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O’Hara, R.B. |author2=Kotze, D.J. |title=Do not log-transform count data |journal= Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=1 |pages=118–122 |year= 2010 |doi= 10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00021.x |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before analyzing data though, it is important to have a predicted slope of the line to compare the analysis to.

After data are log-transformed and linearly regressed, comparisons can then use [[least squares regression]] with 95% confidence intervals or [http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/RMA.html reduced major axis analysis]. Sometimes the two analyses can yield different results, but often they do not. If the expected slope is outside the confidence intervals, then there is allometry present. If mass in this imaginary animal scaled with a slope of 5 and this was a statistically significant value, then mass would scale very fast in this animal versus the expected value. It would scale with positive allometry. If the expected slope were 3 and in reality in a certain organism mass scaled with 1 (assuming this slope is statistically significant), then it would be negatively allometric.

Another example: Force is dependent on the cross-sectional area of muscle (CSA), which is L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If comparing force to a length, then the expected slope is 2. 
Alternatively, this analysis may be accomplished with a power regression. Plot the relationship between the data onto a graph. Fit this to a power curve (depending on the stats program, this can be done multiple ways), and it will give an equation with the form: ''y''=''Zx''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the number. That “number” is the relationship between the data points. The downside, to this form of analysis, is that it makes it a little more difficult to do statistical analyses.

==Physiological scaling==

Many physiological and biochemical processes (such as heart rate, respiration rate or the maximum reproduction rate) show scaling, mostly associated with the ratio between surface area and mass (or volume) of the animal.&lt;ref name="Longo 23–73"/&gt; The [[metabolic rate]] of an individual animal is also subject to scaling.

===Metabolic rate and body mass===
In plotting an animal's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) against the animal's own body mass, a logarithmic straight line is obtained, indicating a [[power law|power-law]] dependence.  Overall metabolic rate in animals is generally accepted to show negative allometry, scaling to mass to a power of ≈&amp;nbsp;0.75, known as [[Kleiber's law]], 1932.  This means that larger-bodied species (e.g., elephants) have lower mass-specific metabolic rates and lower heart rates, as compared with smaller-bodied species (e.g., mice). The straight line generated from a double logarithmic scale of metabolic rate in relation to body mass is known as the "mouse-to-elephant curve".&lt;ref name="Willmer_2009" /&gt;  These relationships of metabolic rates, times, and internal structure have been explained as, "an elephant is approximately a blown-up gorilla, which is itself a blown-up mouse."&lt;ref name=bettencourt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bettencourt LM, Lobo J, Helbing D, Kühnert C, West GB |title=Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities |journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 |issue=17 |pages=7301–6 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17438298 |pmc=1852329 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610172104 |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/104/17/7301.long|bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.7301B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Kleiber contributed the following allometric equation for relating the BMR to the body mass of an animal.&lt;ref name="Willmer_2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willmer|first=Pat|title=Environmental Physiology of Animals|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis of the intercept did not vary from 70 and the slope was not varied from 0.75, thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Metabolic rate} = 70 M^{0.75}&lt;/math&gt; (although the universality of this relation has been disputed both empirically and theoretically &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodds PS, Rothman DH, Weitz JS |title=Re-examination of the "3/4-law" of metabolism |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=209 |issue=1 |date=March 2001| pages=9–27 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0007096 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2238|arxiv=physics/0007096 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman DH, Weitz JS |title=Beyond the ‘3/4-power law’: variation in the intra- and interspecific scaling of metabolic rate in animals |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=Nov 2005| pages=611–662  |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S1464793105006834/full |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006834}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)
where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is body mass, and metabolic rate is measured in [[Calorie|kcal]] per day.

Consequently, the body mass itself can explain the majority of the variation in the BMR. After the body mass effect, the taxonomy of the animal plays the next most significant role in the scaling of the BMR. The further speculation that environmental conditions play a role in BMR can only be properly investigated once the role of taxonomy is established. The challenge with this lies in the fact that a shared environment also indicates a common evolutionary history and thus a close taxonomic relationship. There are strides currently in research to overcome these hurdles; for example, an analysis in muroid rodents,&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt; the mouse, hamster, and vole type, took into account taxonomy. Results revealed the hamster (warm dry habitat) had lowest BMR and the mouse (warm wet dense habitat) had the highest BMR. Larger organs could explain the high BMR groups, along with their higher daily energy needs. Analyses such as these demonstrate the physiological adaptations to environmental changes that animals undergo.

Energy metabolism is subjected to the scaling of an animal and can be overcome by an individual's body design. The metabolic scope for an animal is the ratio of resting and maximum rate of metabolism for that particular species as determined by oxygen consumption.
Oxygen consumption V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and maximum oxygen consumption [[VO2 max]]. Oxygen consumption in species that differ in body size and organ system dimensions show a similarity in their charted V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; distributions indicating that, despite the complexity of their systems, there is a power law dependence of similarity; therefore, universal patterns are observed in diverse animal taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Labra FA, Marquet PA, Bozinovic F |title=Scaling metabolic rate fluctuations |journal=Proc.

Across a broad range of species, allometric relations are not necessarily linear on a log-log scale.  For example, the maximal running speeds of mammals show a complicated relationship with body mass, and the fastest sprinters are of intermediate body size.&lt;ref name='Garland_1983_JZL'&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] Jr.|first=T. |year=1983 |title=The relation between maximal running speed and body mass in terrestrial mammals| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf |journal=Journal of Zoology, London |volume=199 |issue= 2|pages=157–170 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02087.x |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chappell_1989'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chappell|first=R. |year=1989 |title=Fitting bent lines to data, with applications to allometry |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=138 |issue= 2|pages=235–256 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80141-9|pmid=2607772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allometric muscle characteristics===
The [[muscle]] characteristics of animals are similar in a wide range of animal sizes, though muscle sizes and shapes can and often do vary depending on environmental constraints placed on them. The muscle tissue itself maintains its contractile characteristics and does not vary depending on the size of the animal. Physiological scaling in muscles affects the number of muscle fibers and their intrinsic speed to determine the maximum power and efficiency of movement in a given animal. The speed of muscle recruitment varies roughly in inverse proportion to the cube root of the animal’s weight (compare the intrinsic [[frequency]] of the sparrow’s flight muscle to that of a stork).
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{frequency} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{mass}^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

For inter-species allometric relations related to such ecological variables as maximal reproduction rate, attempts have been made to explain scaling within the context of [[dynamic energy budget]] theory and the [[metabolic theory of ecology]]. However, such ideas have been less successful.

===Allometry of legged locomotion===

====Methods of study====
Allometry has been used to study patterns in locomotive principles across a broad range of species.&lt;ref name="Daley2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Two explanations for the compliant running paradox: reduced work of bouncing viscera and increased stability in uneven terrain | journal=Biology Letters | volume=6 | pages=418–421 | year=2010 | first1=Monica A. | last1=Daley | first2=James R. | last2=Usherwood | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0175 | issue=3 | pmid=20335198 | pmc=2880072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farley1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farley CT, Glasheen J, McMahon TA |title=Running springs: speed and animal size |journal=J.

Allometric study of locomotion involves the analysis of the relative sizes, masses, and limb structures of similarly shaped animals and how these features affect their movements at different speeds.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;  Patterns are identified based on dimensionless [[Froude number]]s, which incorporate measures of animals’ leg lengths, speed or stride frequency, and weight.&lt;ref name="Sellers2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;

Alexander incorporates Froude-number analysis into his “dynamic similarity hypothesis” of gait patterns. Dynamically  similar gaits are those between which there are constant coefficients that can relate linear dimensions, time intervals, and forces. In other words, given a mathematical description of gait A and these three coefficients, one could produce gait B, and vice versa. The hypothesis itself is as follows: “animals of different sizes tend to move in dynamically similar fashion whenever the ratio of their speed allows it.” While the dynamic similarity hypothesis may not be a truly unifying principle of animal gait patterns, it is a remarkably accurate heuristic.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;

It has also been shown that living organisms of all shapes and sizes utilize spring mechanisms in their locomotive systems, probably in order to minimize the energy cost of locomotion.&lt;ref name="Roberts2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Fleximble mechanisms: the diverse roles of biological springs in vertebrate movement | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=214 | pages=353–361 | year=2011 | first1=Thomas J. | last1=Roberts | first2=Emanuel | last2=Azizi | doi=10.1242/jeb.038588 | issue=3 | pmid=21228194 | pmc=3020146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allometric study of these systems has fostered a better understanding of why spring mechanisms are so common,&lt;ref name="Roberts2011" /&gt; how limb compliance varies with body size and speed,&lt;ref name="Daley2010" /&gt; and how these mechanisms affect general limb kinematics and dynamics.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;

====Principles of legged locomotion identified through allometry====
* Alexander found that animals of different sizes and masses traveling with the same [[Froude number]] consistently exhibit similar gait patterns.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* Duty factors—percentages of a stride during which a foot maintains contact with the ground—remain relatively constant for different animals moving with the same Froude number.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* The dynamic similarity hypothesis states that "animals of different sizes tend to move in dynamically similar fashion whenever the ratio of their speed allows it".&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* Body mass has even more of an effect than speed on limb dynamics.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* Leg stiffness, &lt;math&gt;k_\text{leg} =\frac{\text{peak force}}{\text{peak displacement}}&lt;/math&gt;, is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.67}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is body mass.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* Peak force experienced throughout a stride is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.97}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The amount by which a leg shortens during a stride (i.e. its peak displacement) is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.30}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The angle swept by a leg during a stride is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{-0.034}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The mass-specific work rate of a limb is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.11}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;

===Drug dose scaling===
The physiological effect of drugs and other substances in many cases scales allometrically.

West, Brown, and Enquist in 1997 derived a hydrodynamic theory to explain the universal fact that metabolic rate scales as the ¾ power with body weight. They also showed why lifespan scales as the +¼ power and heart rate as the -¼ power.  Blood flow (+¾)  and resistance (-¾) scale in the same way, leading to blood pressure being constant across species.&lt;ref name="Westetal1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=G.

Hu and Hayton in 2001 discussed whether the basal metabolic rate scale is a ⅔ or ¾ power of body mass. The exponent of ¾ might be used for substances that are eliminated mainly by metabolism, or by metabolism and excretion combined, while ⅔ might apply for drugs that are eliminated mainly by renal excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Allometric scaling in fluid locomotion==
''This technical section is not well-written and needs editing''.

The mass and density of an organism have a large effect on the organism's locomotion through a fluid. For example, a tiny organisms uses flagella and can effectively move through a fluid it is suspended in.  Then on the other scale a blue whale that is much more massive and dense in comparison with the viscosity of the fluid, compared to a bacterium in the same medium. The way in which the fluid interacts with the external boundaries of the organism is important with locomotion through the fluid. For streamlined swimmers the resistance or drag determines the performance of the organism.  This drag or resistance can be seen in two distinct flow patterns.  There is Laminar Flow where the fluid is relatively uninterrupted after the organism moves through it.  Turbulent flow is the opposite, where the fluid moves roughly around an organisms that creates vortices that absorb energy from the propulsion or momentum of the organism.  Scaling also affects locomotion through a fluid because of the energy needed to propel an organism and to keep up velocity through momentum.  The rate of oxygen consumption per gram body size decreases consistently with increasing body size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt; (Knut Schmidt-Nielson 2004)

In general, smaller, more streamlined organisms create laminar flow (''R''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.5x106), whereas larger, less streamlined organisms produce turbulent flow (''R''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.0×106).&lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt;  Also, increase in velocity (V) increases turbulence, which can be proved using the Reynolds equation.  In nature however, organisms such as a 6‘-6” dolphin moving at 15 knots does not have the appropriate Reynolds numbers for laminar flow ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;107, but exhibit it in nature.  Mr. G.A Steven observed and documented dolphins moving at 15 knots alongside his ship leaving a single trail of light when phosphorescent activity in the sea was high. The factors that contribute are:
* Surface area of the organism and its effect on the fluid in which the organism lives is very important in determining the parameters of locomotion.
* The Velocity of an organism through fluid changes the dynamic of the flow around that organism and as velocity increases the shape of the organism becomes more important for laminar flow.
* Density and viscosity of fluid.
* Length of the organism is factored into the equation because the surface area of just the front 2/3 of the organism has an effect on the drag

'''The resistance to the motion of an approximately stream-lined solid through a fluid can be expressed by the formula: &lt;big&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''fρ''&lt;/sub&gt;(total surface)''V''2/2&lt;/big&gt; &lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'''V = velocity
: ''ρ'' = density of fluid
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;  = 1.33''R'' − 1 (laminar flow) ''R'' = Reynolds number

: Reynolds number &lt;big&gt;[''R''] = ''VL''/''ν''&lt;/big&gt;
: ''V'' = velocity
: ''L'' = axial length of organism
: ''ν'' = kinematic viscosity (viscosity/density)
	
Notable Reynolds numbers:
: ''R'' &lt; 0.5x106 = laminar flow threshold
: ''R'' &gt; 2.0x106 = turbulent flow threshold

Scaling also has an effect on the performance of organisms in fluid.  This is extremely important for marine mammals and other marine organisms that rely on atmospheric oxygen to survive and carry out respiration.  This can affect how fast an organism can propel itself efficiently and more importantly how long it can dive, or how long and how deep an organism can stay underwater.  Heart mass and lung volume are important in determining how scaling can affect metabolic function and efficiency.  Aquatic mammals, like other mammals, have the same size heart proportional to their bodies.

Mammals have a heart that is about 0.6% of the total body mass across the board from a small mouse to a large Blue Whale.  It can be expressed as: Heart Weight = 0.006Mb1.0, where Mb is the body mass of the individual.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt;  Lung volume is also directly related to body mass in mammals (slope = 1.02).   The lung has a volume of 63 ml for every kg of body mass.  In addition, the tidal volume at rest in an individual is 1/10 the lung volume.   Also respiration costs with respect to oxygen consumption is scaled in the order of Mb.75.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt;  This shows that mammals, regardless of size, have the same size respiratory and cardiovascular systems and it turn have the same amount of blood:  About 5.5% of body mass.  This means that for a similarly designed marine mammals, the larger the individual the more efficiently they can travel compared to a smaller individual.  It takes the same effort to move one body length whether the individual is one meter or ten meters. This can explain why large whales can migrate far distance in the oceans and not stop for rest. It is metabolically less expensive to be larger in body size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt; This goes for terrestrial and flying animals as well. In fact, for an organism to move any distance, regardless of type from elephants to centipedes, smaller animals consume more oxygen per unit body mass than larger ones. This metabolic advantage that larger animals have makes it possible for larger marine mammals to dive for longer durations of time than their smaller counterparts. That the heart rate is lower means that larger animals can carry more blood, which carries more oxygen.  Then in conjuncture with the fact that mammals reparation costs scales in the order of Mb.75 shows how an advantage can be had in having a larger body mass.  More simply, a larger whale can hold more oxygen and at the same time demand less metabolically than a smaller whale.

Traveling long distances and deep dives are a combination of good stamina and also moving an efficient speed and in an efficient way to create laminar flow, reducing drag and turbulence.  In sea water as the fluid, it traveling long distances in large mammals, such as whales, is facilitated by their neutral buoyancy and have their mass completely supported by the density of the sea water. On land, animals have to expend a portion of their energy during locomotion to fight the effects of gravity.

Flying organisms such as birds are also considered moving through a fluid. In scaling birds of similar shape, it has also been seen that larger individuals have less metabolic cost per kg than smaller species, which would be expected because it holds true for every other form of animal.  Birds also have a variance in wing beat frequency.  Even with the compensation of larger wings per unit body mass, larger birds also have a slower wing beat frequency, which allows larger birds to fly at higher altitudes, longer distances, and faster absolute speeds than smaller birds.  Because of the dynamics of lift-based locomotion and the fluid dynamics, birds have a U-shaped curve for metabolic cost and velocity.  Because flight, in air as the fluid, is metabolically more costly at the lowest and the highest velocities.  On the other end, small organisms such as insects can make gain advantage from the viscosity of the fluid (air) that they are moving in.  A wing-beat timed perfectly can effectively uptake energy from the previous stroke. (Dickinson 2000) This form of wake capture allows an organism to recycle energy from the fluid or vortices within that fluid created by the organism itself.  This same sort of wake capture occurs in aquatic organisms as well, and for organisms of all sizes. This dynamic of fluid locomotion allows smaller organisms to gain advantage because the effect on them from the fluid is much greater because of their relatively smaller size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"&gt;{{cite book |first=Knut |last=Schmidt-Nielsen |title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC |date=10 April 1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57098-5 |edition=5th |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allometric engineering==
[[Allometric engineering]] is a method for manipulating allometric relationships within or among groups.&lt;ref name=sinervo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sinervo, B. |author2=Huey, R. |year=1990|title=Allometric Engineering: An Experimental Test of the Causes of Interpopulational Differences in Performance|pages=1106–9|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=248|doi=10.1126/science.248.4959.1106|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/pdfs/SinervoScience1.pdf|issue=4959 |format=PDF|bibcode = 1990Sci...248.1106S |pmid=17733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In characteristics of a city==
Arguing that there are a number of analogous concepts and mechanisms between cities and biological entities, Bettencourt et al. showed a number of scaling relationships between observable properties of a city and the city size. GDP, "supercreative" employment, number of inventors, crime, spread of disease,&lt;ref name=bettencourt/&gt; and even pedestrian walking speeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bornstein MH, Bornstein HG |title=The Pace of Life |journal=Nature  |volume=259 |issue=5544 |pages=557–9 |date=19 February 1976 |doi=10.1038/259557a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v259/n5544/abs/259557a0.html|bibcode = 1976Natur.259..557B }}&lt;/ref&gt; scale with city population.

==Examples==
Some examples of allometric laws:
* [[Kleiber's law]], metabolic rate &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the &lt;math&gt;3/4&lt;/math&gt; power:
:: &lt;math&gt;q_{0} \sim M^{\frac 3 4}&lt;/math&gt;
* breathing and heart rate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are both inversely proportional to body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt; power:
:: &lt;math&gt;t \sim M^{-\frac{1}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
* mass transfer contact area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt;A \sim M^{\frac 7 8}&lt;/math&gt;
* the proportionality between the optimal [[cruising speed]] &lt;math&gt;V_{opt}&lt;/math&gt; of flying bodies (insects, birds, airplanes) and body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power &lt;math&gt;1/6&lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{opt} \sim  M^{\frac 1 6}&lt;/math&gt;

==Determinants of size in different species==
Many factors go into the determination of body mass and size for a given animal. These factors often affect body size on an evolutionary scale, but conditions such as availability of food and [[habitat]] size can act much more quickly on a species. Other examples include the following:

*Physiological design
: Basic physiological design plays a role in the size of a given species. For example, animals with a closed circulatory system are larger than animals with open or no circulatory systems.&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt;
*Mechanical design
: Mechanical design can also determine the maximum allowable size for a species. Animals with tubular endoskeletons tend to be larger than animals with exoskeletons or hydrostatic skeletons.&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt;
*Habitat
: An animal’s habitat throughout its [[evolution]] is one of the largest determining factors in its size. On land, there is a positive correlation between body mass of the top species in the area and available land area.&lt;ref name="Burness_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burness|first1=G. P.|last2=Diamond|first2=Jared|last3=Flannery|first3=Timothy|title=Dinosaurs, dragons, and dwarfs: The evolution of maximal body size|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |year=2001 |volume=98 |issue=25|pages=14518–23|doi=10.1073/pnas.251548698 |pmid=11724953 |pmc=64714|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9814518B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a much greater number of “small” species in any given area. This is most likely determined by ecological conditions, evolutionary factors, and the availability of food; a small population of large predators depend on a much greater population of small prey to survive. In an aquatic environment, the largest animals can grow to have a much greater body mass than land animals where gravitational weight constraints are a factor.&lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Alternative technology''' is a term used to refer to technologies that are more [[environmentally friendly]] than the functionally equivalent technologies dominant in current practice.

The term was coined by [[Peter Harper (alternative technologist)|Peter Harper]], one of the founders of the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]], [[North Wales]] (a.k.a. ''The Quarry''), in [[Undercurrents (magazine)]] in the 1970s.

Some "alternative technologies" have in the past or may in the future become widely adopted, after which they might no longer be considered "alternative."  For example, the use of wind turbines to produce electricity.

==Alternative technologies==
Alternative technologies include the following:
* [[Anaerobic digestion]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Fuel cell]]s 
* Fuels for automobiles (besides [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]])
** [[Alcohol fuel|Alcohol]] (either [[ethanol]] or [[methanol]])
** [[Biodiesel]]
** [[Vegetable oil]]
** [[Biomass to liquid]]
* [[Greywater]]
* [[Photovoltaic module|Solar panel]]s
** Silicon-based
** [[Photosynthetic]] "[[Gratzel cell]]s" ([[Titanium dioxide]])
* [[Landfill gas]] extraction from landfills
* [[Mechanical biological treatment]]
* [[Recycling]]

'''Antonio Cornazzano''' (c. 1430 in [[Piacenza]] – 1484&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Dance|last = Kassig|first = Gayle|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2007|isbn =9780736060356|location = Champaign, IL|pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ferrara]]) was an Italian poet, writer, biographer, and [[Choreography|dancing master]].

In the city of Piacenza, which was then in the Duchy of [[Milan]], Antonio Cornazzano was born probably in 1432. His father, Bonifacio Cornazzano was a well-known lawyer and his mother, Costanza Bagarotti, belonged to the small nobility from Piacentine territory. Cornazzano studied at the university of [[Siena]] between 1444–47, and in 1450 he was in Rome, probably in the service of a high prelate. He then found his way to Milan in 1455, where he served Duke [[Francesco Sforza]], and wrote a long poem in praise of the Duke, his 'De gestis Francisci Sfortiae' or 'Sforziade'. He also wrote a small treatise on the art of dancing, a life of the Virgin Mary and a Latin scurrilous collection of 'novellae' "De proverbiorum origine". After attending the Duke's funeral in 1466, he left Milan. He moved to Venetian territory and, for a time, worked with the condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, whose biography Cornazzano wrote in Latin. In Venice, he worked with the printer Nicolas Jenson, and published a "Life of Christ". In 1475, he moved to the court of Ferrara, where he wrote important works; a short treatise on government, and one on military art (c. 1476) in prose. He later turned the latter into a terza rima poem. He died in Ferrara in 1484.

==Cornazzano's Poetic Life==
There is a manuscript in the Estense Library in Modena, Italy, written in 15th or 16th century script. It contains four poetic Italian works by Corazzano in ''terza rima''- a form of stanza that requires a set of three lines that rhyme. ''Terza rima'' was first used by Italian Dante Alighieri. Of the four works, three were published, along with a number of his poems in the same style. The title of ''Opera nova'' were given to these selections published in 1517 and 1518. Of Cornazzano's four works mentioned above, one, the first of the series,''De mulieribus admirandis'', was never published (but see C. FAHY, "The 'De mulieribus admirandis' of Antonio Cornazzano" in LA BIBLIOFILIA, 52 (1960) pp.&amp;nbsp;144–174). It, in fact, has grown in obscurity over the many years since its creation until it has nearly been wiped from history's rich pages. It has even received little, if any attention from the scholarly men of Italy.
(The above is rather sketchy) for accurate, reliable and scholarly information,

See: R.L. BRUNI and D. ZANCANI, Antonio Cornazzano: La tradizione testuale, Florence, Olschki 1992.

There is another article in English on Cornazzano, apart from Fahy's, by D. ZANCANI, 'Antonio Cornazzano's "De l'integrita' de la militare arte"', in "Chivalry in the Renaissance, ed. by S. Anglo, Woodbridge, Boydell 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–24.

==Cornazzano's Life Of Dancing==
Cornazzano's dancing master was [[Domenico da Piacenza]], who was perhaps better known as Domenico da Ferrara. Cornazzano was a fellow student with Guglielmo Ebreo. He once said this concerning his dancing master, he is the ''king of the art''. Cornazzano published his Libro dell'arte del danzare in 1455 a treatise on dancing in the 15th century.

The [[Indiana University]] '''Archives of Traditional Music''' holds over 100,000 audio and video individual recordings across over 3500 collections of field, broadcast, and commercial recordings. Its holdings are primarily focused on audiovisual recordings relating to research in the academic disciplines of [[ethnomusicology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and various area studies.

==History==
The archive was initiated by [[George Herzog]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.  It was modeled on the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]], where Herzog had worked as an assistant to [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich M. von Hornbostel]] from 1921–1924. Herzog brought the nascent archive to [[Indiana University]] in 1948 when he was appointed as professor in the Department of Anthropology. The archive was formally established at Indiana University in 1954 under its second director, [[George List]], as the Archives of Folk and Primitive Music.  Its present name, the Archives of Traditional Music, was adopted in 1964 when it became a division of the Folklore Institute.&lt;ref name="ATM Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|date=1970|publisher=Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|location=Bloomington, IN|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Following insights gained through the Sound Directions Project about a looming crisis in time-based media preservation, staff at the ATM pursued a collaborative strategy for saving its media holdings. In 2008, they participated in a small coalition of archivists and librarians at Indiana University that began a survey of the audio-visual materials held on the Bloomington Campus. The survey was prompted by the recognition that the university held a large amount of time-based media in danger of deterioration and playback obsolescence. This survey revealed that the Bloomington campus held more than a half-million audiovisual recordings across eighty units and that large portions of the University's holdings were at risk for loss. Following the publication of a survey report in 2009, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research funded a preservation planning document under the aegis of what was known as the Media Preservation Initiative (MPI).&lt;ref name="Media Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/media-preservation-initiative.html|title=MPI|publisher=Indiana University Archive of Traditional Music|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendations of the planning document, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie announced a 15 million dollar commitment to the preservation of audio and video recordings on the Bloomington campus.  The resulting endeavor was renamed the Media Preservation and Digitization Initiative (MDPI) which formed a partnership with Memnon Archiving Services to digitally preserve 280,000 audio and video recordings by 2020.&lt;ref name="Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mdpi.iu.edu/index.php |title=MDPI|publisher=Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 12,000 films from Indiana University's Moving Image Archives and other campus collections, including the Archives of Traditional Music were added to the efforts of MDPI. As the largest holder of unique and rare audiovisual recordings at Indiana University, nearly all of the archives' 100,000 recordings will be digitized by 2020 through this initiative. MDPI was the first – and as of 2018 the only – university-based media preservation effort in the United States on this scale.

==Projects==

===Archive of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories===
The AHEYM Project has collected nearly 400 interviews related to Jewish life before, during, and after World War II. Conducted primarily in Yiddish, the interviewees come from small towns throughout Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. The current online exhibit cover daily life, foodways, Jewish life between the wars, religion, World War II and the Holocaust, and Jewish life after World War II. The archive can be explored by location, person, or subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~aheym/index.php|title=AHEYM - The Archives of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories - Home - Indiana University|website=www.iub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation and cataloging of AHEYM Project recordings was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

===Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive===
The EVIA Digital Archive is a project created to host a digital archive of ethnographic videos for educational use. The projected originated from a collaboration between Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eviada.webhost.iu.edu/Scripts/default.cfm|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|publisher=Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology Multimedia===
EM publishes books and supplemental audiovisual material on [[Ethnomusicology]] in order to aid scholars in research. EM offers access to Annotation Management System (AMS), which allows authors to upload audiovisual material and link it to content in their text. EM is a joint project between Indiana   and Temple Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethnomultimedia.org/about.html|title=About Ethnomusicology Online|website=ethnomultimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoagy Carmichael Online===
The [[Hoagy Carmichael]] Project at [[Indiana University]] was a project funded by IMLS between 1999 and 2000 to digitize and preserve the extensive collection of items related to Hoagy Carmichael that are housed at Indiana University. This early digital collection website aimed to present in its entirety the complete Carmichael collection. The collection contains sound recordings, letters, photographs, lyric sheets, correspondence, as well as personal effects.  It offers a biography and a virtual tour of the Carmichael Room located at the Archives of Traditional Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/hoagy/intro/collec_over/|title=Overview of the Hoagy Carmichael Collection|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arts integration''' is an approach to teaching that integrates the fine and performing arts as primary pathways to learning. Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as "an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives."

==History of arts education and arts integration==
Arts integration is related to [[Arts in education|arts education]] in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of [[John Dewey]]'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's ''The Integrated School Art Program (1939).'' For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.

According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,'' Enlightened Cherishing''. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of [[cognition]]. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity—the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bresler | first1 = Liora | year = | title = The Subservient, Co-Equal, Affective, and Social Integration Styles and their Implications for.. | url = | journal = Arts Education Policy Review | volume = 96 | issue = 5| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bolyard Cassandra. (1973). Creativity: An Integral Part of the Secondary School Curriculum.Education.Nov.-Dec.190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with [[locus of control]] identification counseling experiences to help higher education students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen.Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance.6. (4). January, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include it as one of the Core Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html The Importance of Arts Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002052454/http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Please see Renaissance in the Classroom's sub-chapter entitled "The Arts in American Public Education: A Brief History" for a more comprehensive reading with additional references&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. 

==Arts integration research and advocacy==
Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches "21st-century skills" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education. Tension between the utilitarian, workplace-focused view and the educational, growth-centered framework on advocacy continues to shape and reshape the arts education universe as revisions to the&amp;nbsp;[http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/ National Core Arts Standards]&amp;nbsp;reflect fluctuations in advocacy rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Leann F.|date=2013|title=Questioning the Role of "21st-Century Skills" in Arts Education Advocacy Discourse|jstor=43288769|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.2307/43288769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for the arts integration is a growing body of research that demonstrates how learners experience success when taught why and how to use music, visual art, drama/dance, theatre and the literary arts to both express and understand ideas, thoughts and feelings. Critical Links,&lt;ref&gt;Deasy, Richard, et al. Critical Links : Learning in the Arts and Student Academic and Social Development. Washington, DC: Arts Education Partnership, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium published by the Arts Education Partnership ([http://www.aep-arts.org/e.com AEP]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), includes 62 studies which examine the relationship between arts learning, academic achievement, and social development of students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks Arts Education Partnership : : Publication Toolkits : : Critical Links] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826130015/http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks |date=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include studies which explore the use of drama to increase students' reading comprehension and studies which examine the relationship between music and math concepts. The Arts Education Partnership has also published The Third Space,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, L. M., R. Deasy, and A. E. Partnership. Third Space: When Learning Matters. Arts Education Partnership, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; which profiles ten arts-integrated schools across the [[United States]].

Another American organization conducting research in arts integration is the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeweb.org/ |title=CAPE &amp;#124; Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education |publisher=Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has published, through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Renaissance in the Classroom: Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning.&lt;ref&gt;Renaissance in the Classroom : Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning. Mahwah, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The book, edited by Gail Burnaford, Ph.D, former professor at [[Northwestern University]] and current professor at Florida Atlantic University; Cynthia Weiss, teaching artist and former CAPE associate (2000 to 2002); and Arnold Aprill, CAPE's Founding &amp; Creative Director, combines the contributions of two-hundred seventy-two participants in CAPE's arts integration partnerships. James Catterall, arts education researcher and professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has collaborated with CAPE on publications.

[[Harvard University]]'s Graduate School of Education supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120148/http://www.pzweb.harvard.edu/ Project Zero], an educational research group founded in 1967 by Nelson Goodman, which investigates learning in the arts. Former directors of Project Zero include David Perkins and [[Howard Gardner]]. Currently, it is directed by Steve Seidel, and has expanded its research in arts learning to include other branches of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm History of Project Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210538/http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] has been used as part of the rationale for the use of integrated arts models in teaching and learning.

For over 30 years, [http://www.kennedy-center.org the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts] in Washington, D.C., has been offering arts integration learning opportunities for educators.  Locally, through its [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/ Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)] program, the Kennedy Center provides professional learning for Washington, D.C. area educators that are implementing arts integration in their classrooms or teaching about an art form.  To develop a school-wide culture of arts integration, a network of CETA schools partner with the Kennedy Center to engage their teachers in in-depth professional learning focused on arts integration.  The CETA program has added to the research about the impact of arts integration on students, teachers, and school culture through multiple evaluation studies.  To reach educators throughout the nation, the Kennedy Center hosts an annual Arts Integration Conference, in which educators actively explore arts integration concepts and strategies.  The Kennedy Center’s online resource, [http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators.aspx ARTSEDGE], also hosts a web series of arts integration resources that explain the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of arts integration, provides examples of arts integration in practice, and links to a range of resources.  A series of Kennedy Center Seminars for Teaching Artists that focus on arts integration, as well as practices for developing strong arts-integrated residencies for students and workshops for teachers are available throughout the nation. A National Seminar for Teaching Artists is offered bi-annually at the Kennedy Center during the summer. 
Three other Kennedy Center national initiatives support practices and partnerships in arts integration and arts education: [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/anygivenchild/ Any Given Child], [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/ Partners in Education], and [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ VSA].

[[The Kennedy Center]] Partners in Education, headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], is an organization that has promoted arts integration for over two decades. While The Kennedy Center does conduct research in arts learning, they also provide networking opportunities for arts education programs nationwide through The Kennedy Center Alliance for Arts Education Network [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN]. This organization advocates for arts education, fosters collaboration between artists and schools to support arts learning, develops and conducts professional development in arts education for teachers, and recognizes achievement in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, [[Lesley University]] in Cambridge,  MA, has been educating classroom teachers across the US in the implementation of arts integration through a [http://www.lesley.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum-instruction-integrated-teaching-through-the-arts-professional-teacher professional development master's degree program].

ArtsNow [http://www.artsnowlearning.org] provides professional development training for educators, focused on building the skills needed to integrate arts across the curriculum. Through the innovative Foundational Training course, teachers learn to identify opportunities to integrate all art forms - visual, dance, and music - into lessons in all class subjects for grades K-12, meeting both state and national curriculum standards (including Common Core standards). ArtsNow offers free Ignite Curriculum Guides through its website.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsNow Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

EducationCloset [http://educationcloset.com] provides professional development in arts integration and innovation in teaching.  With an annual Arts Integration conference, [https://educationcloset.com/integrated-curriculum/ Arts Integrated Curriculum], courses, webinars and publications available, teachers, artists, arts educators, administrators, and arts advocates can find rigorous, high-quality resources for Arts Integration which connect to Common Core State Standards and STEM.

With a focus on the classroom practice of arts integration, a nonprofit called Arts Integration Solutions (formerly the Opening Minds through the Arts Foundation) [http://www.artsintegration.com] provides professional development for teachers and program planning and implementation for schools and school districts. AiS has developed a set of tenets that are the basis for arts integration and a cycle that helps teachers develop daily lessons in math, science, reading and writing that use the arts to fully engage students. AiS has developed programming for use of arts integration in teaching the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and Literacy.

==Art education obstacles==
The three major skills in education that are considered the “core” subjects to teach students include math, writing, and reading comprehension. These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.

===No Child Left Behind===
The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04stud.html“Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools]. [[The New York Times]]. (2007). 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.

===School budgets===
While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, “On March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives”.&lt;ref&gt;"The FY11 Budget Deal: What Does It Mean For The Arts?." Electronic Musician 27.7 (2011): 13. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, “In 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida”.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Heather. "The Simple Facts." Teaching Artist Journal 2.3 (2004): 189. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.

Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.

===Practical uses===
Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, "Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;“What Does the NEAP Arts Assessment Measure?” National Center for Educational Statistics. 2009. 16 Nov, 2011. &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/whatmeasure.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today’s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today’s competitive job market.

===Arts integrated teachers===
An issue commonly brought is that “not all teachers are artists,” meaning that there aren’t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oreck |first=Barry |title=Artistic choices: A study of teachers who use the arts in the classroom |url=http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205121705/http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts |accessdate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittrich |last2=Pool |last3=Pool |first=Charles |first2=Jonelle |first3=Ken|title=Arts Integration in Teacher Preparation: Teaching the Teachers|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985616.pdf|publisher=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.

Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.

==The contribution of arts education to children’s development==
The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation. In a society where the entire educational system is based on preparing a future work force, focus is put on the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts are neglected. In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children’s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education. Research shows that children exposed to arts do better in school, develop greater social, cognitive and emotional skills and are more likely to earn higher degrees of education later in life.

===Academic effects===
Participation in arts programs is positively correlated with increased academic achievement, including higher math and verbal SAT scores, when compared to the performance of students without arts education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (2011). Reinvesting in arts education: Winning America’s future through creative schools. http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/PCAH_Reinvesting_4web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS;88), a panel study which has followed more than 25,000 students in American secondary schools for 10 years, show significant results on the positive outcomes from children exposed to high arts in school with a teacher supervising. The study examines the time from 8th grade through 10th and 12th grade and throughout high school. Furthermore, this study, conducted by James Catterall and colleagues, which started in the mid-90s followed up on the same students at age 26 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, J. S. (2009). Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art: The Effects of Education in the Visual and Performing Arts on the Achievements and Values of Young Adults. Los Angeles/London: Imagination Group/I‐Group Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exploratory study published by the [[National Art Education Association]] looked at the integration of arts in classroom curriculum and concluded that this integration enhanced academic learning because of the fully immersive engagement of the arts, which allows students to understand different perspectives, safely take risks, express feelings through less restrictive modes, and draw parallels between the arts and traditional core subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Patricia|date=2007|title=Making Meaning Many Ways: An Exploratory Look at Integrating the Arts with Classroom Curriculum|jstor=27696226|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=4|pages=33–38|doi=10.2307/27696226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-emotional development===
A significant consensus among research on arts education exists and this is that arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, E. B. (1999). Champions of Change - The Impact of the Arts on Learning. Washington, D.C.: The Arts Education Partnership &amp; The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Students failing is commonly explained by disengaged students and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;Achbacher, P. &amp;. (1991). The Humanitas Program evaluation, 1990-91. Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers.  Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance. The confidence, collaboration, and creativity that arts education fosters has a circular, positive effect on academics as well as cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural development===
Positive outcomes by means of socio-cultural development, through exposure to minorities and different cultures, is a contribution of arts education aiming at breaking stereotypes and developing teamwork skills, tolerance and appreciation of diversity. One study, collected by the Association for the Advancement of Arts Education (AAAE), on students’ exposure to Native American music using an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the teaching of instrumental music and bringing in guest artists, showed decreased stereotypical attitudes and greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. These changes were measured by the American Indian Belief Inventory was measured on four groups exposed to Native American culture and a fifth group with no cultural exposure. All of the four groups showed improvement while the fifth control group did not.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, K. (1994). North American Indian Music Instruction : Influences upon attitudes, cultural perceptions, and achievement.D.M.A. dissertation. Tempa, Arizona.: Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies have shown that students with arts education are more civically engaged. This socio-cultural effect of arts integration is disproportionately stronger for at-risk students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Catterall, James|date=March 2012|title=The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth: Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies. Research Report #55.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530822|journal=National Endowment for the Arts|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
Research on the contribution of the arts to the cognitive field show a great array of cognitive developments in spatial-temporal abilities, verbal skills, memory and spatial reasoning.
A study by Chan ''et al.'' using sixty female college students in the U.S showed a relationship of the students’ music training before age 12 and their verbal memory. The students with music training showed a significantly better recall than those without formal training. 
A meta-analysis by the American Psychological Association furthermore showed how listening to music can result in progressive relaxation and that listening to classical music one hour a day increases greater brain coherence and more time spent in the alpha state (state of aware relaxation stimulating imagination, intuition and higher awareness).&lt;ref&gt;Malyarenko. (1996). Music Alters Children's Brainwaves, Human Physiology, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on premature babies have also found that while receiving special care and being exposed to classical music they physically and mentally developed significantly faster than those babies who weren’t exposed to classical music.  Further studies have also indicated that incorporating Art into academic education for disabled children better supported cognitive development and improved communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Rawley A. ''Developing Cognitive and Creative Skills through Art: Programs for children with Communication Disorders or Learning Disabilities''. New York. Ablin Press, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration of arts in classroom curriculum ==
Jessica Davis presents eight different frameworks for considering the role of the arts in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jessica Hoffman|date=1999-05-01|title=Nowhere, Somewhere, Everywhere: The Arts in Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10632919909599472|journal=Arts Education Policy Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=23–28|doi=10.1080/10632919909599472|issn=1063-2913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gullatt|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Enhancing Student Learning through Arts Integration: Implications for the Profession|jstor=40364094|journal=The High School Journal|volume=91|issue=4|pages=12–25|doi=10.1353/hsj.0.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her categories and methods are as follows:
# ''Arts-Based -'' Art is at the core of learning, providing a lens through which students can understand other subjects. Art serves as the basic threshold for general learning.
# ''Arts-Injected (or Infused) -'' Art is "injected" from the outside as a matter of enrichment (e.g., a period of music, visiting artists, etc.)
# ''Arts-Included'' - Art is offered alongside traditional curriculum, not necessarily for interdisciplinary purposes but rather as its own course of study.
# ''Arts-Expansion'' - Art is an exploratory adventure that takes students outside of school (e.g., field trips to a museum, concert hall, etc.)
# ''Arts-Professional'' - This approach treats art training as a means for a professional career in the arts, and turning students into artists is the primary goal.
# ''Arts-Extras'' - Art is sometimes offered as an additional commitment outside of regular school curriculum (e.g., school newspaper, after-school dance clubs, etc.).
# ''Arts-Education -'' Referred to by some as aesthetic education, this approach uses art as a way of knowing, turning its study more philosophical to interpret and apply to experiences.
# ''Arts-Cultura'' - Art connects individual students' "culture" to collective community "cultures" to more structured racial/national "Cultures" to the ultimate universal "Culture." It is through this interplay that art encourages students to take risks, think critically, and make meaning.
It is often difficult to fully integrate the arts with traditional classroom instruction in a way that allows for the arts-cultura model. This is largely due to the disconnect between art teachers and teachers of other subjects, who are not given the time or ability to coordinate and interweave lesson plans that apply art to core subjects and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arts Technology Integration ===
As technology continually advances, arts integration evolves to match. The challenge in integrating arts in today's technology-first education lies not in implementing production labs on school campuses or accessing the latest computer software, but rather in effectively managing the sheer amount of information that technology makes available. Students must learn to select relevant data, assess these data, and draw critically from them in order to make meaning, answer questions, or form new ones. Technology also presents more channels of expression, whether through digital art or artificial intelligence, which, if supported by arts-technology integration, can cultivate the experimentation and inquiry that arts education champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Sherry|date=2007|title=Implications for Art Education in the Third Millennium: Art Technology Integration|jstor=27696216|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=3|pages=45–51|doi=10.2307/27696216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO Arts Integration Program ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a special agency of the UN that operates from Paris, France, advocates the need for the integration of arts, culture, and creativity in all educational platforms worldwide. This agenda is in line with the structure of “Quality Education” and “Education for All” to support methodologies for promoting and protecting diversity of cultural manifestation. For example, UNESCO Bangkok took the initiative of upholding research activities related to Arts Education and swap of information along with case studies among educators, artists, and other stakeholders within Asia and the Pacific. The very first international congress on arts education was held in Seoul (Korea) in 2006 and the second in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bangkok.unesco.org/content/releasing-power-arts-%E2%80%93-exploring-arts-education-asia-pacific|title=Releasing the Power of the Arts – Exploring Arts Education in the Asia-Pacific|work=UNESCO Bangkok|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Due to current economic recession many schools across see their arts programs cut off in favor of core curriculum subject such as English, math and science. Despite the lack of apparent and secure job possibilities within the arts and a pressuring need for a strong work force within the [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) research show that arts education is crucial in children’s learning process and development. In 2013 a congressional resolution sought to include "A" for Art in the STEM acronym, changing it to STEAM.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf |title=H. RES. 51 House of Representatives Joint Resolution|year=2012 |author= |publisher=113th Congress, 2013–2015|accessdate=2013-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that children exposed to arts education throughout childhood through primary, secondary and tertiary school show greater scores on academic achievements as well as greater social, cultural, emotional and cognitive development. Some of the measured improvement are greater self-confidence, communicative skills, cultural awareness and sensitivity alongside greater stimulated creativity and overall academic achievement.

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}
The '''broken windows theory''' is a [[Criminology|criminological]] theory that visible signs of [[crime]], [[anti-social behavior]], and [[civil disorder]] create an [[Urban area|urban environment]] that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory thus suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as [[vandalism]], public drinking, and [[fare evasion]] help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes.

The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists [[James Q. Wilson]] and [[George L. Kelling]].{{sfn|Wilson|Kelling|1982}} It was further popularized in the 1990s by [[New York City]] police commissioner [[William Bratton]] and Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], whose policing policies were influenced by the theory.

The theory has been subject to great debate both within the [[social science]]s and the public sphere. In some cases,{{clarify|date=July 2018}} broken windows policing has become associated with controversial police practices such as the use of "[[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|stop, question, and frisk]]" by the [[New York City Police Department]]. In response, Bratton and Kelling have written that broken windows policing should not be treated as "[[zero tolerance]]" or "zealotry", but as a method that requires "careful training, guidelines and supervision" and a positive relationship with communities, thus linking it to [[community policing]].

==Article and crime prevention==
[[File:Broken_windows,_Northampton_State_Hospital.jpg|thumb|The broken windows of an abandoned hospital building in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]]]
James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling first introduced the broken windows theory in an article titled "Broken Windows", in the March 1982 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}} The title comes from the following example:
{{quote |Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it's unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.

Or consider a pavement. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of refuse from take-out restaurants there or even break into cars.}}

The article received a great deal of attention and was very widely cited. A 1996 [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]] book, ''Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities'' by [[George L. Kelling]] and Catharine Coles, is based on the article but develops the argument in greater detail. It discusses the theory in relation to [[crime]] and strategies to contain or eliminate crime from urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = George| last1 = Kelling | first2 = Catherine | last2 = Coles | title = Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities | isbn = 0-684-83738-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful strategy for preventing vandalism, according to the book's authors, is to address the problems when they are small. Repair the broken windows within a short time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows or do further damage. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for [[litter]] not to accumulate (or for the rate of littering to be much less). Problems are less likely to escalate and thus "respectable" residents do not flee the neighborhood.

Though police work is crucial to crime prevention, Oscar Newman, in his 1972 book, ''Defensible Space'', wrote that the presence of police authority is not enough to maintain a safe and crime-free city. People in the community help with crime prevention. Newman proposes that people care for and protect spaces they feel invested in, arguing that an area is eventually safer if the people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the area. Broken windows and vandalism are still prevalent because communities simply do not care about the damage. Regardless of how many times the windows are repaired, the community still must invest some of their time to keep it safe. Residents' negligence of broken window-type decay signifies a lack of concern for the community. Newman says this is a clear sign that the society has accepted this disorder—allowing the unrepaired windows to display vulnerability and lack of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Oscar | last = Newman | title = Defensible Space: Crime Prevention Through Urban Design | isbn = 0-02-000750-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm Gladwell also relates this theory to the reality of NYC in his book ''[[The Tipping Point]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gladwell | url = http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/ | title = The tipping point | access-date = 2014-03-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150729063844/http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/# | archive-date = 2015-07-29 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory thus makes two major claims: that further petty crime and low-level anti-social behavior is deterred, and that major crime is prevented as a result. Criticism of the theory has tended to focus disproportionately on the latter claim.&lt;!--Isn't it, 'enforcing small crimes prevents big crimes,' which is one major claim, not two? At best this is a confusing sentence. I'm not sure enough what it's trying to say to fully rewrite it. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/ |title=The Problem with Broken Windows Policing |last=Childress |first=Sarah |date=28 June 2016 |website=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) |publisher=PBS Frontline |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical explanation==
The reason the state of the urban environment may affect crime may be three factors:
* [[social norm]]s and [[conformity]],
* the presence or lack of routine [[surveillance|monitoring]], and
* social signaling and [[signal crime]].

In an anonymous urban environment, with few or no other people around, social norms and monitoring are not clearly known. Individuals thus look for signals within the environment as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms; one of the signals is the area's general appearance.

Under the broken windows theory, an ordered and clean environment, one that is maintained, sends the signal that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior is not tolerated. Conversely, a disordered environment, one that is not maintained (broken windows, graffiti, excessive litter), sends the signal that the area is not monitored and that criminal behavior has little risk of detection.

The theory assumes that the landscape "communicates" to people. A broken window transmits to criminals the message that a community displays a lack of informal social control and so is unable or unwilling to defend itself against a criminal invasion. It is not so much the actual broken window that is important, but the message the broken window sends to people. It symbolizes the community's defenselessness and vulnerability and represents the lack of [[group cohesiveness|cohesiveness]] of the people within. Neighborhoods with a strong sense of cohesion fix broken windows and assert social responsibility on themselves, effectively giving themselves control over their space.

The theory emphasizes the built environment, but must also consider human behavior.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

Under the impression that a broken window left unfixed leads to more serious problems, residents begin to change the way they see their community. In an attempt to stay safe, a cohesive community starts to fall apart, as individuals start to spend less time in communal space to avoid potential violent attacks by strangers.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} The slow deterioration of a community as a result of broken windows modifies the way people behave when it comes to their communal space, which, in turn, breaks down community control. As rowdy teenagers, panhandlers, addicts, and prostitutes slowly make their way into a community, it signifies that the community cannot assert informal social control, and citizens become afraid that worse things will happen. As a result, they spend less time in the streets to avoid these subjects and feel less and less connected from their community if the problems persist.

At times, residents tolerate "broken windows" because they feel they belong in the community and "know their place." Problems, however, arise when outsiders begin to disrupt the community's cultural fabric. That is the difference between "regulars" and "strangers" in a community. The way that "regulars" act represents the culture within, but strangers are "outsiders" who do not belong.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

Consequently, daily activities considered "normal" for residents now become uncomfortable, as the culture of the community carries a different feel from the way that it was once.

With regard to social geography, the broken windows theory is a way of explaining people and their interactions with space. The culture of a community can deteriorate and change over time with the influence of unwanted people and behaviors changing the landscape. The theory can be seen as people shaping space as the civility and attitude of the community create spaces used for specific purposes by residents. On the other hand, it can also be seen as space shaping people with elements of the environment influencing and restricting day-to-day decision making.

However, with policing efforts to remove unwanted disorderly people that put fear in the public’s eyes, the argument would seem to be in favor of "people shaping space" as public policies are enacted and help to determine how one is supposed to behave. All spaces have their own codes of conduct, and what is considered to be right and normal will vary from place to place.

The concept also takes into consideration spatial exclusion and social division as certain people behaving in a given way are considered disruptive and therefore unwanted. It excludes people from certain spaces because their behavior does not fit the class level of the community and its surroundings. A community has its own standards and communicates a strong message to criminals, by social control, that their neighborhood does not tolerate their behavior. If however, a community is unable to ward off would-be criminals on their own, policing efforts help.

By removing unwanted people from the streets, the residents feel safer and have a higher regard for those that protect them. People of less civility who try to make a mark in the community are removed, according to the theory.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Excluding the unruly and people of certain social statuses is an attempt to keep the balance and cohesiveness of a community.

==Concepts==
===Informal social controls===
Many claim that [[informal social control]]s can be an effective strategy to reduce unruly behavior. {{Harvnb | Garland | 2001}} expresses that “community policing measures in the realization that informal social control exercised through everyday relationships and institutions is more effective than legal sanctions”.{{Sfn | Garland | 2001}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Informal social control methods, has demonstrated a “get tough” attitude by proactive citizens, and expresses a sense that disorderly conduct is not tolerated. According to Wilson and Kelling, there are two types of groups involved in maintaining order, ‘community watchmen’ and ‘[[vigilante]]s’{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} The United States has adopted in many ways policing strategies of old European times, and at that time informal social control was the norm, which gave rise to contemporary formal policing. Though, in earlier times, there were no legal sanctions to follow, informal policing was primarily ‘objective’ driven as stated by Wilson and Kelling (1982).

{{Harvnb | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004}} argue that improper [[land use]] can cause disorder, and the larger the public land is, the more susceptible to criminal deviance.{{Sfn | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004 | p = 186}} Therefore, nonresidential spaces such as businesses, may assume to the responsibility of informal social control “in the form of [[surveillance]], communication, supervision, and intervention.”{{Sfn | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004 | p = 187}} It is expected that more strangers occupying the public land creates a higher chance for disorder. [[Jane Jacobs]] can be considered one of the original pioneers of this perspective of ''broken windows''. Much of her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' focuses on residents' and nonresidents' contributions to maintaining order on the street, and explains how local businesses, institutions, and convenience stores provide a sense of having "eyes on the street."{{Sfn | Jacobs | 1961}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

On the contrary, many residents feel that regulating disorder is not their responsibility. Wilson and Kelling found that studies done by psychologists suggest people often refuse to go to the aid of someone seeking help, not due to a lack of concern or selfishness “but the absence of some plausible grounds for feeling that one must personally accept responsibility”{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} On the other hand, others plainly refuse to put themselves in harm's way, depending on how grave they perceive the nuisance to be; a 2004 study observed that "most research on disorder is based on individual level perceptions decoupled from a systematic concern with the disorder-generating environment."{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 319}} Essentially, everyone perceives disorder differently, and can contemplate seriousness of a crime based on those perceptions. However, Wilson and Kelling feel that although community involvement can make a difference, “the police are plainly the key to order maintenance.”{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===Role of fear===
Ranasinghe argues that the concept of fear is a crucial element of broken windows theory, because it is the foundation of the theory.{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 65}} She also adds that public disorder is “...unequivocally constructed as problematic because it is a source of fear.”{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 67}} Fear is elevated as perception of disorder rises; creating a social pattern that tears the social fabric of a community, and leaves the residents feeling hopeless and disconnected. Wilson and Kelling hint at the idea, but don’t focus on its central importance. They indicate that fear was a product of incivility, not crime, and that people avoid one another in response to fear, weakening controls.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Hinkle and Weisburd found that police interventions to combat minor offenses, as per the broken windows model, "significantly increased the probability of feeling unsafe," suggesting that such interventions might offset any benefits of broken windows policing in terms of fear reduction.{{sfn|Hinkle|Weisburd|2008}}

===Difference with "zero tolerance"===
Broken windows policing is sometimes described as a "[[zero tolerance]]" policing style,&lt;ref name="The Broken Windows Theory"&gt;{{Citation | last = Adams | first = Joan | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/220030885/| title = The "Broken Windows" Theory | year = 2006 | publisher = UBC | place = [[Canada]] | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in some academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sridhar|first=C.R.|title=Broken Windows and Zero Tolerance: Policing Urban Crimes|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date= 13–19 May 2006|volume= 41|issue= 19|pages= 1841–43|jstor= 4418196}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several key proponents such as Bratton and Kelling argue that there is a key difference. In 2014, they outlined a difference between "broken windows policing" and "zero tolerance":
{{quote|Critics use the term “zero tolerance” in a pejorative sense to suggest that Broken Windows policing is a form of zealotry—the imposition of rigid, moralistic standards of behavior on diverse populations. It is not. Broken Windows is a highly discretionary police activity that requires careful training, guidelines, and supervision, as well as an ongoing dialogue with neighborhoods and communities to ensure that it is properly conducted&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/why-we-need-broken-windows-policing-13696.html|title=Why we need Broken Windows policing|publisher=City Journal|author=William Bratton, George Kelling|date=December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Bratton and Kelling advocate that authorities should be effective at catching minor offenders while also giving them lenient punishment. Citing [[fare evasion]] as an example, they argue that the police should attempt to catch fare evaders, and that the vast majority should be [[Summons|summoned]] to court rather than arrested and given a punishment other than jail. The goal is to deter minor offenders from committing more serious crimes in the future and reduce the prison population in the long run.&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"/&gt;

==Critical developments==
In an earlier publication of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' released March, 1982, Wilson wrote an article indicating that police efforts had gradually shifted from maintaining order to fighting crime.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} This indicated that order maintenance was something of the past, and soon it would seem as it has been put on the back burner. The shift was attributed to the rise of the social urban riots of the 1960s, and "social scientists began to explore carefully the order maintenance function of the police, and to suggest ways of improving it—not to make streets safer (its original function) but to reduce the incidence of mass violence".{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Other criminologists argue between similar disconnections, for example, Garland argues that throughout the early and mid 20th century, police in American cities strived to keep away from the neighborhoods under their jurisdiction.{{Sfn | Garland | 2001}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} This is a possible indicator of the out-of-control social riots that were prevalent at that time. Still many would agree that reducing crime and violence begins with maintaining social control/order.

[[Jane Jacobs]]' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' is discussed in detail by Ranasinghe, and its importance to the early workings of broken windows, and claims that Kelling's original interest in "minor offences and disorderly behaviour and conditions" was inspired by Jacobs' work.{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 68}} Ranasinghe includes that Jacobs' approach toward social disorganization was centralized on the "streets and their sidewalks, the main public places of a city" and that they "are its most vital organs, because they provide the principal visual scenes."{{Sfn | Jacobs | 1961 | p = 378}} Wilson and Kelling, as well as Jacobs, argue on the concept of civility (or the lack thereof) and how it creates lasting distortions between crime and disorder. Ranasinghe explains that the common framework of both set of authors is to narrate the problem facing urban public places. Jacobs, according to Ranasinghe, maintains that "Civility functions as a means of informal social control, subject little to institutionalized norms and processes, such as the law" 'but rather maintained through an' "intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among people... and enforced by the people themselves."{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 72}}

==Case studies==
{{see also|Graffiti in the United States#Government response|label 1=Government response to graffiti}}

===Precursor experiments===
Before the introduction of this theory by Wilson and Kelling, [[Philip Zimbardo]], a Stanford psychologist, arranged an experiment testing the broken-window theory in 1969. Zimbardo arranged for an automobile with no license plates and the hood up to be parked idle in a [[Bronx]] neighbourhood and a second automobile in the same condition to be set up in [[Palo Alto, California]]. The car in the Bronx was attacked within minutes of its abandonment. Zimbardo noted that the first "vandals" to arrive were a family&amp;nbsp;– a father, mother and a young son&amp;nbsp;– who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours of its abandonment, everything of value had been stripped from the vehicle. After that, the car's windows were smashed in, parts torn, upholstery ripped, and children were using the car as a playground. At the same time, the vehicle sitting idle in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week until Zimbardo himself went up to the vehicle and deliberately smashed it with a sledgehammer. Soon after, people joined in for the destruction. Zimbardo observed that a majority of the adult "vandals" in both cases were primarily well dressed, Caucasian, clean-cut and seemingly respectable individuals. It is believed that, in a neighborhood such as the Bronx where the history of abandoned property and theft are more prevalent, vandalism occurs much more quickly as the community generally seems apathetic. Similar events can occur in any civilized community when communal barriers—the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility—are lowered by actions that suggest apathy.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===New York City===
{{See also|Crime in New York City}}
In 1985, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] hired [[George L. Kelling]], the author of ''Broken Windows'', as a consultant. Kelling was later hired as a consultant to the [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] and the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] police departments.

One of Kelling's adherents, [[David L. Gunn]] implemented policies and procedures based on the Broken Windows Theory during his tenure as President of the New York City Transit Authority. One of his major efforts was to lead a campaign from 1984 to 1990 to rid [[graffiti]] from New York's subway system.

In 1990, [[William J. Bratton]] became head of the [[New York City Transit Police]]. Bratton was influenced by Kelling, describing him as his "intellectual mentor". In his role he implemented a tougher stance on [[fare evasion]], faster [[arrest|arrestee processing]] methods, and [[background check]]s on all those arrested.

After being elected [[Mayor of New York City]] in 1993 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Rudy Giuliani]] hired Bratton as his [[police commissioner]] to implement similar policies and practices throughout the city. Giuliani heavily subscribed to Kelling and Wilson's theories. Such policies emphasized addressing crimes that negatively affect [[quality of life]]. In particular, Bratton directed the police to more strictly enforce laws against subway fare evasion, [[public drinking]], [[public urination]], and graffiti. He increased enforcement against "[[squeegee men]]", those who aggressively demand payment at traffic stops for unsolicited car window cleanings. Bratton also revived the [[New York City Cabaret Law]], a previously dormant Prohibition era ban on dancing in unlicensed establishments. Throughout the late 1990s NYPD shut down many of the city's acclaimed night spots for illegal dancing.

According to a 2001 study of crime trends in New York City by Kelling and William Sousa, rates of both petty and serious crime fell significantly after the aforementioned policies were implemented. Furthermore, crime continued to decline for the following ten years. Such declines suggested that policies based on the Broken Windows Theory were [[effective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Corman|first=Hope|title=Carrots, Sticks and Broken Windows|date=Jun 2002|url=http://courses.washington.edu/pbaf512a/Carrotspaper.June13.pdf|publisher=Washington|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|subscription=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies do not find a [[cause and effect]] relationship between the adoption of such policies and decreases in crime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ludwig | first = Jens | year = 2006 | title = Broken windows | url = http://home.uchicago.edu/~ludwigj/papers/Broken_windows_2006.pdf | publisher = U Chicago | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease may have been part of a broader trend across the United States. Other cities also experienced less crime, even though they had different police policies. Other factors, such as the 39% drop in New York City's [[unemployment rate]], could also explain the decrease reported by Kelling and Sousa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Criticism for Giuliani's broken windows theory |date=Aug 2013 | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/criticism-for-giulianis-broken-windows-theory-2013-8 | newspaper = Business insider}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that when the New York Police Department (NYPD) stopped aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes in late 2014 and early 2015 that civilian complaints of three major crimes (burglary, felony assault, and grand larceny) decreased (slightly with large error bars) during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. There was no statistically significant effect on other major crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, or grand theft auto. These results are touted as challenging prevailing scholarship as well as conventional wisdom on authority and legal compliance by implying that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Christopher M.|last2=O’Keeffe|first2=Zachary P.|date=2017-09-25|title=Evidence that curtailing proactive policing can reduce major crime|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0211-5|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0211-5|issn=2397-3374|volume=1|issue=10|pages=730–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albuquerque===
[[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], instituted the Safe Streets Program in the late 1990s based on the Broken Windows Theory. Operating under the theory that American [[Western United States|Westerners]] use roadways much in the same way that American [[Eastern United States|Easterners]] use subways, the developers of the program reasoned that lawlessness on the roadways had much the same effect as it did on the [[New York City Subway]]. Effects of the program were reviewed by the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and were published in a case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/SafeStreets/ | place = US | publisher = Department of Transportation – NHTSA | title = Albuquerque Police Department's Safe streets program | id = DOT HS 809 278 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403093901/http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/SafeStreets/ | archivedate = 2015-04-03 | df = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowell, Massachusetts===
In 2005, [[Harvard University]] and [[Suffolk University]] researchers worked with local police to identify 34 "crime hot spots" in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged [[loitering|loiterers]], made more [[misdemeanor]] arrests, and expanded [[community mental health service|mental health services]] and aid for the [[homeless]]. In the other half of the identified locations, there was no change to routine police service.

The areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment was more effective than misdemeanor arrests and that increasing social services had no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.suffolk.edu/34417.html | publisher = Suffolk University | title = Research Boosts Broken Windows | accessdate = 2009-02-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090629171649/http://www.suffolk.edu/34417.html | archivedate = 2009-06-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/02/08/breakthrough_on_broken_windows/ |title = Breakthrough on 'broken windows’ |accessdate= 2009-02-20 |work= The Boston Globe |first= Carolyn Y | last = Johnson | date = 2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In 2007 and 2008, Kees Keizer and colleagues from the [[University of Groningen]] conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine if the effect of existing visible disorder (such as litter or graffiti) increased other crime such as theft, littering, or other [[antisocial behavior]]. They selected several urban locations, which they arranged in two different ways, at different times. In each experiment, there was a "disorder" condition in which violations of social norms as prescribed by signage or national custom, such as graffiti and littering, were clearly visible as well as a control condition where no violations of norms had taken place. The researchers then secretly monitored the locations to observe if people behaved differently when the environment was "disordered". Their observations supported the theory. The conclusion was published in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]: "One example of disorder, like graffiti or littering, can indeed encourage another, like stealing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1161405 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1161405 |last1 =Keizer |first1 =K |last2=Lindenberg |first2=S |last3=Steg |first3=L |title=The Spreading of Disorder |accessdate =2008-11-28 |journal= Science |volume= 322 |issue= 5908 |pages= 1681–1685 |year=2008 |pmid= 19023045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12630201 |title= Can the can | accessdate=2008-11-24 |work=The Economist |date= 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other advantages==

===Real estate===
Other side effects of better monitoring and cleaned up streets may well be desired by governments or housing agencies and the population of a neighborhood: broken windows can count as an indicator of low real estate value and may deter investors. Fixing windows is therefore also a step of [[real estate development]], which may lead, whether it is desired or not, to [[gentrification]]. By reducing the amount of broken windows in the community, the inner cities would appear to be attractive to consumers with more capital. Ridding spaces like downtown New York and Chicago, notably notorious for criminal activity, of danger would draw in investment from consumers, increasing the city's economic status, providing a safe and pleasant image for present and future inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/73.1/73_1_Harcourt_Ludwig.pdf | first1 = Bernard L | last1 = Harcourt | first2 = Jens | last2 = Ludwig | title = Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130228134225/http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/73.1/73_1_Harcourt_Ludwig.pdf | archivedate = 2013-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In education, the broken windows theory is used to promote order in classrooms and school cultures. The belief is that students are signaled by disorder or rule-breaking and that they in turn imitate the disorder. Several school movements encourage strict paternalistic practices to enforce student discipline. Such practices include language codes (governing slang, curse words, or speaking out of turn), classroom etiquette (sitting up straight, tracking the speaker), personal dress (uniforms, little or no jewelry), and behavioral codes (walking in lines, specified bathroom times).

From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from [[Johns Hopkins University]] conducted a correlational study to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy.&lt;ref name = schools&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Plank|first1 =Stephen B | last2 =Bradshaw | first2 = Catherine P | last3 = Young | first3 = Hollie|title= An Application of "Broken‐Windows" and Related Theories to the Study of Disorder, Fear, and Collective Efficacy in Schools|journal=American Journal of Education|date= 1 February 2009|volume= 115 | issue = 2 | pages=227–47|doi=10.1086/595669}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large [[mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. The conclusion, published in the ''[[American Journal of Education]]'', was
{{quote|...the findings of the current study suggest that educators and researchers should be vigilant about factors that influence student perceptions of climate and safety. Fixing broken windows and attending to the physical appearance of a school cannot alone guarantee productive teaching and learning, but ignoring them likely greatly increases the chances of a troubling downward spiral.&lt;ref name=schools /&gt;}}

==Policing==
'''Broken windows policing''' is a form of policing based on broken windows theory. It is also sometimes called '''quality-of-life policing'''. [[William J. Bratton]] popularized this policing strategy as New York City's police commissioner during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/nyregion/eric-garner-police-chokehold-staten-island.html?_r=0 |title=Beyond the Chokehold: The Path to Eric Garner's Death |last=Baker |first=Al |website=The New York Times |publication-date=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Other factors===
Many critics state that factors other than physical disorder more significantly influence crime rate. They argue that efforts to more effectively reduce crime rate should target or pay more attention to such factors instead.

According to a study by [[Robert J. Sampson]] and [[Stephen Raudenbush]], the premise on which the theory operates, that social disorder and crime are connected as part of a causal chain, is faulty. They argue that a third factor, collective efficacy, "defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space," is the actual cause of varying crime rates that are observed in an altered neighborhood environment. They also argue that the relationship between public disorder and crime rate is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sampson| first1 = Robert J.| last2 = Raudenbush | first2 = Stephen W | title = Systematic Social Observation of Public Spaces: A New Look at Disorder in Urban Neighborhoods |journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1 November 1999|volume=105|issue=3|pages = 603–51 | doi = 10.1086/210356|url=http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/NeighborhoodCrime.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. R. Sridhar, in his article in the ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'', also challenges the theory behind broken windows policing and the idea that the policies of [[William Bratton]] and the [[New York Police Department]] was the cause of the decrease of crime rates in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sridhar|first=C.R.|title=Broken Windows and Zero Tolerance: Policing Urban Crimes|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date= 13–19 May 2006|volume= 41|issue= 19|pages= 1841–43|jstor= 4418196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy targeted people in areas with a significant amount of physical disorder and there appeared to be a causal relationship between the adoption of broken windows policing and the decrease in crime rate. Sridhar, however, discusses other trends (such as New York City's economic boom in the late 1990s) that created a "[[perfect storm]]" that contributed to the decrease of crime rate much more significantly than the application of the broken windows policy. Sridhar also compares this decrease of crime rate with other major cities that adopted other various policies and determined that the broken windows policy is not as effective.

Baltimore criminologist Ralph B. Taylor argues in his book that fixing windows is only a partial and short-term solution. His data supports a materialist view: changes in levels of physical decay, superficial social disorder, and racial composition do not lead to higher crime, but economic decline does. He contends that the example shows that real, long-term reductions in crime require that urban politicians, businesses, and community leaders work together to improve the economic fortunes of residents in high-crime areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph B. Taylor. Breaking Away from Broken Windows: Baltimore Neighborhoods and the Nationwide Fight Against Crime, Grime, Fear, and Decline. {{ISBN|0813397588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tack was taken by a 2010 study questioning the legitimacy of the theory concerning the subjectivity of disorder as perceived by persons living in neighborhoods. It concentrated on whether citizens view disorder as a separate issue from crime or as identical to it. The study noted that crime cannot be the result of disorder if the two are identical, agreed that disorder provided evidence of "convergent validity" and concluded that broken windows theory misinterprets the relationship between disorder and crime.{{Sfn | Gau | Pratt | 2010}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the correlation between environmental lead levels and crime. Specifically, there appears to be a correlation with a 25-year lag with the addition and removal of lead from paint and gasoline and rises and falls in murder arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Lucifer_Curves_2-22-15.pdf Lucifer Curves] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225100935/http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Lucifer_Curves_2-22-15.pdf |date=February 25, 2015 }}, Rick Nevin, 22 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline America's Real Criminal Element: Lead], ''Mother Jones'', January/February 2013 Issue, Kevin Drum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit bias===
Robert J. Sampson argues that based on common misconceptions by the masses, it is clearly implied that those who commit disorder and crime have a clear tie to groups suffering from financial instability and may be of minority status: "The use of racial context to encode disorder does not necessarily mean that people are racially prejudiced in the sense of personal hostility." He notes that residents make a clear implication of who they believe is causing the disruption, which has been termed as implicit bias.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 320}} He further states that research conducted on implicit bias and stereotyping of cultures suggests that community members hold unrelenting beliefs of African-Americans and other disadvantaged minority groups, associating them with crime, violence, disorder, welfare, and undesirability as neighbors.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 320}} A later study indicated that this contradicted Wilson and Kelling's proposition that disorder is an exogenous construct that has independent effects on how people feel about their neighborhoods.{{Sfn | Gau | Pratt | 2010}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===Criminology===
According to some criminologists who speak of a broader "backlash,"{{Efn | The term "backlash" refers to the wave of "tough-on-crime" policies in the U.S. beginning in the 1980s.}} the broken windows theory is not theoretically sound.&lt;ref name= "Order Maintenance Reconsidered"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Thacher | first=David | year=2004 | url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7152&amp;context=jclc | title=Order Maintenance Reconsidered: Moving beyond Strong Causal Reasoning | format=PDF | publisher=Northwestern University School of Law | journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=94 |issue=2 |doi=10.2307/3491374 | page=381| jstor=3491374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} They claim that the "broken windows theory" closely relates [[correlation]] with [[causality]], a reasoning prone to [[correlation does not imply causation|fallacy]]. David Thacher, assistant professor of public policy and urban planning at the [[University of Michigan]], stated in a 2004 paper:&lt;ref name= "Order Maintenance Reconsidered" /&gt;{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}
{{quote|[S]ocial science has not been kind to the broken windows theory. A number of scholars reanalyzed the initial studies that appeared to support it.... Others pressed forward with new, more sophisticated studies of the relationship between disorder and crime. The most prominent among them concluded that the relationship between disorder and serious crime is modest, and even that relationship is largely an artifact of more fundamental social forces.}}

It has also been argued that rates of major crimes also dropped in many other US cities during the 1990s, both those that had adopted broken windows policing and those that had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Bernard E | last = Harcourt | title = Illusion of Order: The False Promise of Broken Windows Policing | publisher = Harvard | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-674-01590-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter 2006 edition of the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'', [[Bernard Harcourt]] and Jens Ludwig looked at the later [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] program that rehoused inner-city project tenants in New York into more-orderly neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harcourt |first1 =Bernard E | last2 =Ludwig | first2 = Jens |ssrn= 743284 | title =Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume= 73 |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken windows theory would suggest that these tenants would commit less crime once moved because of the more stable conditions on the streets. However, Harcourt and Ludwig found that the tenants continued to commit crime at the same rate.

In a 2007 study called "Reefer Madness" in the journal ''Criminology and Public Policy'', Harcourt and Ludwig found further evidence confirming that [[regression toward the mean|mean reversion]] fully explained the changes in crime rates in the different precincts in New York in the 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harcourt|first=Bernard|last2=Ludwig|first2=Jens|year=2007|title=Reefer Madness: Broken Windows Policing and Misdemeanor Marijuana Arrests in New York City, 1989-2000|url=http://www3.law.columbia.edu/bharcourt/documents/marijuana-arrests.pdf|journal=Criminology and Public Policy|volume=6|pages=165–182|via=Columbia.edu|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2007.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further alternative explanations that have been put forward include the waning of the [[crack epidemic (United States)|crack epidemic]],&lt;ref name="SLATE1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2141424/ |last= Metcalf | first =Stephen |title=The Giuliani Presidency?

===Drawbacks in practice===
Broken windows policing has sometimes become associated with zealotry, which has led to critics suggesting that it encourages discriminatory behaviour. Some campaigns such as [[Black Lives Matter]] have called for an end to broken windows policing.&lt;ref name="NYT_campaignzero"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maloney|first1=Alli|title=When police turn violent, activists Brittany Packnett and Johnetta Elzie push back|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/29/when-police-turn-violent-activists-brittany-packnett-and-johnetta-elzie-push-back/|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Women in the World|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] report argued that it had led the [[Baltimore Police Department]] discriminating against and alienating minority groups.

In response, Kelling and Bratton have argued that broken windows policing does not discriminate against law-abiding communities of minority groups if implemented properly.&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/why-we-need-broken-windows-policing-13696.html|title=Why we need Broken Windows policing|publisher=City Journal|author=William Bratton, George Kelling|date=December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited ''Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wesley G | last = Skogan | title = Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study by Wesley Skogan at the [[University of California]]. The study, which surveyed 13,000 residents of large cities, concluded that different ethnic groups have similar ideas as to what they would consider to be "disorder".

A low-level intervention of police in neighborhoods has been considered problematic. Accordingly, Gary Stewart wrote, "The central drawback of the approaches advanced by Wilson, Kelling, and Kennedy rests in their shared blindness to the potentially harmful impact of broad police discretion on minority communities."{{Sfn | Stewart | 1998}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} It was seen by the authors, who worried that people would be arrested "for the 'crime' of being undesirable". According to Stewart, arguments for low-level police intervention, including the broken windows hypothesis, often act "as cover for [[racist]] behavior".{{Sfn | Stewart | 1998}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

A common criticism of broken policing is the argument that it criminalizes the poor and homeless. That is because the physical signs that characterize a neighborhood with the "disorder" that broken windows policing targets correlate with the socio-economic conditions of its inhabitants. Many of the acts that are considered legal but "disorderly" are often targeted in public settings and are not targeted when they are conducted in private. Therefore, those without access to a private space are often criminalized. Critics, such as [[Robert J. Sampson]] and [[Stephen Raudenbush]] of [[Harvard University]], see the application of the broken windows theory in policing as a war against the poor, as opposed to a war against more serious crimes.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

In [[Dorothy Roberts]]'s article, "Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order Maintenance and Policing", she focuses on problems of the application of the broken windows theory, which lead to the criminalization of communities of color, who are typically disfranchised.&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson|first=Bruce D. |author2=Golub, Andrew |author3=McCabe, James|title=The international implications of quality‐of‐life policing as practiced in New York City|journal=Police Practice and Research |date=1 February 2010 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1080/15614260802586368|pmc=2847857 |pmid=20368765}}&lt;/ref&gt; She underscores the dangers of vaguely written ordinances that allows for law enforcers to determine who engages in disorderly acts, which, in turn, produce a racially skewed outcome in crime statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Dorothy |title=Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order-Maintenance Policing|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |date=Spring 1999 |volume=89 |issue=3 |series=3|pages=775–836|jstor=1144123|doi=10.2307/1144123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bruce D. Johnson, Andrew Golub, and James McCabe, the application of the broken windows theory in policing and policymaking can result in development projects that decrease physical disorder but promote undesired [[gentrification]]. Often, when a city is so "improved" in this way, the development of an area can cause the cost of living to rise higher than residents can afford, which forces low-income people, often minorities, out of the area. As the space changes, the middle and upper classes, often white, begin to move into the area, resulting in the gentrification of urban, poor areas. The local residents are affected negatively by such an application of the broken windows theory and end up evicted from their homes as if their presence indirectly contributed to the area’s problem of "physical disorder".&lt;ref name="Golub"/&gt;

===Popular press===
In ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' (University of Chicago Press, 2000), [[economist]] [[John Lott, Jr.]] examined the use of the broken windows approach as well as community- and [[problem-oriented policing]] programs in cities over 10,000 in population, over two decades. He found that the impacts of these policing policies were not very consistent across different types of crime. Lott's book has been [[More Guns, Less Crime#Studies Against|subject to criticism]], but [[More Guns, Less Crime#Support|other groups support]] Lott's conclusions.

In the 2005 book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', coauthors [[Steven D. Levitt]] and [[Stephen J. Dubner]] confirm and question the notion that the broken windows theory was responsible for New York's drop in crime, saying "the pool of potential criminals had dramatically shrunk". Levitt had in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' attributed that possibility to the legalization of abortion with ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which correlated with a decrease, one generation later, in the number of delinquents in the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Donohue | last2 = Levitt | year = 2001 | title = The impact of legalized abortion | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf | publisher = U Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2012 book ''Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society'', [[Jim Manzi]] writes that of the randomized field trials conducted in criminology, only [[nuisance abatement]] per broken windows theory has been successfully replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bailey | first = Ronald | title = The Science of Policy | publisher = The American Conservative | year = 2012 | url = https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-science-of-policy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Manzi | first = Jim | year = 2012 | title = Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1975, the '''Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment''' sought to replace the [[Massachusetts]] State ERA Coalition and carry out the mission of ratifying the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment replaced the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition because, as a coalition, the organization could not legally raise funds for any cause. The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu//oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&amp;uniqueId=sch00522|title=Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment. Records of the Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment, 1975-1976: A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee then became the ERA Implementation Project, which lobbied for reconciliation of existing laws with the ERA vis a vis legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_equal_rights_amendment |title=Home - Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) - Research Guides at Harvard Library |publisher=Guides.library.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8700">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], the '''commutation test''' is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, [[value (Semiotics)|value]] and significance.

==The commutation test==
This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per [[Roman Jakobson]]). Its primary uses are to: 
*identify distinctive signifiers,
*define their significance, and
*divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong ([[Roland Barthes]]).
The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.

==The process==
The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different [[mise en scène]]s or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.

According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:
*Paradigmatic transformations
**[[:wikt:substitution|substitution]];
**[[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]
*Syntagmatic transformations
**[[addition]];
**[[wikt:deletion|deletion]].

==An example==
Take the phrase:
:the man hit the boy.
Now substitute "boy" with "baby", "girl", "child", "pansy", "thief". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A "man" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has [[pejorative]] connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. 

If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.

==Discussion==
The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of [[language]]. Later, it was expanded to cover all [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] systems that have an [[information]]al content. As [[Umberto Eco]] says, "A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else." (1976)

Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the ''signifier'') and the [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] expressed (the ''signified''), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating [[understanding]]. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common [[code (semiotics)|code]], Hence, language evolves dynamically. The [[community]] will identify a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a ''signal'') will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and ''encoded'', i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] or associated with the sign within the broader framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] systems available within the community. When the [[audience]] is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As [[Roman Jakobson]] adds, there will also be an [[emotion]]al element or [[value (Semiotics)|value]] which represents the addresser's [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards the ''thing''. This will either become a [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. 

In [[lexicography]], the fact that a  [[neologism]] is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a [[community]] have a shared [[memory]] of language [[pattern]]s and [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. [[Individual]]s are therefore able to build up a [[cognitive]] framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.

'''Comparative criminal justice''' is a subfield of the study of [[Criminal Justice]] that compares [[justice]] systems worldwide. Such study can take a descriptive, historical, or political approach.&lt;ref name="PLR"&gt;Philip L. Reichel. (2005). ''Comparative Criminal Justice Systems'' (4th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson. {{ISBN|0-13-113159-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the similarities and differences in structure, goals, [[punishment]] and emphasis on rights as well as the history and political stature of different systems. It is common to broadly categorize the functions of a criminal justice system into policing, adjudication (i.e.: courts), and corrections, although other categorization schemes exist. Comparativists study the four different types of [[societies]], their methods of enforcement and their different types of punishment such as capital punishment, and imprisonment. Within these societies they study different types of legal tradition and analyze the issues they solve and create. They use their information in order to learn effective ways of enforcing laws, and to identify and solve problems that may arise within a system due to its methods.

==Societies==
[[File:Supreme Court.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court]]
Comparativists in criminal justice study four different kinds of societies: Folk-communal, Urban-commercial, Urban-industrial, and bureaucratic.&lt;ref name="apsu"&gt;O'Connor, T. August 16, 2010 '''Comparative Criminal Justice''' ''Megalinks in Criminal Justice'' retrieved from http://www.drtomoconnor.com/3040/3040lect01a.htm accessed on July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Folk-communal societies are often seen as primitive and barbaric, they have little specialization among [[law]] enforcers, and let many problems go unpunished to avoid over-criminalization however, once tempers “boil over” and the situation becomes a larger issue, harsh and unusual punishment may be administered. Examples are African or Middle Eastern Tribes, or early [[puritan]] settlements of America. Urban-commercial societies have few written laws and some specialized enforcement for religious or king’s law enforcement. Punishments are inconsistent and usually harsh. Urban-industrial societies enforce laws that prescribe good behavior and give incentives and disincentives for behavior and police are specialized in property crimes such as theft. Finally, bureaucratic societies are today’s modern society. They feature fully developed laws, lawyers, and police forces trained for multiple types of crime. Different “side effects” of these societies include over-criminalization, overcrowding, and even juvenile delinquency due to the extended age of adolescence these societies bring on.&lt;ref name="apsu" /&gt;

==Legal Traditions==
[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|left|thumb|A Map of the Legal systems of the World.]]
Legal traditions play an important role in the development of [[international law]] and justice. Comparativists for criminal justice study these traditions with the intent of finding a way to combine the views of different traditions towards a single view that allows for the successful development of international law.&lt;ref name="zar"&gt;Zartner Falstrom, Dana. "The Role of Legal Tradition in the Development of International Law: Conflict or Compromise" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association, Hotel Intercontinental, New Orleans, LA, Jan 09, 2008 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-10-27 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p212496_index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many comparativists believe that the more states with similar legal views the more likely it is to be able to create international laws that please all.
Reichel (2005) identifies four major legal traditions that each have their own respective body of laws:
*[[Common law]] is found particularly in countries that are current or former members of the [[British Empire]].
*[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries include most of continental Europe and various states in South America and Africa.
*[[Socialist law]] is essentially civil law with major modifications from [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. It is currently only used in China and a few other contemporary [[Communism|Communist]] states, but has had enormous influence on [[Russia]] and the former [[USSR]].
*[[Sharia|Islamic law]] is religiously-inspired law used in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries.

==Punishment==
[[File:Death Penalty World Map.svg|right|thumb|Map of death penalty]]

People who study comparative criminal justice study different forms and use of punishment across societies, including [[capital punishment]]. Fifty-nine countries retain the death penalty as reported in 2007.&lt;ref name="over"&gt;Overview of the Death Penalty Worldwide as of 2008. http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; Comparativists study the different ways in which execution is carried out across the world including hanging, shooting, beheading, injection, electrocution, and even stoning.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Comparativists find that in many developing countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Belarus, and many others, that violent methods of execution such as hanging beheading, shooting, and stoning are much more common ways of carrying out the death penalty, and in many cases the only ways. However in western culture as well as developed countries such as the United States less brutal execution such as lethal injection is utilized.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Even prison sentences can come harshly.  In many countries such as Burma a person can be sentenced to prison for merely disagreeing with the government.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;Top 10 Longest Prison Sentences in the World. Avery, L. May 2008. accessed on 28 October 2009 at {{cite web |url=http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161325/http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably ridiculous sentences such as multiple life sentences or sentences of hundreds, even thousands of years are meant to prohibit the chance of parole in the future.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt; Although it may seem preposterous, western cultures carry out the same type of sentencing.
Even though similar sentences are used across the globe leniency is varied widely between societies. Many governments such as the one mentioned above in Burma provide swift and heavy punishment to assert their roles of power.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;

[[File:Composition5r.jpg|thumb|Composition 1920x1080]]
'''Composition studies''' (also referred to as '''composition and [[rhetoric]]''', '''rhetoric and composition''', '''writing studies''', or simply '''composition''') is the professional field of [[writing]], research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take [[freshman]]—sometimes even higher—composition courses. 

Over seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccccdoctoralconsortium.org/members/ Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; programs which usually include study of [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|composition pedagogical theory]], [[research methodologies in rhetoric and composition]], and [[Rhetoric|the history of rhetoric]]. Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genreacrossborders.org/ Genre Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]] (TESOL), [[writing center]]s, and [[new literacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://compfaqs.org/CompFAQs/Home?from=Main.HomePage Comp FAQs from CompPile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-year composition==
{{Main|First-year composition}}
Most US universities have a required [[first-year composition]] course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.

==Advanced composition==

Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see {{section link||Writing across the curriculum}} below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.

==Graduate studies==

Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdcwss.com Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/04/cccc|title=What Is a Composition and Rhetoric Doctorate?|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-language writing==
{{Main|Second language writing}}
Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]] in his article "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul K. "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context." Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.

The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means "good" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. "Understanding Composing" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to "backwards" parts of the process in order to move "forward" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article "Student Writing Errors in EFL," points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar &lt;ref&gt;Al-Buainain, Haifa. "Student Writing Errors in EFL." Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37.&lt;/ref&gt;(17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.

Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article "Inventing the University".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David "Inventing the University," Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses "Inventing the University" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.

Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product." Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests three elements for "good" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess "good" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.

ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.

=== Multicultural pedagogies ===

==== Basis in composition studies ====
While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's "Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students "need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively" (186).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43.3|pages=178–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage "cross-cultural awareness" (191).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in "Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture" describes how studies in "little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings" championed by scholars who "seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general," which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=Beth|year=1999|title=Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=50|pages=393–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for ''College English'', "Service Learning and English Studies," described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Aaron|last2=Anne|first2=Gere|year=1998|title=Service Learning and English Studies: Rethinking 'Public Service|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, In ''Empowering Education,'' Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at "a low-budget college in New York City" several decades ago (10).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowering Education: Critical Teaching for Social Change|last=Shor|first=Ira|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-14786-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=Google Play Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in ''Empowering Education'' demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves "[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words" (55).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, "[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis" (56).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists "subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them" (63).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Critical reception ====
Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege "cross-cultural interactions" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'', Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more "global" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric: Defending Academic Discourse Against Postmodern Pluralism|last=Lazere|first=Donald|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8093-3428-5|location=Carbondale|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Current approaches ====
Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'' and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.

For example, Lisa Eck's "Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''Nervous Conditions'' in her composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eck|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=578–598|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: "I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar" (579).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is ''both'' "not about you" and "about you," and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, "Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach," utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer|year=2010|title=Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach|url=|journal=Composition Forum|volume=22|pages=1–14|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating "local topics," Wilson provides options for students to "investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures" as well as "investigating" the relationships between language and power (8-9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even more important, she insists that "[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways" (9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing across the curriculum==
{{Main|Writing across the curriculum}}
Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/composing-a-community-a-history-of-writing-across-the-curriculum/oclc/318390431&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Composing a community: a history of writing across the curriculum|last=McLeod|first=Susan H|last2=Soven|first2=Margot Iris|date=2006|publisher=Parlor Press|isbn=1932559175|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing in the disciplines==

Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2e.cfm|title=The WAC Clearinghouse|website=wac.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing center==
{{Main|Writing center}}
Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eataw.eu/ |title=European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing |website=eataw.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.

Since [[multimodality]] has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the [[digital studio]] and the multiliteracy center.

'''Correctional psychology''' is the application of basic and applied psychological science or scientifically-oriented professional practice to the justice system to enable the proper classification, treatment, and management of offenders with the goal of reducing risk and improving public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psych-law.lab.asu.edu/forensic--correctional-psychology.html|title=Forensic &amp; Correctional Psychology|website=CLINICAL AND LEGAL JUDGMENT LAB|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other objectives of correctional psychology include contributing to the safety and well-being of staff and  offenders by meeting standards of care for mentally-ill individuals, reducing conflict, creating, monitoring, and providing treatment and rehabilitation programs.&lt;ref&gt;SAGE Publications. (2010, July 8). Revised standards for psychology services in jails, prisons, correctional facilities and agencies. ''ScienceDaily''. Retrieved November 20, 2018 from www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100708171353.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
In the 1900s, the bulk of work under correctional psychology was deciphering who was “feeble minded” and who would most likely have a long life of committing crimes. In 1913, correctional psychology was integrated into the United State’s correctional psychology system,  particularly in a women’s penitentiary in New York. Eleanor Rowland was the first psychologist who determined what offenders could benefit from being placed in programs and who could be safe for society. This process is called ''custody decisions'' or ''treatment decisions''. The first of its kind in the prison classification system, it was integrated into facilities in New Jersey in 1918, also becoming the first state to hire psychologists within correctional facilities. Then in 1924, Wisconsin became the first state to allow psychological evaluations in its prison systems and implemented applications for parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soley|first=G.|last2=Hannon|first2= E.

== Preferences ==

=== Effect of culture ===
Culturally bound preferences and familiarity for music begin in [[infancy]] and continue through [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teo 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Timothy Teo |author2=David J. Hargreaves |author3=June Lee |title=Musical Preference, Identification, and Familiarity: A Multicultural Comparison of Secondary Students From Singapore and the United Kingdom |journal=Journal of Research in(slow Neck?) Music Education|year=2008|volume=56|pages=18–32|doi=10.1177/0022429408322953}}&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to prefer and remember music from their own cultural tradition.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"/&gt;

Familiarity for culturally regular [[Meter (music)|meter]] styles is already in place for young infants of only a few months' age.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"/&gt; The looking times of 4- to 8-month old Western infants indicate that they prefer Western meter in music, while Turkish infants of the same age prefer both Turkish and Western meters (Western meters not being completely unfamiliar in Turkish culture). Both groups preferred either [[meter (music)|meter]] when compared with arbitrary meter.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"/&gt;

In addition to influencing preference for meter, culture affects people's ability to correctly identify music styles. Adolescents from Singapore and the UK rated familiarity and preference for excerpts of [[China|Chinese]], [[Malaysia|Malay]], and [[India]]n music styles.&lt;ref name="Teo 2008"/&gt; Neither group demonstrated a preference for the Indian music samples, although the Singaporean teenagers recognized them. Participants from [[Singapore]] showed higher preference for and ability to recognize the Chinese and Malay samples; [[United Kingdom|UK]] participants showed little preference or recognition for any of the music samples, as those types of music are not present in their native culture.&lt;ref name="Teo 2008"/&gt;

=== Effect of musical experience ===
An individual's musical experience may affect how they formulate preferences for music from their own culture and other cultures.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darrow|first=A.|last2=Haack|first2= P.|last3=Kuribayashi|first3= F.|title=American Nonmusic Majors Descriptors and Preferences for Eastern and Western Musics by Japanese and|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|year=1987|pages=237–248|doi=10.2307/3345076|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Japanese individuals (non-music majors) both indicated preference for [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], but Japanese individuals were more receptive to [[eastern world|Eastern]] music. Among the participants, there was one group with little musical experience and one group that had received supplemental musical experience in their lifetimes. Although both American and Japanese participants disliked formal Eastern styles of music and preferred Western styles of music, participants with greater musical experience showed a wider range of preference responses not specific to their own culture.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1987"/&gt;

=== Dual cultures ===
Bimusicalism is a phenomenon in which people well-versed and familiar with music from two different cultures exhibit dual [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] to both [[music genre|genres of music]].&lt;ref name="Wong 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=P. C. M.|last2=Roy|first2= A. K.|last3=Margulis|first3= E. H.|title=Bimusicalism: The Implicit Dual Enculturation of Cognitive and Affective Systems|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Article|year=2009|volume=27|doi=10.1525/MP.2009.27.2.81|pages=81–88|pmc=2907111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted with participants familiar with Western, Indian, and both Western and Indian music, the bimusical participants (exposed to both Indian and Western styles) showed no [[bias]] for either music style in recognition tasks and did not indicate that one style of music was more tense than the other. In contrast, the Western and Indian participants more successfully recognized music from their own culture and felt the other culture's music was more tense on the whole. These results indicate that everyday exposure to music from both cultures can result in cognitive sensitivity to music styles from those cultures.&lt;ref name="Wong 2009"/&gt;

[[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] typically confers specific preferences for the language of [[lyrics]] in a song.&lt;ref name="Abril"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abril|first=C.|last2=Flowers|first2= P.|title=Attention, preference, and identity in music listening by middle school students of different linguistic backgrounds|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|pages=204–219|date=October 2007|volume=55|number=3|doi=10.1177/002242940705500303}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[monolingualism|monolingual]] ([[England|English]]-speaking) and bilingual ([[Spain|Spanish]]- and English-speaking) sixth graders listened to the same song played in an instrumental, English, or Spanish version, ratings of preference showed that bilingual students preferred the Spanish version, while monolingual students more often preferred the instrumental version; the children's self-reported distraction was the same for all excerpts. Spanish (bilingual) speakers also identified most closely with the Spanish song.&lt;ref name="Abril"/&gt; Thus, the language of lyrics interacts with a listener's culture and language abilities to affect preferences.

== Emotion recognition ==
The cue-redundancy model of emotion recognition in music differentiates between universal, structural auditory cues and culturally bound, learned auditory cues (see schematic below).&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"/&gt;

=== Psychophysical cues ===
Structural cues that span all musical traditions include dimensions such as pace (tempo), [[dynamics (music)|loudness]], and [[timbre]].&lt;ref name="Kwoun 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwoun|first=S.|title=An examination of cue redundancy theory in cross-cultural decoding of emotions in music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2009|volume=46|pages=217–237|doi=10.1093/jmt/46.3.217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fast tempo, for example, is typically associated with happiness, regardless of a listener's cultural background.

=== Culturally bound cues ===
Culture-specific cues rely on knowledge of the conventions in a particular musical tradition.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt; A particular timbre may be interpreted to reflect one emotion by Western listeners and another emotion by Eastern listeners.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balkwill 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balkwill|first=L.|last2=Thompson|first2= W.

=== Cue-redundancy model ===
[[Image:Cue-Redundancy Model.png|right|250px|thumb|Schematic of the cue-redundancy model.]]According to the cue-redundancy model, individuals exposed to music from their own cultural tradition utilize both psychophysical and culturally bound cues in identifying emotionality.&lt;ref name="Kwoun 2009"/&gt; Conversely, perception of intended emotion in unfamiliar music relies solely on universal, psychophysical properties.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt; [[japanese people|Japanese]] listeners accurately categorize angry, joyful, and happy musical excerpts from familiar traditions (Japanese and Western samples) and relatively unfamiliar traditions (Hindustani).&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt; Simple, fast [[melody|melodies]] receive joyful ratings from these participants; simple, slow samples receive sad ratings, and loud, complex excerpts are perceived as angry.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt; Strong relationships between emotional judgments and structural acoustic cues suggest the importance of universal musical properties in categorizing unfamiliar music.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"/&gt;

When both [[koreans|Korean]] and [[americans|American]] participants judged the intended emotion of Korean [[folksong]]s, the American group’s identification of happy and sad songs was equivalent to levels observed for Korean listeners.&lt;ref name="Kwoun 2009"/&gt; Surprisingly, Americans exhibited greater accuracy in anger assessments than the Korean group. The latter result implies cultural differences in anger [[perception]] occur independently of familiarity, while the similarity of American and Korean happy and sad judgments indicates the role of universal [[Hearing (sense)|auditory cues]] in emotional perception.&lt;ref name="Kwoun 2009"/&gt;

Categorization of unfamiliar music varies with intended emotion.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balkwill 1999"/&gt; Timbre mediates Western listeners’ recognition of angry and peaceful Hindustani songs.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 1999"/&gt; [[Flute]] timbre supports the detection of peace, whereas [[String instrument|string]] timbre aids anger identification. Happy and sad assessments, on the other hand, rely primarily on relatively “low-level” structural information such as [[tempo]]. Both low-level cues (e.g., slow tempo) and timbre aid in the detection of peaceful music, but only timbre cued anger recognition.&lt;ref name="Balkwill 1999"/&gt; Communication of peace, therefore, takes place at multiple structural levels, while anger seems to be conveyed nearly exclusively by timbre. Similarities between aggressive vocalizations and angry music (e.g., roughness) may contribute to the salience of timbre in anger assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Chen-Gia|first2=Li-Ching|last2=Wang|first3=Shwu-Fen|last3=Wang|first4=Yio-Wha|last4=Shau|first5=Tzu-Yu|last5=Hsiao |author6=Wolfgang Auhagen|publisher=National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan: Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany |title=Aggressiveness of the growl-like timbre: Acoustic characteristics, musical implications, and biomechanical mechanisms|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal |year=2010 |volume=27 |number=3 |doi=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.209 |pages=209–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stereotype Theory of Emotion in Music ===
The stereotype theory of emotion in music (STEM) suggests that cultural stereotyping may affect emotion perceived in music. STEM argues that for some listeners with low expertise, emotion perception in music is based on stereotyped associations held by the listener about the encoding culture of the music (i.e., the culture representative of a particular music genre, such as Brazilian culture encoded in Bossa Nova music).&lt;ref name="Susino &amp; Schubert 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|last2=Schubert|first2= E.|title=Cultural stereotyping of emotional responses to music genre|journal=Psychology of Music|year=2018||doi=10.1177/0305735618755886}}&lt;/ref&gt; STEM is an extension of the cue-redundancy model because in addition to arguing for two sources of emotion, some cultural cues can now be specifically explained in terms of stereotyping. Particularly, STEM provides more specific predictions, namely that emotion in music is dependent to some extent on the cultural stereotyping of the music genre being perceived.

=== Complexity ===
Because musical complexity is a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] dimension, the cue-redundancy model predicts that complexity is perceived independently of experience. However, South African and [[Finns|Finnish]] listeners assign different complexity ratings to identical [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] folk songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eerola|first=T.|last2=Himberg|first2= T.|last3=Toiviainen|first3= P.|last4=Louhivuori|first4= J.|title=Perceived complexity of western and African melodies by western and African listeners|journal=Psychology of Music|year=2006|volume=34|pages=337–371|doi=10.1177/0305735606064842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the cue-redundancy model may be overly simplistic in its distinctions between structural feature detection and cultural learning, at least in the case of complexity.

=== Repetition ===
When listening to music from within one’s own cultural tradition, repetition plays a key role in emotion judgments. American listeners who hear [[classical music|classical]] or [[jazz]] excerpts multiple times rate the elicited and conveyed emotion of the pieces as higher relative to participants who hear the pieces once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|last2=Peynircioglu|first2= Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2011|volume=27|pages=177–182|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methodological limitations ===
Methodological limitations of previous studies preclude a complete understanding of the roles of psychophysical cues in emotion recognition. Divergent [[musical mode|mode]] and [[pitch (music)|tone]] cues elicit “mixed affect,” demonstrating the potential for mixed emotional percepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|last2=Schellenberg|first2= G.|last3=Schimmack|first3= U.|title=Mixed affective responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=22|pages=327–352|doi=10.1080/02699930701438145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of dichotomous scales (e.g., simple happy/sad ratings) may mask this phenomenon, as these tasks require participants to report a single component of a multidimensional affective experience.

== Memory ==
Enculturation is a powerful influence on music memory. Both [[long-term memory|long-term]] and [[working memory]] systems are critically involved in the appreciation and comprehension of music. Long-term memory enables the listener to develop musical expectation based on previous experience while working memory is necessary to relate [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es to one another in a phrase, between phrases, and throughout a piece.&lt;ref name="Nan 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nan|first=Y.|last2=Knosche|first2= T. R.|last3=Zysset|first3= S.|last4=Friederici|first4= A. D.|title=Cross-cultural music phrase processing: An fMRI study|journal=Human Brain Mapping|year=2008|volume=29|pages=312–328|doi=10.1002/hbm.20390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscience ===
[[File:BrainLobesLabelled.jpg|right|thumb|180px|A diagram showing the locations of the lobes of the brain.]]
Neuroscientific evidence suggests that [[memory]] for music is, at least in part, special and distinct from other forms of memory.&lt;ref name="Schulkind 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulkind|first=M. D.|last2=DallaBella|first2= S.|last3=Kraus|first3= N.|last4=Overy|first4= K.|last5=Pantey|first5= C.|last6=Snyder|first6= J. S.|last7=Tervaniemi|first7= M.|last8=Tillman|first8= M.|last9=Schlaug|first9= G.|title=Is Memory for Music Special?|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2009|volume=1169|pages=216–224|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04546.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural processes of [[music information retrieval|music memory retrieval]] share much with the neural processes of [[verbal memory]] retrieval, as indicated by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] studies comparing the brain areas activated during each task.&lt;ref name="Groussard 2010"/&gt; Both musical and verbal memory retrieval activate the left inferior [[frontal cortex]], which is thought to be involved in executive function, especially executive function of verbal retrieval, and the posterior middle [[temporal cortex]], which is thought to be involved in semantic retrieval.&lt;ref name="Groussard 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirshorn 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirshorn|first=E. A.|last2=Thompson-Schill|first2= S. L.|title=Role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in covert word retrieval: Neural correlates of switching during verbal fluency|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2006|volume=44|issue=12|pages=2547–2557|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.035|pmid=16725162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=A.|last2=Chao|first2= L.

=== Effect of culture ===

==== Memory for music ====
[[Image:Gray726.png|right|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the locations of the brain's gyri.]]Despite the universality of music, [[enculturation]] has a pronounced effect on individuals' memory for music. Evidence suggests that people develop their [[cognitive]] understanding of music from their cultures.&lt;ref name="Demorest 2008"/&gt; People are best at recognizing and remembering music in the style of their native culture, and their music recognition and memory is better for music from familiar but nonnative cultures than it is for music from unfamiliar cultures.&lt;ref name="Demorest 2008"/&gt; Part of the difficulty in remembering culturally unfamiliar music may arise from the use of different neural processes when listening to familiar and unfamiliar music. For instance, brain areas involved in attention, including the right angular gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, show increased activity when listening to culturally unfamiliar music compared to novel but culturally familiar music.&lt;ref name="Nan 2008"/&gt;

==== Development ====
Enculturation affects music memory in early [[childhood]] before a child’s cognitive schemata for music is fully formed, perhaps beginning at as early as one year of age.&lt;ref name="Morrison 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=S. J.|last2=Demorest|first2= S. M.|last3=Stambaugh|first3= L. A.|title=Enculturation effects in music cognition: The role of age and music complexity|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|year=2008|volume=56|pages=118–129|doi=10.1177/0022429408322854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=S. J.|last2=Demorest|first2= S. M.|last3=Chiao|first3= J. Y.|title=Cultural constraints on music perception and cognition|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2009|volume=178|pages=67–77|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17805-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[adult]]s, children are also better able to remember novel music from their native culture than from unfamiliar ones, although they are less capable than adults at remembering more complex music.&lt;ref name="Morrison 2008"/&gt;

Children’s developing music cognition may be influenced by the language of their native culture.&lt;ref name="Trehub 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first=S. E.|last2=Schellenberg|first2= E. G.|last3=Nakata|first3= T.|title=Cross-cultural perspectives on pitch memory|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=2008|volume=100|issue=1|pages=40–52|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2008.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, children in English-speaking cultures develop the ability to identify pitches from familiar songs at 9 or 10 years old, while Japanese children develop the same ability at age 5 or 6.&lt;ref name="Trehub 2008"/&gt; This difference may be due to the Japanese language’s use of [[pitch accent]]s, which encourages better pitch discrimination at an early age, rather than the stress accents upon which English relies.&lt;ref name="Trehub 2008"/&gt;

==== Musical expectations ====
Enculturation also biases listeners' expectations such that they expect to hear tones that correspond to culturally familiar [[musical mode|modal]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Curtis 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=M. E.|last2=Bharucha|first2= J. J.|title=Memory and musical expectation for tones in cultural context|journal=Music Perception|year=2009|volume=26|issue=4|pages=365–375|doi=10.1525/MP.2009.26.4.365}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Western participants presented with a series of pitches followed by a test tone not present in the original series were more likely to mistakenly indicate that the test tone was originally present if the tone was derived from a Western [[musical scale|scale]] than if it was derived from a culturally unfamiliar scale.&lt;ref name="Curtis 2009"/&gt; Recent research indicates that deviations from expectations in music may prompt out-group derogation.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, Van Tilburg &amp; Van den Tol, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limits of enculturation ===
Despite the powerful effects of music enculturation, evidence indicates that cognitive comprehension of and affinity for different cultural modalities is somewhat plastic. One long-term instance of plasticity is bimusicalism, a musical phenomenon akin to bilingualism. Bimusical individuals frequently listen to music from two cultures and do not demonstrate the biases in [[recognition memory]] and [[perception]]s of tension displayed by individuals whose listening experience is limited to one musical tradition.&lt;ref name="Wong 2009"/&gt;

Other evidence suggests that some changes in music appreciation and comprehension can occur over a short period of time. For instance, after half an hour of passive exposure to original [[melody|melodies]] using familiar Western pitches in an unfamiliar [[chord progression|musical grammar]] or harmonic structure (the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]]), Western participants demonstrated increased recognition memory and greater affinity for melodies in this grammar.&lt;ref name="Loui 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loui|first=P.|last2=Wessel|first2= D. L.|last3=Kam|first3= C. L. H.|title=Humans rapidly learn grammatical structure in a new musical scale|journal=Music Perception|year=2010|volume=27|issue=5|pages=377–388|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.5.377|pmc=2927013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that even very brief exposure to unfamiliar music can rapidly affect music perception and memory.

In [[process theology]] '''dipolar theism''' is the position that in order to conceive a perfect God, one must conceive Him as embodying the "good" in sometimes-opposing characteristics, and therefore cannot be understood to embody only one set of characteristics.

For instance, here are some characteristics commonly associated with God:
:One — Many
:Transcendent — Immanent
:Eternal — Temporal
:Mutable — Immutable
:Merciful — Just
:Simple — Complex

Dipolar theism holds that in each pair, both of the characteristics contain some element of good.  In order to embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in ''both'' characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other.

For instance, there is a "good" in being just, and also a good in being merciful.  In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished.  In being merciful, God forgives those who sin.  It follows, therefore, that a God that was ''only'' just or ''only'' merciful would be less than perfect.  Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in ''both'' of those characteristics.  Thus, a perfect God has the "good" characteristics of justice ''and'' the good characteristics of mercy.

Alternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion.  For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by [[predestination]], because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion.  God must therefore embody the "good" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an [[omnipotent]] God.

==Critique of dipolar theism==
Those rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we ''think'' God is and what God ''actually'' is.  Just because we think God should be a certain way in order to embody our idea of perfection does not mean he embodies those characteristics in reality.  

This critique is analogous to the critique of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]] by [[Gaunilo]]: "Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists.  Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be."

'''''Earth &amp; Sky''''', also known as '''''EarthSky''''' (the still-active website), was a daily radio series that presented information about [[science]] and [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.EarthSky.org EarthSky.]'' [http://earthsky.org/earthsky-a-clear-voice-for-science Earthsky: A clear voice for science] Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It began broadcasting in 1991. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was the creation of producers [[Deborah Byrd]] and Joel Block, who were also the hosts.  They previously hosted the program [[StarDate (radio program)|Star Date]] that began broadcasting in the US in 1977.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' presented 60- and 90-second radio spots (called "modules") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial [[radio]] as well as [[satellite radio]] and [[internet radio]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.Podfeed.net Podfeed.net].''  http://www.podfeed.net/podcast/Earth++Sky+radio+show/2730  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and other [[public radio]] stations, 80 affiliate stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EarthSky.org ''EarthSky''.] http://earthsky.org/partners/offerings  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, the programming iwas heard on American Forces Radio, [[Voice of America]] Radio, [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]], and others.

The information on ''Earth &amp; Sky'' came directly from scientists. The [[journalist]]s who produced the ''Earth &amp; Sky'' radio program and continue to produce the Website speak to several scientists each day, dozens each week and hundreds each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 scientists had joined ''Earth &amp; Sky'' as volunteer advisers. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' science advisers suggested content, gave feedback, recommended other experts, and reviewed scripts for accuracy before they were recorded for broadcast.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' featured many fields of science. In 2006, it focused was on [[nanotechnology]], [[women in science]], [[List of Earth observation satellites|observing the Earth]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Space science|space]], and the human world.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode of ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was broadcast on June 2, 2013. President and co-founder Deborah Byrd said that although funding options existed to continue the radio program, a decision was made to stop producing the radio show in order to concentrate on the Website and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Brandon|title=Silent Nignt: EarthSky says goodbye to radio|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2013-03-04/silent-night/|accessdate=16 July 2014|work=The Austin Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">'''Eikos, Inc''' is a [[technology]] [[company]] based in [[Franklin, Massachusetts]] that is developing transparent, electrically conductive [[carbon nanotube]] films and nanotube inks for transparent conductive coatings. Eikos has branded its technology as Invisicon. It was founded in 1996 by [[Joseph Piche]]. 

Eikos is aiming to replace [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO) and conducting polymers with carbon nanotube transparent conductors in several common electronic devices, such as [[touch screens]], [[LCD]]s, [[OLED]]s, [[photovoltaics]], [[electroluminescent lamp]]s, [[electronic paper]]. Nanotube films have several advantages over ITO, which make them attractive in these markets. For example, nanotube films are exceptionally flexible and can be deposited using low cost, atmospheric coating methods.

'''Elitism''' is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an [[elite]] — a select group of people with a certain [[ancestry]], intrinsic [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], high [[intellect]], [[wealth]], special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term ''elitism'' often refers to the concentration of power in the [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast Corridor]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where the typical American elite resides – journalists, lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants, businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs, and financial advisors in the [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary sector]], often in established technological or political catchments of their [[higher education]] [[alma mater]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Alternatively, the term ''elitism'' may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include [[anti-elitism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[populism]] and [[political theory]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].

[[Elite theory]] is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal. Elitism is closely related to [[social class]] and what [[sociologist]]s call [[social stratification]], which in the [[Anglo Saxon]] tradition have long been anchored in the "blue blood" claims of hereditary [[nobility]]. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term ''elitism'' is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an [[in-group]] or [[En cadre|cadre]] grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as ''[[discrimination]]''.

==Characteristics==
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status ''can'' be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term, "elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as [[meritocracy]], [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[plutocracy]] as opposed to radical [[democracy]], political [[egalitarianism]] and [[populism]]. Elitists also believe only a few "shakers and movers" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite (elitist) theory|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/elite_theory|website=auburn.edu|publisher=Auburn University|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[synonym]]s for "elite" might be "upper-class" or "[[aristocracy|aristocratic]]", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's [[means of production]]. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.

===Academic elitism===
{{anchor|Academic}}
{{see also|Ivory tower}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Elitism in the context of [[education]] is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those [[student]]s who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or one that is hard to enter.

==Anti-elitism&lt;!--'Antielitism' and 'Antielitism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{main|Populism|Pluralism (political theory)}}
The term ''elitism'' and the [[pejorative]] title ''elitist'' are sometimes used by people who are not (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the "[[average Joe]]". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. The definition of ''elitist'' is similar to that of the word "[[snob]]".

An elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege.

An early proponent of '''anti-elitism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology'', Routledge, 2010, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarianism===
{{further|Egalitarianism}}
Elitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, [[populism]], [[socialism]], or [[communism]]. They may also support [[affirmative action]], [[social security]], [[luxury tax]]es, and highly [[progressive tax]]es for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-[[meritocracy|meritocratic]] in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.

The terms ''elitism'' and ''meritocracy'' are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|date=January 2008|volume=29|issue=7–27|pages=7|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centre Etude Polymorphisme Humain Institut Genetique Moleculaire Paris France.jpg|thumb|200px|CEPH]]
The '''Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH''' or '''CEPH''', formerly the '''Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain''' (the ''Center for the Study of Human [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Human Molecular Genetics: Mechanisms of Inherited Diseases|author=Jack J. Pasternak|publisher=Wiley|date=2005|ISBN=9780471719175}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an international genetic research center located in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It produced a map that includes genetic markers of human [[chromosomes]] using a resource of [[biological immortality|immortalised]] cell cultures.

==Background==
In his 2005 addendum to his biography for the 1980 [[Nobel Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1980/dausset-bio.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Dausset]] noted that, thanks to his Nobel Prize and a grant from the French Téléthon, he had been able in 1984 to create the Human Polymorphism Study Centre (CEPH), which soon after became Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH. Dausset founded CEPH with the collaboration of Professors Howard Cann and Daniel Cohen.

The scientific director of CEPH is currently [[Jean-François Deleuze]] and its president is [[François d'Aubert]], a French politician, an auditor at the Cour des Comptes and a former minister delegate to research.

==Human genome==
Numerous collaborators working on the same large families as Dausset had collected for his Nobel Prize-winning studies on the [[human leukocyte antigen]] system, led to the addition of numerous gene markers and made it feasible to publish the first [[genetic map]] and, later on, the first [[physical map]] of the [[human genome]].

==New resources==
An exhaustive study of human populations around the world has also produced important publications from CEPH. Besides this, DNA samples from [[sibship]]s of people over 95 years old and a bank of [[centenarian]]s now provide a valuable research resource at the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''''GB84''''' is a novel published in 2004 by [[David Peace]], set during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984-85 miners' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;The Observer, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/29/fiction.features3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel is largely based on factual events and follows two main characters: Terry Winters (based on [[Roger Windsor]]),&lt;ref&gt;Red Pepper, http://www.redpepper.org.uk/No-redemption/&lt;/ref&gt; chief executive of the National Union of Mineworkers; and Stephen Sweet (based on [[David Hart (UK political activist)|David Hart]]), an advisor to the Thatcher government.

The novel refers to contemporary events including the murder of [[Hilda Murrell]], the [[Battle of Orgreave]], the involvement of the police and [[MI5]], and the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)#NUM links with Libya and the Soviet Union|NUM's links with the Soviet Union and Libya]].

==Structure and style==
Each chapter begins with "day by day" accounts from two striking miners, Martin and Peter, written in short conversational sentences. The rest of each chapter is written in a more standard style.

==Reception==
The book was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for literature in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41347">'''Gender policing''' is the imposition or enforcement of [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender expression]]s on an individual who is perceived as [[gender variance|not adequately performing]], through appearance or behavior, the [[assigned sex|sex that was assigned to them at birth]] (see [[gender performativity]]). Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the [[gender binary]]. According to [[Judith Butler]], rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Butler|url=http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf|editor=Laura J. Nicholson|title=Gender Trouble Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|publisher=Routledge|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender mainstreaming]] is a [[public policy]] concept, whereas gender policing is a more general [[social phenomenon]].

It is common for normative gender performances of gender to be encouraged and rewarded, while non-normative performances are discouraged through punishment or generally negative reactions. Policing of non-normative performances ranges in intensity from relatively minor discouraging comments to brutal acts of violence. Tactics of gender policing also vary widely, depending in part on the perceived gender of the individual target.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|title=The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays - Assault On Gay America |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heteronormativity and the gender binary==

Gender policing aims to keep gender roles rigid and aligned according to the [[gender binary]]. The gender binary is the idea that gender exists as the opposition between man and woman. [[Heteronormativity]], as an institution, is an extension of this belief that posits that gender and sexuality are expressions of biology. This functionalism of biology asserts that male and female genitalia only serve the purpose of procreation, which creates gender roles that manifest from a perceived innate desire, giving sexuality a specific purpose within society.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Gayle Rubin]]'s writing in "The Traffic in Women" links the creation of the gender binary to the subordination of women in western society. Rubin studied the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Levi Strauss]] to gain a better understanding of the creation of the "sex/gender system". Rubin found that "woman" was a role created in opposition to "man" and served the purpose of building power, trade relationships, and mutual aid through the exchange of women by marriage. These [[Kinship]] systems necessitated rules, which had to be policed to ensure their continued survival. These rules crystalized into heteronormativity, culturally instilling the rules for accepted sexuality in western society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/the-rraffic-in-women.pdf|contribution=The Traffic in Women|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender binary in western society was formalized from the interpretations of men and women during the [[hunter-gatherer]] ages. During this [[Mesolithic]] or Middle Stone Age in North-West Europe, hunting and gathering food was a prominent survival strategy. Early interpretations of these survival techniques is one of the main reasons for the current idea of the gender binary within western society. In his review of the ethnography of gathering shellfish, Clive Bonsall incorrectly presumed that women and children were primarily gatherers and men were the hunters do to their stronger skill set. These assumptions of past societies shaped the current structure of western society into the beliefs that men are the providers and women are the supporters. Additionally in the idea of heterosexual marriage as the societal norm came from the analysis of the interactions between different Mesolithic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Hannah|date=2005|title=Straight down the line? A queer consideration of hunter-gatherer studies in north-west Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240500395862|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=630–636|doi=10.1080/00438240500395862|issn=0043-8243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mentality that strengthens the idea of binary gender within western society is the warrior-breeder relationship. In this mentality, masculinity is characterized by the traits of the model warrior: strong and fearless, yet disposable. Meanwhile, femininity and womanhood revolve around reproduction. In this relationship, there are only two types of people; therefore, two genders. This dichotomy is valued because it keeps society safe in times of war. The warriors fight and protect while the breeders replace the fallen warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=6. Gender Terrorism, Gender Sacrifice Getting beyond Zero-Sum Heterosexuality|date=2014-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/digb16840-007|work=Love and War|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231538404|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the works of LGB activism during the late 1980’s to 1990’s, the [[queer theory]] was created along with the influential work of Foucault and Sedgewick. The queer theory creates a space outside the gender binary. This theory deconstructs and discredits the idea of a gender binary. Disregarding the gender binary caused fears within the western society, ultimately leading to gender policing in order to maintain the idea of binary gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt183q5wt|title=Gender Politics|last=Monro|first=Surya|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9781849644952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man and woman as categories can not exist without the other to enforce what they are and are not. The same can be said of heterosexuality and homosexuality. These categories are created out of their opposition, forming power dynamics. [[Michel Foucault]] referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spargo, Tamsin. Post Modern Encounters Foucault and Queer Theory. New York: Totem, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity==

[[Patriarchy|Patriarchal]] societies perpetuate masculine dominance in all aspects of life. Patriarchy privileges masculine thought and expression creating a gender hierarchy where women and the feminine are subordinated. The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] describes a hierarchy even within masculinity itself. Hegemonic masculinity allows for the terms and expression of masculinity to be renegotiated according to time, culture, and class status, allowing for the rationalization of its continued dominance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist, [[Raewyn Connell]] created the theory of hegemonic masculinity in order to explain the relationships between men and women and between the class of men within a patriarchal system. This theory is based on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony –– conformity or subordination of one group which creates class-based domination. Connell’s theory explains the ways in which ideal or normalized masculine traits have the highest values in western society. These masculine attributes include wealth, control over resources, fertility, attractiveness, heterosexuality, physical strength, and emotional detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400842629|title=The New Arab Man|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2012-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400842629|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrakis Z. Demetriou further divided hegemonic masculinity into two types: external and internal. External hegemonic masculinity refers to the subordination of women under men. Internal hegemonic masculinity is the spectrum of masculinity seen within men. This spectrum is defined by the amount of power and masculinity a man holds. The patriarchy needs hegemonic masculinity in order to maintain power. In order to keep this power, men must be policed and women must me dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=R. W.|last2=Messerschmidt|first2=James W.|date=2005|title=Hegemonic Masculinity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=6|pages=829–859|doi=10.1177/0891243205278639|issn=0891-2432|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ideal form of masculinity is seen by patriarchal power, men that fit in this norm are seen as what a human should embody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemon|first=Jennifer|date=1995|title=Masculinity in Crisis?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4065897|journal=Agenda|issue=24|pages=61|doi=10.2307/4065897|issn=1013-0950}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gender hierarchy created by patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity creates competition for dominance resulting in the policing of gender and sexuality. Policing of masculinity in a heteronormative society reinforces the gender binary. Individuals seeking to reaffirm their position in a masculine hierarchy seek out and police individuals performing inadequately. Those performing inadequately must either conform to the accepted forms of gender and sexual expression or risk violence and ostracism.&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

Fathers are more likely than mothers to enforce gender boundaries, or police the gendered expressions of their children. Second, both fathers and mothers enforce gender boundaries more frequently with sons than with daughters.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Research on the topic of parental gender policing has shown that female children who display traditionally masculine traits or behaviors receive more social and parental acceptance than male children who exhibit traditionally feminine tendencies.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many scholars on the subject argue that this is due to the greater value assigned to "masculine" traits or behaviors compared to "feminine" ones, and/or beliefs that "tomboyism" is temporary.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At least one study indicates that parents across various social locations celebrate and encourage their preschool age daughters to engage in gender nonconformity, such as wearing sports-themed clothing and participating in traditionally male activities.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; However, other research indicates that in part due to peer and parental pressures, "tomboys", or female children with "masculine" traits or behavioral tendencies, frequently either abandon these tendencies in adolescence, or adopt a more feminine performance but retain many masculine skills and traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pressures to conform to gender norms increase with age, and often manifest in these children being "instructed or shamed to conform to traditional femininity – in dress, appearance, posture, manner, interests, and dating."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fields of knowledge that claim to be universal are still created within societal frameworks that have their own rules and biases. A patriarchal society gives privilege to masculine thought and excludes other points of view and histories. All discourse created in a patriarchal society can be said to acquiesce to hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Michel Foucault viewed [[Psychoanalysis]] as a secular confession concerned with finding our natural sexual selves. The problem, Foucault argued, is that sexuality is cultural and any narrative created around it gives the subject the illusion of identity rather than experience. Psychoanalysis conducted in a hetero-normative society would view any deviation as a failing to achieve that ideal. Rather than someone being seen as performing an act, they would be seen as embodying that which society deemed inadequate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Gayle Rubin wrote about Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory in "The Traffic In Women". Rubin states that [[Jacques Lacan]]'s analysis of Freud views the [[Oedipus complex]] as the crisis experienced by a child when internalizing kinship rules. The child becomes aware of the sex/gender system and organizes itself accordingly. [[Neurosis]] is seen as having an understanding of this system yet failing to adapt to it. Lacan's separation of the [[Phallus]] from the physical penis elucidates societies privileging of the masculine and gender's separation from biology. In Rubin's view psychiatry further policed accepted gender and sexual expression by deeming non normative behavior as mentally and emotionally stunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf|title=Thinking Sex|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also saw that this system of internalizing norms privileged heterosexual masculinity while outlining the psychic oppression society inflicts on women and femininity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Intersectionality ==

Gender policing affects different social identifications in different ways. Along with gender, characteristic attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender identity]], [[Social class|class]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, [[creed]], and disability interact with each other and are affected differently by gender policing. The effect of intersection of these social categories are studied in [[intersectionality]] theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Understanding intersectionality within gender policing can be done by tracing back and analyzing the relation between race and gender in history. Race and gender over time produced hierarchies within themselves. Similar to the way the classification of "man" cannot exist without "woman", "white" people cannot exist without "black" people. Race as a classification arose from European capitalist colonialism. European colonists deemed those who weren't "white", primitive and deserving of domination and "civilizing". Global colonialism by European capitalists imposed European ways of knowing and being on the peoples they colonized. This included a racialized and patriarchal conception of gender. The view of colonized peoples as primitive created a distinction between "white" (human) and "black" (property or inhuman). The view of "black" as other than human excluded "black" people from classifications of gender. In western society, being "white" and middle class continue to inform gender norms, leaving "non-white" people unable to perform accepted [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]].

In modern day times, intersectionality now touches upon various other forms of human characterizations, affecting people in countless different ways. How a white transgender woman may experience gender policing is going to differ greatly from how an asian heterosexual woman might (etc). 

==Socialization==

An individual's expression of gender is often first policed by their parent(s), as well as other elder authorities such as teachers and day care providers, at a very young age. Gender policing is part of the process of "gendering" children, or socializing them in a way considered conventionally appropriate to their assigned sex. Once children are taught gender norms and experience their enforcement, they are likely to begin policing others – both their peers and their elders.

=== Early Childhood ===
Gender policing begins with gender enforcing from parents teaching their children what is "masculine" and what is "feminine" in the traditional sense of these terms. These traditional ideas of gender are reinforced through practices such as referring to children as "boys" and "girls" which "makes sex/ gender the central component of how kids think of themselves, understand their social group, and view themselves through their parents’ eyes."&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd98k|title=Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Demeter Press|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Fiona Joy|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Friedman|editor-first2=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jane Ward, professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside, writes in her chapter of the book ''Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices'', even parents who hope to redefine "boyhood" or "girlhood" (such as through allowing a "tomboy" daughter, or dressing a son in dresses, for example), still reinforce the concept of gender as a binary which is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; The gender binary is already enforced in obvious places, such as in the segregation of toys in stores, for example.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Ethnographic research in preschools has also contributed to the body of knowledge related to gender policing. This research has suggested that teachers give their students gendered instructions about what to do with their bodies. Across several schools, teachers gave boys explicit bodily instructions more frequently than girls, indicating that boys' bodies are policed more often than girls'.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, K. 1998. Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools. ''American Sociological Review'', 63(4), 494-511.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be because teachers were more forceful with their instructions to girls, who were also usually quicker to follow instructions, thus teachers did not need to repeat themselves as often. Teachers were also more likely to direct boys to cease behaviors (e.g. running, throwing objects), whereas they were more apt to instruct girls to alter them. For example, girls were given directive bodily instructions such as "talk to her, don't yell, sit here, pick that up, be careful, be gentle, give it to me, put it down there."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; As a result, a wider range of potential activities is available to boys than girls, because although they are dissuaded from some, they are not directed to engage in specific activities as often as girls are. According to Martin, the scholar and sociologist who conducted this research, "Gendering of the body in childhood is the foundation on which further gendering of the body occurs throughout the life course. The gendering of children's bodies makes gender differences feel and appear natural, which allows for such bodily differences to emerge throughout the life course."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

Relatively recent efforts have been made to limit gender policing, particularly in childhood. Sweden's reformation of their school system in 1962 resulted in a new curriculum which included objectives to limit gender policing in early education. Within this new curriculum it was determined that "Pre-schools should work to counteract traditional gender and gender roles. Girls and boys in pre-schools should have the same opportunities to try and develop their abilities and interests without being limited by stereotyped gender roles." &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayne|first=Emma|date=|title=Gender Pedagogy in Swedish Pre-Schools: An Overview|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-009-9076-x#citeas|journal=Springer Link|volume=Vol. 26|pages=130-140|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preschools, elementary, and secondary schools aim to reduce the gender policing placed onto children, but through doing this must show how teachers and other pedagogical adults may accidentally reinforce gender stereotypes. Tools teachers use to combat this include practices such as keeping journals and videotaping classroom interactions (a practice proposed by Susanne Rithander). A general pedagogical practice in these Swedish schools in called ''compensatory pedagogy'', which plays off the idea that, per traditional gender roles, boys are encouraged to maintain autonomy while girls are encouraged to maintain closeness with others. ''Compensatory pedagogy'' challenges these traditional gender roles by encouraging girls to maintain autonomy and boys to build closeness with others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Some parents have attempted to limit gender policing through their parenting styles, as is the case with Storm's parents, who chose no to gender their child but instead to wait until their child could decide for his/herself. Unlike the relative success so far of Swedish schools in limiting gender policing, individual efforts by Kathy and David, Storm's parents, faced huge media backlash. In the chapter titled ''Get Your Gender Binary Off My Childhood!: Towards a Movement for Childrenʹs Gender Self-Determination'', Ward shows how Storm's parents were often called deceitful and manipulative, as Ward puts it, "For not revealing what they knew about Storm’s genitals, Kathy and David were accused of hiding Storm’s very selfhood." &lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is a developmental stage in which [[peer group]]s are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It is also a stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative gender expressions and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.

''[[Dude, You're a Fag]]'', a book by [[CJ Pascoe]], examines [[masculinity]] and gender policing in high schools through [[ethnographic]] research. Pascoe largely focuses on high school boys' use of the [[Faggot (slang)|fag]] [[epithet]] to establish their own masculinity by questioning or challenging others'. In this context, the use of the fag epithet is a form of gender policing, frequently applied to boys who lack heterosexual prowess or are deemed inadequately masculine or strong. According to Pascoe, "[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dude You're A Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007), by C.J. Pascoe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of male students of a co-educational, Catholic high school demonstrates insights from adolescent males themselves in regard to gender policing. This study highlights the gender policing of males by each other through exploring the types of bullying being practiced. Forms of bullying (and gender policing) come from accusations of males being homosexual. One participant in the study explains that he was bullied for dancing ballet and described his bullying as "Just a lot to do with being a woman", thus showing an association of specific activities with a specific gender (and that deviance from typical gender roles proves a perceived grounds for bullying). &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Wayne|date=2000-01-01|title=Policing Masculinities: Investigating the Role of Homophobia and Heteronormativity in the Lives of Adolescent School Boys|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3149/jms.0802.213|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=213–236|doi=10.3149/jms.0802.213|issn=1060-8265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the practice of conducting interviews, the study briefly explores an observed policing of male behavior by females. One interviewee "appears to be drawing attention to the different norms for governing the conduct of girls who police boys’ bullying practices through a condemnation of violent behaviors".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interviewees also draw attention to the confirmation and reinforcement of attitudes and practices considered "masculine" within males. In addition, these "masculine" identifiers are further enforced through female interaction and confirmation. In conducting these interviews, it is also found how adolescents view the stereotypical concept of masculinity as a concept which is ingrained early on in their lives and “passed on from their fathers".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, gender policing generally becomes more subtle. However, for an individual whose gender is perceived as ambiguous, blatant forms still exist. These range from curious inquiries by children (e.g. "Are you a boy or a girl?") to gender policing in bathrooms (discussed in the following section). People who are gender-normative in appearance experience primarily behavioral gender policing, such as reminders to act in a more (or less) feminine or masculine manner. Men are more often dissuaded and shamed for feminine behavior than women are for masculine behavior. It is theorized that this is due, at least in part, to the higher societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kane, E.|year=2006|title=No Way My Boys Are Going to be like That!" Parents' Responses to Children's Gender Nonconformity|journal=Gender and Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, C. L.|year=1998|title=Tomboy Resistance and Conformity: Agency in Social Psychological Gender Theory|journal=Gender and Society|volume=12|issue=5|pages=528–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender policing has been reinforced in adults for many years. As [[Angela Davis|Angela Y. Davis]] points out, early women's prisons relied on gender policing as a means of reformation. The first women's reformatory in the U.S. opened in Indiana and included areas designed as kitchens, living rooms, and nurseries. The idea was to train women about domesticity through activities such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Are Prisons Obsolete?|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Publishers Group Canada|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58322-581-3|location=Toronto, ON|pages=60-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex verification in sports|Sex testing]] and verification in sports and athletics shows gender policing as a practice still relevant to many countries and athletic organizations in recent history. In the case of the nineteen-year-old Missouri runner Helen Stephens in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]], who finished first place in the 100-meter race, many questioned her sex because they could not fathom a the concept of a woman running so quickly. Sex testing and verification has existed throughout human history, even being traced back to practices in ancient Greek contests. Within these Greek traditions, women were deterred from participation and even spectatorship at times. In the examples of both Greek practices and the story of Helen Stephens of Missouri, it can be seen how women are often more likely to be subject to sex verification processes and accusations of deceit (i.e. women are often accused of actually being men disguised as women; men are not often accused of being women disguised as men).&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf|title=Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women's Sports|last=PIEPER|first=LINDSAY PARKS|date=2016|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252040221|doi=10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf.5#metadata_info_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals==
The severity of gender policing is often proportional to the extremity of non-normativity. For example, [[transgender]] individuals are likely to be victims of the most extreme and violent forms of gender policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incite-national.org/sites/default/files/incite_files/resource_docs/3515_toolkitrev-policinggender.pdf|title=Policing Gender|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research regarding conformity pressures and gender resistance among [[transfeminine]] individuals (those who are assigned the male sex at birth but identify as more feminine than masculine) indicates that these persons experienced "intense and pervasive" pressures to conform to traditional masculinity, and feared exposure of their gender identity would result in physical danger or loss of legal, economic, or social standing.&lt;ref name="Gagne"&gt;Gagné, P., &amp; Tewksbury, R. 1998. Conformity Pressures and Gender Resistance among Transgendered Individuals. ''Social Problems'', 45(1), 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transgender individuals must often choose between self-preservation and expressing their self-identified gender.&lt;ref name="Gagne" /&gt;

Gender policing is especially prevalent in bathrooms due to the increased salience of gender in explicitly gendered environments (and the forced binary of "men" and "women").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/09/02/guest-post-go-where-sex-gender-and-toilets/|title=Go Where? Sex, Gender, and Toilets - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this issue is frequently encountered by transgender and [[genderqueer]] individuals, to a lesser extent, it is also experienced by persons with [[androgynous]] or gender ambiguous appearances. For individuals with non-normative gender identities, the choice of which bathroom to use is often laden with "anxiety, ambivalence, and anticipated harassment."&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance"&gt;Embodied Resistance: Challenging the Norms, Breaking the Rules (2011), edited by C. Bobel and S. Kwan.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for gender-normative people to alert security of the presence of transgender (or androgynous) individuals in a bathroom, regardless of whether the bathroom they are using conforms to their sex or to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance" /&gt; According to [[Judith Halberstam|Jack Halberstam]], the main distinction between gender policing in the women's room and in the men's room is that in the former, not only trans women, but all gender ambiguous females are scrutinized, whereas in the latter, biological males are less frequently deemed out of place.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity"&gt;Female Masculinity (1998), by Judith Halberstam.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to trans women in the women's room, trans men in the men's room are likely to be less scrutinized because men are less vigilant about intruders than women.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; However, a trans man in the men's room is more likely to be met with violence if he does not succeed in [[Passing (sociology)|passing]].&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; 

Transwomen and transmen are “six times more likely to experience discrimination” than non-trans people.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender-Baird|first=Kyla|date=2015-09|title=Peeing under surveillance: bathrooms, gender policing, and hate violence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0966369X.2015.1073699?needAccess=true&amp;|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=7|pages=983–988|doi=10.1080/0966369x.2015.1073699|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 incidents of anti-LGBT hate crimes were reported to the [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] in 2013. In 2014, there was a national study of trans violence discovered with the results of  “53% of respondents reporting verbal assault and 8% physical assault in a place of public accommodation”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. As a site where gender norms are policed, bathrooms are the most common public accommodation where trans people and gender non-conforming people experience hate violence. People tend to believe that there is a connection between genitals and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2013-09-24|title=Doing Gender, Determining Gender|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243213503203|journal=Gender &amp; Society|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=32–57|doi=10.1177/0891243213503203|issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the gender segregation of bathrooms is based on genital configuration. Because of this “match” between genitals and gender, trans people often are labeled as “deceivers” and blamed for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathers|first=Lain A. B.|date=2017-04-03|title=Bathrooms, Boundaries, and Emotional Burdens: Cisgendering Interactions Through the Interpretation of Transgender Experience|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.295|journal=Symbolic Interaction|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1002/symb.295|issn=0195-6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a trans or androgynous person is questioned in the bathroom, the reaction is “not to reassess the arbitrary nature of segregating bathrooms by sex but to violently eject the trans or gender non-conforming person”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Using a public bathroom is no longer a simple matter for trans and gender non-conforming people. 

As of March 2017, 19 states (California, Nevada, Hawaii, New York, etc.), the District of Columbia and over 200 cities have enforced the anti-discrimination law toward transgender people allowing them to use any public restroom that corresponds to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most public accommodations changed their restroom signs where there are both genders and the text “Gender Neutral Restroom” or “Inclusive Restroom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/transgender-bathroom-law-facts-myths/index.html|title=3 myths in the transgender bathroom debate|last=CNN|first=Emanuella Grinberg and Dani Stewart,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was passed because of the March 2016 “[[Bathroom bill|Bathroom Bill]]” in North Carolina. The bill argued that banning people from using public restrooms of their choice due to the biological sex listed on their birth certificates (genitals vs. gender) was unreasonable, therefore, it launched transgender rights into the national spotlight. 

== Fashion and Modern Opposition of Gender Policing ==
In 1924, gender norms accepted and re enforced ideologies that shadowed Freud’s hegemonic thesis that “biology is the key determinant of gender identity”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3672297/future-gender-norms/|title=The Past, Present and Future of Gender Norms|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These norms were imbedded into cultural regularity, affecting gender identity in everyday life, law and politics. Gender policing strategies enforced these norms, and a prevalent tactic was to use culturally obligatory [[Dress code|dress codes]] as a tool in forcing people into gender binaries. However progressive movements throughout history have worked vigorously to defy policing, combating restrictive norms through disregard and reformation of policed gender standards. Following of Freud’s theory has steadily begun to dwindle and new studies are beginning to reveal a popular uprising theory that individuals make their own decisions as to which gender distinguishments apply to them.  Modern opposition of gender norms are erasing the aged policing of conforming to the standards of one’s sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to a study by Intelligence Group, a consumer insights company, “More than two-thirds of people ages 14 to 34 agree that gender does not have to define a person in the way that it used to… and 6 in 10 say that men and women do not need to conform to traditional gender roles or behaviors anymore.” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style|title=For These Millennials, Gender Norms Have Gone Out Of Style|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Gender Policing Dress Codes ===
Older fashion protocols systematically enforced normative gender binaries, confining people to dress and accessorize in a way that connected to their sex. Society would use gender policing tactics to enforce cultural and societal acceptance of a gendered dress code. Women were to dress in a feminine style, while men had to style themselves in a masculine way. The way one dressed was meant to represent their sex and it’s stereotypes, “Circumstantial or societal norms dictate the outfits we choose to wear, often reflecting the expectations we are held to” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uresearch.unm.edu/breaking-gender-norms-through-fashion.pdf|title=Breaking Gender Norms through Fashion: Lessons from Georgia O’Keeffe|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its only recently that most [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary]] type laws, laws used to enforce “gender appropriate clothes” and arrest people who “impersonate” another gender, have been overturned. For example, “a person perceived as male who dressed in clothing customarily designed for women could technically be arrested in New York for “impersonating a female” as recently as 2011 — the remnants of a 19th century statewide law prohibiting wearing “the dress of the opposite sex.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/arresting-dress-timeline-anti-cross-dressing-laws-u-s|title=Arresting dress: A timeline of anti-cross-dressing laws in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cultural policing tactics such as slut shaming, [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]] are still used today to police fashion. There is still a long way to go for those pushing for the elimination of policed gendered dress codes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Using Fashion in Modern Opposition ====
This reformation campaign against gender policed conformity has found a focus in developing cultural acceptance for fluidity in modern cultural dress codes. Nowadays decisions on gender identity are seen as self made and a form of “self expression”. A prevalent way of expressing ones identity and not conforming to gender norms is through personal choice in style. These choices include apparel, accessories and beauty habits. Style has a “symbolic meaning” of self expression, “giving us a means to cultivate our own visions of the culture we experience around us”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. Therefor, fashion nonconformity has expansively become wonted and accepted by a rising number of millennials who believe in bending past policed gendered binaries. They do this by ignoring the outdated dress codes that were previously used to confine someone to their gender identity. In disregarding a dress code that has been used as a weapon in enforcing gender binary, millennials have found a powerful opposition to gender policing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;


Modern gender-specific fashion has become more flexible to personal preference, becoming visibly more directed against old gendered style constraints. The refusal to conform to the rules of outdated fashion protocol is being embraced by [[a la mode]] fashion and mainstream style. A recent pattern in clothing and accessories that transcend gender style norms has become steadily vogue and evidently pioneering fashion trends have increasingly grown accepting to the fusion of normally gender specific style details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/06/famous-women-who-have-worn-menswear#11|title=Famous Women Have Been Defying Gender Norms and Rocking Menswear for Years|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|date=|website=Vanities|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trendy nonconforming styles empower women to dress in an inclusively “masculine” manner and enable men to adapt “feminine” attributes in their style, for example women choosing to wear suits to work, or men wearing nail polish, etc. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

{{term|[[Chain rule]]}}
{{defn|The '''chain rule''' is a [[formula]] for computing the [[derivative]] of the [[Function composition|composition]] of two or more [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. That is, if ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition {{math|''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}} (the function which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')) ) in terms of the derivatives of ''f'' and ''g'' and the [[pointwise product|product of functions]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'=(f'\circ g)\cdot g'.&lt;/math&gt;

This may equivalently be expressed in terms of the variable. Let {{math|1=''F'' = ''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}}, or equivalently, {{math|1=''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} for all ''x''. Then one can also write
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The chain rule may be written in [[Leibniz's notation]] in the following way. If a variable ''z'' depends on the variable ''y'', which itself depends on the variable ''x'', so that ''y'' and ''z'' are therefore [[dependent variable]]s, then ''z'', via the intermediate variable of ''y'', depends on ''x'' as well.  The chain rule then states,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}. &lt;/math&gt;

The two versions of the chain rule are related; if &lt;math&gt;z=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=\frac{dz}{dy}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(y)g'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[integral|integration]], the counterpart to the chain rule is the [[substitution rule]].}}
{{term|[[Change of variables]]}}
{{defn| Is a basic technique used to simplify problems in which the original [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s are replaced with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of other variables.

{{term|[[Convergent series]]}}
{{defn|defn= In [[mathematics]], a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the terms of an [[infinite sequence]] of numbers.

Given an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;\left ( a_1,\ a_2,\ a_3,\dots \right )&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''th [[partial sum]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the first ''n'' terms of the sequence, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k.&lt;/math&gt;

A series is '''convergent''' if the sequence of its partial sums &lt;math&gt;\left \{ S_1,\ S_2,\ S_3,\dots \right \}&lt;/math&gt; tends to a [[limit of a sequence|limit]]; that means that the partial sums become closer and closer to a given number when the number of their terms increases. More precisely, a series converges, if there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; such that for any arbitrarily small positive number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is a (sufficiently large) [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge \ N&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\left | S_n - \ell \right \vert \le \ \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
If the series is convergent, the number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; (necessarily unique) is called the '''sum of the series'''.

{{defn|The '''fundamental theorem of calculus''' is a [[theorem]] that links the concept of [[derivative|differentiating]] a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with the concept of [[integral|integrating]] a function. The first part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''first fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that one of the [[antiderivative]]s (also called ''indefinite integral''), say ''F'', of some function ''f'' may be obtained as the integral of ''f'' with a variable bound of integration. This implies the existence of [[antiderivative]]s for [[continuous function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the second part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''second fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that the integral of a function ''f'' over some interval can be computed by using any one, say ''F'', of its infinitely many [[antiderivative]]s. This part of the theorem has key practical applications, because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by [[symbolic integration]] avoids [[numerical integration]] to compute integrals. This provides generally a better numerical accuracy.}}

{{defn|defn=In [[mathematics]], a '''harmonic progression''' (or '''harmonic sequence''') is a progression formed by taking the reciprocals of an [[arithmetic progression]]. It is a [[sequence]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{a} ,\ \frac{1}{a+d}\ , \frac{1}{a+2d}\ , \frac{1}{a+3d}\ , \cdots, \frac{1}{a+kd},&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;minus;a/''d'' is not a [[natural number]] and ''k'' '''is''' a natural number.

Equivalently, a sequence is a harmonic progression when each term is the [[harmonic mean]] of the neighboring terms.

It is not possible for a harmonic progression (other than the trivial case where ''a'' = 1 and ''k'' = 0)  to sum to an [[integer]]. The reason is that, necessarily, at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a [[prime number]] that does not divide any other denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P.|last= Erdős |authorlink=Paul Erdős |title=Egy Kürschák-féle elemi számelméleti tétel általánosítása|trans-title=Generalization of an elementary number-theoretic theorem of Kürschák|language=Hungarian|journal=Mat.

[[File:Leningrad bede.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest historiated initial known, St Petersburg Bede, 8th century]]

A '''historiated initial''' is an [[initial]], an enlarged [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] at the beginning of a paragraph or other section of text, that contains a picture. Strictly speaking, a historiated initial depicts an identifiable figure or a specific scene, while an [[inhabited initial]] contains figures (human or animal) that are decorative only, without forming a subject. Both sorts became very common and elaborate in luxury [[illuminated manuscript]]s. These illustrated initials were first seen in the [[Insular art]] of the early 8th century. The earliest known example is in the [[Saint Petersburg Bede]], an Insular manuscript of 731-46, and the [[Vespasian Psalter]] has another.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=10}}

The size and decoration of the initial further gives clues to both its importance and location. Letters that began a new section of a text or a particularly noteworthy section might receive more flourishes and space. In luxury manuscripts an entire page might be devoted to a historiated initial.{{sfn|Clemens|Graham|2007|p=29}} Both the size and the ostentatiousness of a manuscript reflect both on the status of the manuscript and on its owner. Manuscripts meant for everyday use, typically by friars or university students, often had little illumination, and hardly any elaborate historiated initials or flourishes. Manuscripts commissioned by wealthy patrons or for a wealthy monastery were often  illuminated, and in gold or silver rather than pen and ink.

{{sexual orientation}}'''Innate bisexuality''' (or ''predisposition to bisexuality'') is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] (based on work by his associate [[Wilhelm Fliess]]), that expounds all humans are born [[bisexuality|bisexual]] but through psychological development (which includes both external and internal factors) most become [[monosexuality|monosexual]] while the bisexuality remains in a latent state.&lt;ref name=Huffpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packman|first1=Carl|title=Gore Vidal: 'We are all Bisexual'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/carl-packman/gore-vidal-we-are-all-bis_b_1729265.html|website=huffingtonpost.co.uk|publisher=Huffpost Culture|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Carey|title=Trials from Classical Athens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=406CCTn4AAQC&amp;pg=PA1101&amp;dq=freud+innate+bisexuality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KwVT9-WCeHz0gHxv_n_Ag&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no modern scientific consensus as to how biology influences sexual orientation (see [[biology and sexual orientation]]).

== ''Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex'' ==
In his ''Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex'' (1920), Freud discusses the concept of ''inversion'' (i.e. [[homosexuality]]) with respect to its ''innateness'', or the biological predisposition to homosexuality or bisexuality.

The conclusions that he draws are based on the fact that at early stages of development, humans undergo a period of [[hermaphrodism]]. Based on this, he asserts that, "the conception which we gather from this long known anatomical fact is the original predisposition to [[bisexuality]], which in the course of development has changed to monosexuality, leaving slight remnants of the stunted sex."

This develops into a general theory that attraction to both sexes is possible, but that one is more common for each sex. He explains the inversion of homosexual attraction as the result of a traumatic episode or episodes that prevent the normal development of an attraction for the opposite sex.

Freud famously characterized humans as naturally "polymorphously perverse," meaning either that practically any object can be a source of erotic fulfillment, or that babies are relatively indifferent to the object of erotic fulfillment.

== Different usages ==
Many modern uses of the term ''innate bisexuality'' are more indicative of [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s research than Freud's. In this sense, it is a suggestion that most or all human beings are functionally bisexual to some degree, but may not express that bisexuality as behavior.

Both theories have a great deal of controversy surrounding them, so it is particularly important to be aware of which is being discussed.

== Dora ==
"[[Dora (case study)|Dora]]" was Ida Bauer (1882–1945), a patient of Freud's. He used the [[pseudonym]] Dora when writing about their sessions. Often the theory of innate bisexuality is discussed in association with Freud's sessions with Dora.

== Wolf Man ==
Another study often associated with this theory is that of the "[[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]", a patient who tried to repress his homosexual tendencies. Freud explained the Wolf Man's development in terms of an inability to repress his innate feminine nature.

The Institute of Geophysics manages Iran's national seismic data, and directs Iran's national calendar, which is based on the [[Solar calendar]]. The authoring of Iran's official lunar and solar calendars each year is specifically headed by Dr. [[Iraj Malekpour]], a faculty member of [[Tehran University]]. 

The Institute of Geophysics was established as part of [[Tehran University]] by ''Hossein Kashi Afshar'' in 1957. The institute's grounds was where the United States had facilities based for seismically monitoring the [[Soviet Union]]'s nuclear testing programs. 

The institute currently trains Ph.D students in [[Meteorology]], [[Seismology]], [[Electromagnetics]], and [[Gravimetry]], and is still affiliated with the [[University of Tehran]].

'''''Material World''''' was a weekly science magazine programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast on a Thursday afternoon. The programme's regular presenter was [[Quentin Cooper]], with contributions from scientists researching areas under discussion in each programme.

==History==
The programme began as ''The Material World'' in April 1998.  It was presented by [[Trevor Phillips]], a chemistry graduate of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]]. In September 2000 Phillips was told that he could no longer work at the BBC due to his close links with the Labour Party, which broke BBC rules of impartiality. He was one of the few regular black broadcasters on Radio 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/24/uk.labour1| title=BBC bans Trevor Phillips for political link| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| date=24 September 2000| first=Kamal| last=Ahmed| author-link=Kamal Ahmed (journalist) |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was presented by Quentin Cooper from 2000 to its end in 2013.

Material World was one of the BBC's main conduits for up-to-date scientific news, along with ''[[Frontiers (radio programme)|Frontiers]]'', ''[[Science in Action – BBC World Service Radio|Science in Action]]'', and ''[[Bang Goes the Theory]]''.

From 5 April 2010 the programme was repeated on a Monday evening at 21.00, in the former slot of ''[[Costing the Earth]]''. For a short time, when programmes on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] began [[Streaming media|webstreaming]] with video, ''Material World'' was also [[webcast]].

On 14 June 2013 it was announced that the show was to be cancelled, to be replaced by a new show, ''Inside Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/Introducing-Inside-Science |title = Introducing Inside Science |last = Bakaya |first = Mohit |date = 14 June 2013 |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last programme presented by Quentin Cooper was broadcast on 20 June 2013 with the final episode airing a week later on 27 June 2013, presented by Gareth Mitchell.

==Structure==
A typical episode programme covered three or four topics, giving each 7-10 minutes. For many years the programme was divided into two sections of fifteen minutes on separate topics.{{fact|date=September 2015}} It took the form of interviewing a guest scientist or engineer.  Cooper often ended the programme with a terrible scientific [[pun]].

Many past programmes are available for online listening via the programme's website. Some sequential sets of programmes were made in collaboration with the [[Open University]].

'''''Moses and Monotheism''''' ({{lang-de|Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion}}) is a 1939 book about [[monotheism]] by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]]. It shocked many of its readers because of Freud's suggestion that Moses was actually born an Egyptian,{{vague|reason= unless that's supposed to mean something other than "to an Egyptian woman", please use exactly that wording|date=May 2018}} rather than merely raised as an Egyptian.

==Summary==
The book consists of three essays and is an extension of Freud’s work on [[psychoanalytic theory]] as a means of generating hypotheses about historical events. Freud hypothesizes that [[Moses]] was not [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], but actually born into [[Ancient Egypt]]ian nobility and was probably a follower of [[Akhenaten]], an ancient Egyptian [[monotheism|monotheist]].  The [[Bible|biblical]] story of Moses is contradicted by Freud, who retells the events, claiming that Moses led only his close followers into freedom (during an unstable period in Egyptian history after Akhenaten's death ca. 1350 BCE), that they subsequently killed Moses in rebellion, and still later joined with another monotheistic tribe in [[Midian]] who worshipped a [[volcano god]] they called [[Yahweh]]. Freud supposed that the god of Moses was fused with Yahweh, and that the deeds of Moses were ascribed{{vague|reason = how? &amp; by whom?: (not by the Eg'n Moses himself, but some successor or usurper |date=May 2018}} to a [[Midian]]ite priest also called Moses.{{Vague|reason= 1.sheer coincidence 2. The [[folk process]] 3. Confusion between the original and a similar or identical name given to a successor to Eg'n Moses|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yerushalmi|first1=Yosef|title=Freud's Moses: Terminable and Interminable|date=1991|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-04921-8|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud explains that centuries after the murder of the Egyptian Moses, the rebels regretted their action, thus forming the concept of the Messiah as a hope for the return of Moses as the [[Salvation|Saviour]] of the [[Israelites]]. Freud said that the guilt from the murder of Moses is inherited through the generations; this guilt then drives the [[Jew]]s to [[religion]] to make them feel better.

==Publication history==
''Moses and Monotheism'' was first published in 1939. It appeared in English translation the same year.

==Reception==
The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] wrote that Freud's suggestion that Moses was an Egyptian "delivered a shock to many of his admirers". According to Campbell, Freud's proposal was widely attacked, "both with learning and without." Campbell himself refrained from passing judgment on Freud's views about Moses, although he considered Freud's willingness to publish his work despite its potential offensiveness "noble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1965 |pages=125–127 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Rowan Williams]] concluded that Freud's accounts of the origin of Judaism are "painfully absurd", and that Freud's explanations are not scientific but rather "imaginative frameworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first = Rowan|last = Williams|article = Freudian Psychology|title = A New Dictionary of Christian Theology|editor1 = [[Alan Richardson (priest)|Alan Richardson]]|editor2 = [[John Bowden (theologian)|John Bowden]]|publisher = SCM Press|location = London|year = 1983|ISBN = 0 334 02208 8|page = 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]] and the psychologist [[Sonu Shamdasani]] write that in ''Moses and Monotheism'' Freud applied to history "the same method of interpretation that he used in the privacy of his office to 'reconstruct' his patients' forgotten and repressed memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Borch-Jacobsen, Mikkel |author2=Shamdasani, Sonu |title=The Freud Files: An Inquiry into the History of Psychoanalysis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2012 |pages=179–180 |isbn=978-0-521-72978-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9591">'''Musica Reservata''' was an [[early music]] group founded in London in the late 1950s by Irishman [[Michael Morrow]] and the musician, conductor and composer [[John S. Beckett|John Beckett]].

==Beginnings==
[[Michael Morrow]] and John Beckett left [[Dublin]] for London in late 1953 and settled in [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gannon, ''John S. Beckett&amp;nbsp;— The Man and the Music'', Dublin: 2016, The Lilliput Press, {{ISBN|9781843516651}}, pp. 89-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow, who originally was interested in art, had become interested in [[early music]] and had learned to play the [[lute]]. In his spare time, he began to transcribe old music from a variety of sources found in libraries and museums in London. Over the years he became a formidable musicologist and scholar.&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; As he had become rather dissatisfied by the performances of early music on gramophone records and the [[BBC Third Programme]], he turned his attention to European and non-European folk and art music, in which he believed medieval traditions had been preserved. He was also aware that many of the instruments used in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] music had been brought to Europe from the east, as a result of the [[Crusades]], trade through [[Constantinople]] and the [[Moors|Moorish]] occupation of Spain. He also believed that voice production had been eastern and folksy; in European religious paintings, angels were frequently depicted singing with tightened throats and mouths barely open. He therefore felt that much of the music of the medieval and early Renaissance periods should be performed in a more brash manner than what we are used to in modern times, though he was aware that any attempt to perform this music in a definitive 'authentic' manner was next to impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 106-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow decided to call his group Musica Reservata because he considered it to be unlikely that any performance of early music could be a true reproduction of the original sounds.&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows: ''Musica Reservata'', ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1980), Vol. 12, p. 827; ''John S. Beckett'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morrow, the name summed up the problems encountered when performing early music.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Michael Morrow, ''Arts Guardian'', 23 June 1975, p.8; ''John S. Beckett'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group evolved during the 1950s; at first Morrow, Beckett and the recorder player John Sothcott performed privately, sometimes with the counter-tenor [[Grayston Burgess]]. One of the first concerts was a performance for The Fellowship of the White Boar, later renamed [[Ricardian (Richard III)|The Richard III Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musica Reservata'', ''Early Music'', Vol. 4, No. 4, 4 October 1976, p. 515; ''John S. Beckett'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First public concert==
The first proper public concert took place in [[Fenton House]], Hampshire, on 30 January 1960. A programme of medieval music was performed by [[Grayston Burgess]] (counter-tenor), Eric Halfpenny (early cross flute), John Sothcott (recorder), June Baines (tenor viol), [[John S. Beckett|John Beckett]] (tenor viol and regal), [[Francis Baines (musician)|Francis Baines]] (hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes), Michael Morrow (lute) and Jeremy Montagu (percussion). The music consisted of pieces by [[Guillaume Du Fay|Dufay]], [[Binchois]], [[Dunstable]], [[Ockeghem]], [[Francesco Landini|Landini]] and de Lantins.&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 126-7, 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concerts==
More small-scale concerts followed; the next important one was a programme of medieval, Renaissance (and contemporary) music given in the [[Wigmore Hall]], London on 26 June 1963. This was the first concert in which the [[mezzo-soprano]] Jantina Noorman performed. Her unique voice added a very distinctive flavour to the overall sound of the group.&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 145-6, 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early music performer [[David Munrow]] may have played the [[crumhorn]] for the first time with Musica Reservata at a concert held at [[Balliol College]] in [[Oxford]] on 28 November 1965. He later left the group and founded the [[Early Music Consort of London]].&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 164-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group became known after a 'début' concert, given in the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on the [[South Bank]] in London, on 2 July 1967. Six solo singers and twenty-four musicians, conducted by [[John S. Beckett|John Beckett]], performed music of the Italian Renaissance in the first half, and music of the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century France and early sixteenth-century Spain in the second.&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 176-9, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point onwards, the group was regularly engaged for concerts, LPs were recorded and radio programmes were made for the [[BBC Third Programme]]/[[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]].&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', Appendix E, ''Musica Reservata Concerts'', pp. 508-517; Appendix B, ''Discography'', pp. 458-62; Appendix D, ''BBC Radio and Television Broadcasts'', pp. 481-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as performing in England, the group also played in Ireland, France, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], Germany, [[Austria]], [[Portugal]],&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', pp. 513-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, when [[John S. Beckett|John Beckett]] left the group and [[Andrew Parrott]] took over, in the [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;''John S. Beckett'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26052">'''Peace economics''' is a specialized branch of [[economics]].  Peace economics focuses on the design of the sociosphere's political, economic, and cultural institutions and their interacting policies and actions with the goal of preventing, mitigating, or resolving violent conflict within and between societies.  This violent conflict could be of any type and could involve either latent or actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and Raul Caruso. (2012). "Economists and Peacebuilding." In Roger MacGintry (ed.), Handbook on Peacebuilding. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Presuming knowledge of the cost of violence, it focuses on the benefits of (re)constructing societies&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1945). The Economics of Peace. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Castillo, Graciana. (2008). Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and J. Paul Dunne. (2012). Peace Economics: A Macroeconomic Primer for Violence-Afflicted States. Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view toward achieving irreversible, stable [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1978). Stable Peace. Austin, TX: The University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with approaches drawn from disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, geography and regional science, and political science and international relations, peace economics forms part of peace science, an evolving part of [[peace and conflict studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1992). Understanding Conflict and the Science of Peace. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace economics is distinct from both war economics and military economics, even though there may be substantial overlap between these disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Poast, Paul. (2006). The Economics of War. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Keith and Todd Sandler, eds. (1995). Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 1. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Todd and Keith Hartley. (1995). The Economics of Defense. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ron P. (2009). Military Economics: The Interaction of Power and Money. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace economics is also distinct from [[conflict economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hirshleifer, Jack. (2001). The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2009). Principles of Conflict Economics: A Primer for Social Scientists. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is distinct from security economics.&lt;ref&gt;Brück, Tilman. (2005). "An Economic Analysis of Security Policies." Defense and Peace Economics. Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 375-389.&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes a study of the presence of peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity.

==Other definitions==

Peace economics has also been defined as "the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R.

The quote is from p. 1212.&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. [[Walter Isard]] defines peace economics as "generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society."&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Topical Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 11-13. The quote is from p. 11. [A slightly revised reprint of Walter Isard, "Peace Economics" in Douglas Greenwald, Editor in Chief, The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 767-769.]&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that "Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society."&lt;ref&gt;Polachek, Solomon W.

The quote is from p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between "productive" and "unproductive" or "appropriative" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.&lt;ref&gt;Haavelmo, Trygve. (1954).

Economics Nobelist [[Jan Tinbergen]] defines peace economics as "economic science used for [a purpose that] prohibits [war] as an instrument of settling conflicts between nations and [to organize] the world in a way that warfare is punished".&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is addressed only at the level of sovereigns, not dealing with civil war or debilitating organized or individual-level criminal violence. In related work, Tinbergen writes about a [[International relations|world order]] that would inhibit violence and permit peace between and among states. In his view, this requires a "world government",&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3 as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Tinbergen, Jan and Dietrich Fischer (1987). Warfare and Welfare: Integrating Security Policy into Socio-Economic Policy. New York: St. Martin's Press, and Tinbergen Jan. (1990). World Security and Equity. Aldershot, UK: Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment not now commonly agreed among economists. These definitions of peace economics all share [[Johan Galtung]]'s characterization of negative peace (the absence of violent conflict) as opposed to positive peace (the presence of peace-enabling structures).

==Methods, norms, and context==

A number of peace economists are explicit about the use of particular explanatory schema to be applied in peace economics, e.g., [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, Ray. (1994). "Peace Economics as the Political Economy of Peace and War." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main definition of peace economics is open to a variety of approaches. Virtually all authors acknowledge that peace economics is part of both [[positive economics]] and [[normative economics]].&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. (1995). "Some General Observations on the Economics of Peace and War, Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While for most contemporary economists, work in positive economics may lead them to lay out a descriptive array or evaluation of [[policy]] choices from which one that is most valued is recommended to or chosen by policy makers, in peace economics, in contrast, it is the norm of peace to be achieved that inspires the search for a system design that can reliably deliver on the desired norm.

Peace economics is built on [[general systems theory]] exemplified by the work of [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1970). "Economics as a Social Science," pp. 1-22 and "Economics as a Political Science," pp. 77-96, both in Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth may be viewed as a self-regulating ([[homeostatic]]) system, consisting of natural and social subsystems. In each, deviation from a set goal is self-corrected through feedback loops. Homeostatic systems are commonly observed in nature, such as in ecology and in the physiology of organisms (e.g., self-regulation of population sizes, self-regulation of body heat). The systems concept has been adopted in the engineering sciences, for example in designing thermostats. The user sets a desired goal state (temperature), the instrument measures the actual state, and for a deviation of sufficient degree a corrective action is taken (heating or cooling).

Relatively new is the insight that social systems designed to achieve certain purposes (e.g., the retirement or pension system) imply a [[choice architecture]] that may permit failed or failing social systems to persist. Similarly, choice architecture may facilitate the (re)design of institutions aimed at securing beneficial social outcomes such as peace. This is [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] applied to the problem of peace (peace engineering)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Dietrich. (1993). Nonmilitary Aspects of Security: A Systems Approach. Brookfield, VT: Dartmouth Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; and overlaps with ideas of [[mechanism design]] (reverse game theory) in which a solution is stipulated a priori and the structure of the game that would bring about the desired outcome is inferred. In this way, system design links back to normative economics.

==Examples==

===Free trade and peace===
[[File:Economic connections between US, EU, China, Russia and India.png|thumb|Economic ties between the US, EU, China, Russia and India (thickness of the lines is proportional to the bilateral trade volume)]]
The classical English liberals of the 19th century largely believed that [[free trade]] promoted peace. This view, attributed to [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]], was evident in the advocacy of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], and in the writings of the most prominent English economists and political thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alfred Marshall]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] said that he was "brought up" on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent 20th century US exponent of this idea was the Secretary of State under President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Cordell Hull]].

===World War I and the Paris Peace Conference===

Upon resigning from the United Kingdom's Treasury team at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in June 1919, [[John Maynard Keynes]] penned a small book. Published in 1920, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' famously lays out his case for why the allies' Terms of Peace to be imposed on Germany were physically and financially impossible to fulfill and how they would encourage Germany to rise up again. Predicting a coming World War II, Keynes wrote: "... if this view of nations and of their relation to one another (i.e., a [[Carthaginian peace|Carthaginian Peace]]) is adopted by the democracies of Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and the progress of our generation."&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan. The quote is from p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Keynes' effort to change the treaty terms failed, it is a dramatic demonstration of what peace economics is about: the creation of a mutually reinforcing structure of political, economic, and cultural systems to achieve peace such that reversal to violence is unlikely.

===Capitalism and war, and managed capitalism===
In the 1930s, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and with the rise of fascist powers, many western socialist and liberal thinkers believed that capitalism caused war. However, Keynes in his ''General Theory of Enployment, Interest and Money'' in 1936, argued that this need not be so, and that the management of capitalism along the lines he proposed to promote high employment would be more conducive to peace than [[laissez-faire]] capitalism with the [[gold standard]] had been. This analysis underlay his approach during World War II to the creation of institutions for international economic governance in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapters 5 &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II, Bretton Woods, and the Marshall Plan===

Late in World War II, as Nazi-Germany's eventual defeat appeared clear, [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], then-Secretary of the United States Treasury, advocated the partitioning of Germany, stripping it of its most valuable raw materials and industrial assets, and envisioned the complete pastoralization of Germany. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] agreed to the [[Morgenthau Plan]], in modified form, on 16 September 1944. Following victory, Germany's remaining factories were dismantled, parts, machinery, and equipment shipped abroad, patents expropriated, research forbidden, and useful engineers and scientists transferred out of the country. Despite the negotiation of international treaties at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] to create a set of complementary global monetary, trade, and reconstruction and development institutions, namely the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (today part of the [[World Bank Group]]), and, separately, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (incorporated in today's [[World Trade Organization]]), Germany's and Europe's other postwar economies collapsed. Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace appeared to repeat themselves. However, Roosevelt had died and [[Harry S. Truman]] assumed the U.S. American Presidency on 12 April 1945. Even as the deindustrialization of Germany proceeded as planned, Truman's first Secretary of State, [[James F. Byrnes]], by 1947 took a dismal view of its effects on Germany's impoverished population. So did former president [[Herbert C. Hoover]] in a series of reports penned in 1947. Meanwhile, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union emerged as a formidable power and the implication seemed clear: An economically strengthened, resurgent Germany could either be part of a new Western political, economic, and cultural alliance or else be incorporated into a Soviet one. Truman thus came to abolish the punitive measures imposed on Germany, and his new Secretary of State, General [[George C. Marshall]], formulated what would become the [[Marshall Plan]], in effect from 1948 to 1952. The new global institutions and the unilateral Marshall Plan action combined to endow new institutions with sufficient resources to result in a somewhat unwitting peace economics: clearly designed toward the purpose of international peace and prosperity, yet skewed toward Western Europe and the incipient [[Cold War]]. Moreover, the new social architecture was invested with incentives, such as the [[United Nations Security Council]] that provided five of its members with permanent seats and veto powers, that, while keeping superpower peace, threatened peace and prosperity in the post-colonial [[Third World]].

===Origins of the European Union===

Like Keynes, [[Jean Monnet]] participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, in Monnet's case as an assistant to the French delegation. Like Keynes, he envisioned a pan-European economic cooperation zone. Like Keynes, he would be disappointed. Despite this, the French appreciated his good efforts and awarded him with the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the then newly founded [[League of Nations]]. Monnet was but 31 years old. He resigned four years later to devote himself to international business and finance in private capacity but resurfaced during the early World War II years in positions of high influence in France, Britain, and the United States, urging Roosevelt to get on with an industrial armaments plan. Following World War II, Monnet, however, at first crafted the [[Monnet Plan]] which, similar to Morgenthau's, envisioned the transfer of the German [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland]] territories, raw materials, and industries (coal and steel) to France to assist it in its own reconstruction. This was approved by French Prime Minister [[Charles de Gaulle]] shortly before his resignation in January 1946. The transfer of the Saar region took place with U.S. help in 1947, while the Ruhr region was placed under an international authority in 1949 that assured France access to German coal at low prices. This led to rising frictions between Germany and the allies, just as Keynes had foretold 30 years earlier.

Monnet changed course and, together with Paul Reuter, Bernard Clappier, Pierre Uri, and Étienne Hirsch, plans were crafted that resulted in the [[Schuman Declaration]] of 9 May 1950, celebrated today as [[Europe Day]] or Schuman Day. [[Robert Schuman]], the Franco-German-Luxembourgian statesman, French Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs and two-time Prime Minister of France, envisioned, first, a Franco-German and, then, a pan-European sharing of crucial coal and steel resources among Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that would make future war "not only unthinkable but materially impossible."&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 9 May 1950." http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php. (Retrieved on 14 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, this resulted in the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), the forerunner to today's [[European Union]]. In contrast to the negotiations surrounding the founding of the [[United Nations]] and a set of associated organizations in 1945, the European idea appears to have been deliberately designed as a kernel with organic growth-potential, the precise development of which would be learned in future. Thus, no institutional structures were put in place that, due to accrued vested interests, would later prove to be too difficult to change.

===Current research directions===

War at the interstate level has subsided and, to a degree, so have the massive civil wars that took place in the immediate Post-Cold War period (especially in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2009/2010. Human Security Report Project. http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/overview.aspx (Retrieved 14 February 2012.) For longer-term trends, see Steven Pinker, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined '' (New York: Viking, 2011) and literature cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; But violent conflict takes place at many levels, from self-directed harm (e.g., self-injury and [[suicide]]) and [[domestic violence]] between intimate partners and family members to [[workplace violence]] and [[Organized crime|organized criminal violence]], all of which are massively costly and ultimately require positive, structural solutions whereby resort to violence becomes "unthinkable," even as it may remain "materially possible."

The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], a think tank with offices in Sydney, New York, and Mexico City, is "developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic value. It does this by developing global and national indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country level risk and understanding positive peace." &lt;ref&gt;http://economicsandpeace.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phenology''' is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation). The word, coined by the Belgian botanist [[Charles François Antoine Morren|Charles Morren]] around 1849,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s00484-011-0442-5|pmid = 21713602|title = From "Periodical Observations" to "Anthochronology" and "Phenology" – the scientific debate between Adolphe Quetelet and Charles Morren on the origin of the word "Phenology"|journal = International Journal of Biometeorology|volume = 55|issue = 6|pages = 753–761|year = 2011|last1 = Demarée|first1 = Gaston R|last2 = Rutishauser|first2 = This|url = https://boris.unibe.ch/9252/8/484_2011_Article_442.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] φαίνω (''phainō''), "to show, to bring to light, make to appear"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfai%2Fnw φαίνω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; + λόγος (''[[logos]]''), amongst others "study, discourse, reasoning"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos λόγος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and indicates that phenology has been principally concerned with the dates of first occurrence of biological events in their annual cycle. Examples include the date of emergence of leaves and flowers, the first flight of butterflies and the first appearance of [[bird migration|migratory]] birds, the date of leaf colouring and fall in deciduous trees, the dates of egg-laying of birds and amphibia, or the timing of the developmental cycles of [[temperate]]-zone [[honeybee|honey bee]] colonies. In the scientific literature on [[ecology]], the term is used more generally to indicate the time frame for any seasonal biological phenomena, including the dates of last appearance (e.g., the seasonal phenology of a species may be from April through September).

Because many such phenomena are very sensitive to small variations in [[climate]], especially to temperature, phenological records can be a useful [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] for temperature in [[historical climatology]], especially in the study of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. For example, viticultural records of grape harvests in Europe have been used to reconstruct a record of summer growing season temperatures going back more than 500 years.&lt;ref name=Meier2007a&gt;

==Past records==
Observations of phenological events have provided indications of the progress of the natural calendar since ancient agricultural times. Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: "When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet" or attempt to forecast future climate: "If oak's before ash, you're in for a splash. If ash before oak, you're in for a soak". But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: "If the oak is out before the [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], 'Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak,'Twill be a summer of fire and smoke." Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.

The [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by Wells W. Cooke, involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.

The English naturalists [[Gilbert White]] and [[William Markwick]] reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in [[Selborne]], Hampshire and William Markwick in [[Battle, Sussex]] over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White's ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''&lt;ref name=white&gt;White, G (1789) [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]&lt;/ref&gt; are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.

In Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available. For example, records of the harvest dates of the [[pinot noir]] [[grape]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] have been used in an attempt to reconstruct spring–summer temperatures from 1370 to 2003;&lt;ref name=Chuine&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chuine | first1 = I. | last2 = Yiou | first2 = P. | last3 = Viovy | first3 = N. | last4 = Seguin | first4 = B. | last5 = Daux | first5 = V. | last6 = Le Roy | first6 = Ladurie | year = 2004 | title = Grape ripening as a past climate indicator | url = http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fe/pdf/2004_Nature_432_289_290.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7015 | pages = 289–290 | doi = 10.1038/432289a | pmid = 15549085 | bibcode = 2004Natur.432..289C | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144441/http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fe/pdf/2004_Nature_432_289_290.pdf | archivedate = 2011-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keenan2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = D.J. | year = 2007 | title = Grape harvest dates are poor indicators of summer warmth | url = http://www.informath.org/pubs/TAC06a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Theoretical and Applied Climatology | volume = 87 | issue = 1–4| pages = 255–256 | doi = 10.1007/s00704-006-0197-9 |bibcode = 2007ThApC..87..255K }}&lt;/ref&gt; the reconstructed values during 1787–2000 have a correlation with Paris instrumental data of about 0.75.

==Modern records==
=== Phenological observations in Great Britain ===
[[Robert Marsham]], the founding father of modern phenological recording, was a wealthy landowner who kept systematic records of "Indications of spring" on his estate at [[Stratton Strawless]], [[Norfolk]], from 1736. These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham's family maintained consistent records of the same events or "phenophases" over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years. Between 1850 and 1950 a long-term trend of gradual climate warming is observable, and during this same period the Marsham record of oak-leafing dates tended to become earlier.&lt;ref name="Sparks &amp; Carey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sparks | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Carey | first2 = P.D. | year = 1995 | title = The responses of species to climate over two centuries: an analysis of the Marsham phenological record, 1736-1947 | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–329 | doi = 10.2307/2261570 | jstor = 2261570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960 the rate of warming accelerated, and this is mirrored by increasing earliness of oak leafing, recorded in the data collected by Jean Combes in Surrey. Over the past 250 years, the first leafing date of oak appears to have advanced by about 8 days, corresponding to overall warming on the order of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C in the same period.

Towards the end of the 19th century the recording of the appearance and development of plants and animals became a national pastime, and between 1891 and 1948 the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] (RMS) organised a programme of phenological recording across the British Isles. Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred. During this period 11 main plant phenophases were consistently recorded over the 58 years from 1891–1948, and a further 14 phenophases were recorded for the 20 years between 1929 and 1948. The returns were summarised each year in the Quarterly Journal of the RMS as ''[[The Phenological Reports]]''. Jeffree (1960) summarised the 58 years of data,&lt;ref name=Jeffree1960&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeffree | first1 = E.P. | year = 1960 | title = Some long-term means from the Phenological reports (1891–1948) of the Royal Meteorological Society | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society | volume = 86 | issue = 367| pages = 95–103 | doi = 10.1002/qj.49708636710 |bibcode = 1960QJRMS..86...95J }}&lt;/ref&gt; which show that flowering dates could be as many as 21 days early and as many as 34 days late, with extreme earliness greatest in summer-flowering species, and extreme lateness in spring-flowering species. In all 25 species, the timings of all phenological events are significantly related to temperature,&lt;ref name=Sparks2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sparks | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Jeffree | first2 = E.P. | last3 = Jeffree | first3 = C.E. |name-list-format= vanc | year = 2000 | title = An examination of the relationship between flowering times and temperature at the national scale using long-term phenological records from the UK | url = | journal = International Journal of Biometeorology | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 82–87 | doi = 10.1007/s004840000049 | pmid = 10993562 | bibcode = 2000IJBm...44...82S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217190747/https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/trx39rutgulmbmwn/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&amp;sid=w4lgorijbyuqsz552uo5bbqb&amp;sh=www.springerlink.com SpringerLink - Abstract&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that phenological events are likely to get earlier as climate warms.

''The Phenological Reports'' ended suddenly in 1948 after 58 years, and Britain remained without a national recording scheme for almost 50 years, just at a time when climate change was becoming evident. During this period, individual dedicated observers made important contributions. The naturalist and author [[Richard Fitter]] recorded the First Flowering Date (FFD) of 557 species of British flowering plants in Oxfordshire between about 1954 and 1990. Writing in [[Science (journal)| ''Science'']] in 2002, Richard Fitter and his son [[Alistair Fitter]] found that "the average FFD of 385 British plant species has advanced by 4.5 days during the past decade compared with the previous four decades."&lt;ref name=Fitter2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitter | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Fitter | first2 = R.S.R. |name-list-format= vanc | year = 2002 | title = Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants | url = | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573| pages = 1689–1691 | doi = 10.1126/science.1071617 | pmid = 12040195 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1689F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201/1/fitterah4.pdf |title= Rapid Changes in Flowering Time in British Plants |publisher= SCIENCE |volume= 296 |date= 31 May 2002 |accessdate= 2010-05-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172606/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201/1/fitterah4.pdf |archivedate= 18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They note that FFD is sensitive to temperature, as is generally agreed, that "150 to 200 species may be flowering on average 15 days earlier in Britain now than in the very recent past" and that these earlier FFDs will have "profound ecosystem and evolutionary consequences".

In the last decade,{{when?|date=May 2018}} national recording in Britain has been resumed by the UK Phenology network [http://www.naturescalendar.org.uk], run by the [[Woodland Trust]], the [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]] and the BBC Springwatch survey.&lt;ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070209113737/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/wildbritain/springwatch/survey.shtml BBC - Science &amp; Nature - UK Wildlife - Springwatch survey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Airborne sensors==
Recent technological advances in studying the earth from space have resulted in a new field of phenological research that is concerned with observing the phenology of whole [[ecosystem]]s and stands of [[vegetation]] on a global scale using proxy approaches. These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.

The most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]](NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation's typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near [[Infrared]] (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NDVI}={\mathrm{NIR}-\mathrm{red} \over \mathrm{NIR}+\mathrm{red}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:MODIS NDVI Temporal Profile Conifer.jpg|thumb|400px|NDVI temporal profile for a typical patch of coniferous forest over a period of six years. This temporal profile depicts the growing season every year as well as changes in this profile from year to year due to climatic and other constraints. Data and graph are based on the [[MODIS]] sensor standard public vegetation index product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbrs.arizona.edu/cdrom/Index.html Tbrs, Modis Vi Cd-Rom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230054329/http://tbrs.arizona.edu/cdrom/Index.html |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data archived at the [[ORNL]] DAAC [http://daac.ornl.gov/], courtesy of Dr. Robert Cook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050519112205/http://daac.ornl.gov/articles/DAAC_Annual/From_the_Ground_Up.pdf 49971CU_Txt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The evolution of the vegetation index through time, depicted by the graph above, exhibits a strong [[correlation]] with the typical green vegetation growth stages (emergence, vigor/growth, maturity, and harvest/senescence). These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of [[growing season]], etc.). Other growing season [[parameter]]s could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of [[climate change|climatic change]] studies.

A noteworthy example of the use of [[remote sensing]] based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni&lt;ref&gt;[http://cybele.bu.edu/people/rmyneni.html Welcome to the Climate and Vegetation Research Group, Boston University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Boston University]].

However, these phenological parameters are only an approximation of the true biological growth stages. This is mainly due to the limitation of current space-based remote sensing, especially the spatial resolution, and the nature of vegetation index. A pixel in an image does not contain a pure target (like a tree, a shrub, etc.) but contains a mixture of whatever intersected the sensor's field of view.

'''Photovoice''' also known as '''picturevoice''' is a qualitative method used for [[community-based participatory research]] to document and reflect reality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://teamlab.usc.edu/files/2018/08/Photovoice-Literature-Review-FINAL-22ltfmn.pdf Darrah L Goo Kuratani &amp; Elaine Lai (2011).

Participants are asked to express their points of view or represent their communities by photographing scenes that highlight research themes. Common research themes include community concerns, community assets, social issues, and public health barriers.&lt;ref name=wang97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. C., Yi, W. K., Tao, Z.

(2010). Photovoice: A review of the literature in health and public health. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 37(3), 424-451.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Photovoice was developed in 1992 by Caroline C. Wang of the [[University of Michigan]], and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express communities and individual's needs, problems, and desires.&lt;ref name="Nykiforuk 103–124"/&gt; In addition, the concept was strongly influenced by [[documentary photography]], the concept [[empowerment]], [[feminist theory]], [[Paulo Freire]]'s [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] to promote health education and his idea of [[critical consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, N., &amp; Bernstein, E. (1988). Empowerment Education: Freire's Ideas Adapted to Health Education. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 15(4), 379-394. {{doi|10.1177/109019818801500402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strack RW, Magill C., &amp; McDonagh, K.|first=|date=|title=Engaging youth through Photovoice|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|journal=Health Promotion Practice|volume=5|pages=49–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C., &amp; Burris, M. A. (1994). Empowerment through Photo Novella: Portraits of Participation. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 21(2), 171-186. {{doi|10.1177/109019819402100204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, the method has been used in different settings and populations, such as by refugees in San Diego seeking in–person medical interpretation options, by homeless adults in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], by Dr. Claudia Mitchell to support community health workers and teachers in rural [[South Africa]], and by Dr. Laura S. Lorenz of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in her work with brain injury survivors.&lt;ref name="photovoice with brain injury survivors"&gt;Lorenz, LS (2010) "Brain Injury Survivors: Narratives of Rehabilitation and Healing." Disability in Society, Ronald J. Berger, Series Editor. Boulder, CO and London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|title=Engaging Youth through Photovoice |last=Strack |first=Robert |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern implementation==
In the 21st century, some university professors have used the photovoice model to teach social work students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=08ef2abd-236a-4cf8-87b0-615ee0f10996%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=4101 | title=Using Photo Voice to Teach Social Issues With Undergraduate Social Work Students | author=Oden, Melissa | journal=Texas Public Health Journal |date=September 2013 | volume=65 | issue=4 | pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photovoice has also been used in conjunction with collaging, drawing, and mapping in participatory studies which focus on the voice of participants and aim to make the familiar strange.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Mannay, D. 2013. ‘Who put that on there... why why why?:’ Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production. Visual Studies, 28 (2), pp.136-146 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1472586X.2013.801635&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been used as a tool to engage children and youth, giving them a safe environment and opportunity to communicate their concerns and coping strategies to policymakers and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Skovdal, M. (2011) “Picturing the coping strategies of caregiving children in Western Kenya: from images to action.” American Journal of Public Health 101(3): 452-453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, photovoice is used at all levels as a tool for self-development, sharing awareness, advocacy, research, needs assessment, monitoring, etc. So the use of photovoice allows one to capture and widen their perspective on all levels of various issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Variants==
Also known as "participatory photography" or "photo novella", photovoice is considered a sub–type of "[[participatory art|participatory visual methods]]" or '''picturevoice''' which includes techniques such as photo-elicitation and digital storytelling. These techniques allow research participants to create visuals that capture their individual perspectives as part of the research process.&lt;ref name="sophe"&gt;"Picturevoice: Health Communication Through Art." Presentation. [[Society for Public Health Education]] 60th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="participatory visual methods"&gt;Lorenz, LS and B Kolb (2009). Involving the public through participatory visual research methods. Health Expectations, Volume 12, Issue 3, pp 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is found in [[Project Lives]], a participatory photography project used to create a new image of project housing dwellers, published in April 2015. Two other forms of picturevoice include '''paintvoice''', stemming from the work of Michael Yonas, and '''comicvoice''', which has been pioneered by John Baird's ''[[Create a Comic Project]]'' since 2008, and to a lesser extent by Michael Bitz's ''[[Comic Book Project]]''.&lt;ref name="apha"&gt;"Healthy Holidays: Lessons Learned from a Community Education Event." Presentation. [[American Public Health Association]] 137th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA1"&gt;"Comicvoice: Community education through sequential art." Pop Culture Association - American Culture Association, St. Louis, MO. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==International development==
In international research, photovoice has been seen to allow participants from the developing world to define how they want to be represented to the international community. The individuals are facilitated and given control to tell their stories and perspectives which empower them to be engaged and maintain a firm sense of authorship over their representations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This helps to convey a stereotype-free picture of what it means to live in a [[developing country]] to those supporting (i.e. funders and voters of the [[developed country]]) and doing international development (i.e. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and [[Government agency|government agencies]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Skovdal, M., Cornish, F., (2015) "Qualitative Research for Development: A guide for practitioners" Rugby, UK: Practical Action Publishing (Chapter 6 - Photovoice: Methodology and Use)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, photovoice allows the community to monitor the impact of the change created by development programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This can help inform the outside agency about the process, true impacts (what is/isn't working and why), and complex reality,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/matt-daw-participation-in-development/|title=PhotoVoice   » Participation in Development|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus accompany wider and deeper research and analysis to improve the development progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/international-projects/|title=PhotoVoice   » International Projects|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant morphology "represents a study of the development, form, and structure of plants, and, by implication, an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin."&lt;ref&gt;Harold C. Bold, C. J. Alexopoulos, and T. Delevoryas. ''Morphology of Plants and Fungi'', 5th ed., page 3. (New York: Harper-Collins, 1987). {{ISBN|0-06-040839-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology, and each overlaps with another field of the [[biological sciences]].

First of all, morphology is '''[[comparative phylogenetics|comparative]]''', meaning that the morphologist examines structures in many different plants of the same or different species, then draws comparisons and formulates ideas about similarities. When structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common, inherited [[genetics|genetic]] pathways, those structures are termed [[homology (biology)|homologous]].  For example, the [[leaf|leaves]] of [[Pinus|pine]], [[oak]], and [[cabbage]] all look very different, but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts.  The homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make.  The plant morphologist goes further, and discovers that the [[spine (botany)|spines]] of [[Cactaceae|cactus]] also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants, and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well.  This aspect of plant morphology overlaps with the study of plant [[evolution]] and [[paleobotany]].

Secondly, plant morphology observes both the '''vegetative''' ('''somatic''') structures of plants, as well as the '''reproductive''' structures.  The vegetative structures of [[vascular plant]]s includes the study of the shoot system, composed of [[plant stem|stems]] and [[leaf|leaves]], as well as the [[root]] system.  The reproductive structures are more varied, and are usually specific to a particular group of plants, such as [[flower]]s and [[seed]]s, fern [[sorus|sori]], and [[moss]] capsules.  The detailed study of reproductive structures in plants led to the discovery of the [[alternation of generations]] found in all plants and most [[alga]]e.  This area of plant morphology overlaps with the study of [[biodiversity]] and [[plant systematics]].

Thirdly, plant morphology studies plant structure at a range of scales.  At the smallest scales are '''[[ultrastructure]]''', the general structural features of cells visible only with the aid of an [[electron microscope]], and '''[[Cell biology|cytology]]''', the study of cells using [[optical microscopy]].  At this scale, plant morphology overlaps with [[plant anatomy]] as a field of study.  At the largest scale is the study of plant '''growth habit''', the overall architecture of a plant.  The pattern of branching in a [[tree]] will vary from species to species, as will the appearance of a plant as a [[tree]], [[herb]], or [[grass]].

Fourthly, plant morphology examines the pattern of '''development''', the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows.  While animals produce all the body parts they will ever have from early in their life, plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life.  A living plant always has embryonic tissues.  The way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plant's life when they begin to develop, as well as by the environment to which the structures are exposed.  A morphologist studies this process, the causes, and its result.  This area of plant morphology overlaps with [[plant physiology]] and [[ecology]].

== A comparative science ==
A plant morphologist makes comparisons between structures in many different plants of the same or different species.  Making such comparisons between similar structures in different plants tackles the question of ''why'' the structures are similar.  It is quite likely that similar underlying causes of genetics, physiology, or response to the environment have led to this similarity in appearance.  The result of scientific investigation into these causes can lead to one of two insights into the underlying biology:

# '''[[Homology (biology)|Homology]]''' - the structure is similar between the two species because of shared ancestry and common genetics.
# '''[[Convergent evolution|Convergence]]''' - the structure is similar between the two species because of independent adaptation to common environmental pressures.

Understanding which characteristics and structures belong to each type is an important part of understanding plant [[evolution]].  The evolutionary biologist relies on the plant morphologist to interpret structures, and in turn provides [[phylogenetics|phylogenies]] of plant relationships that may lead to new morphological insights.

=== Homology ===
{{main article|Homology (biology)}}

When structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common, inherited genetic pathways, those structures are termed ''homologous''. For example, the leaves of pine, oak, and cabbage all look very different, but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts. The homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make. The plant morphologist goes further, and discovers that the spines of cactus also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants, and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well.

=== Convergence ===
{{main article|Convergent evolution}}

When structures in different species are believed to exist and develop as a result of common adaptive responses to environmental pressure, those structures are termed ''convergent''.  For example, the fronds of ''[[Bryopsis plumosa]]'' and stems of ''[[Asparagus setaceus]]'' both have the same feathery branching appearance, even though one is an alga and one is a flowering plant.  The similarity in overall structure occurs independently as a result of convergence.  The growth form of many [[Cactaceae|cacti]] and species of ''[[Euphorbia]]'' is very similar, even though they belong to widely distant families.  The similarity results from common solutions to the problem of surviving in a hot, dry envir
== Vegetative and reproductive characteristics ==

{{plain image|File:Plant.svg|A diagram representing a "typical" [[eudicot]].|330px|left|bottom|triangle|#43d050}}

Plant morphology treats both the vegetative structures of plants, as well as the reproductive structures.

The '''vegetative''' ('''somatic''') structures of [[vascular plant]]s include two major organ systems: (1) a '''shoot system''', composed of [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[Leaf|leaves]], and (2) a '''root system'''. These two systems are common to nearly all vascular plants, and provide a unifying theme for the study of plant morphology.

By contrast, the '''reproductive''' structures are varied, and are usually specific to a particular group of plants.  Structures such as [[flower]]s and [[fruit]]s are only found in the [[angiosperm]]s; [[sorus|sori]] are only found in [[fern]]s; and [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are only found in [[conifer]]s and other gymnosperms.  Reproductive characters are therefore regarded as more useful for the classification of plants than vegetative characters.

Plant biologists use morphological characters of plants which can be compared, measured, counted and described to assess the differences or similarities in plant taxa and use these characters for plant identification, classification and descriptions.

When characters are used in descriptions or for identification they are called '''diagnostic''' or '''key characters''' which can be either qualitative and quantitative.

# Quantitative characters are morphological features that can be counted or measured for example a plant species has flower petals 10–12&amp;nbsp;mm wide.
# Qualitative characters are morphological features such as leaf shape, flower color or pubescence.

Both kinds of characters can be very useful for the identification of plants.

=== Alternation of generations ===
{{main article|Alternation of generations}}

The detailed study of reproductive structures in plants led to the discovery of the [[alternation of generations]], found in all plants and most [[alga]]e, by the German botanist [[Wilhelm Hofmeister]].  This discovery is one of the most important made in all of plant morphology, since it provides a common basis for understanding the life cycle of all plants.

=== Pigmentation in plants ===
{{main article|Plant color}}

The primary function of pigments in plants is [[photosynthesis]], which uses the green pigment [[chlorophyll]] along with several red and yellow pigments that help to capture as much light energy as possible.  Pigments are also an important factor in attracting [[insect]]s to flowers to encourage [[pollination]].

Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecule, including [[porphyrin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, [[anthocyanin]]s and [[betalain]]s. All biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths of [[light]] while [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]]ing others. The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power chemical reactions, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the color the pigment will appear to the eye.

== Morphology in development ==
{{main|Plant development}}
Plant '''development''' is the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows.  It is a subject studies in [[plant anatomy]] and [[plant physiology]] as well as plant morphology.

The process of development in plants is fundamentally different from that seen in [[vertebrate]] animals.  When an animal [[embryo]] begins to develop, it will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature. By contrast, plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from '''[[meristem]]s'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=961–70|pmid= 14505363|year=2003|last1=Bäurle|first1=I|last2=Laux|first2=T|title=Apical meristems: The plant's fountain of youth|volume=25|issue=10|doi=10.1002/bies.10341|journal=BioEssays}}  Review.&lt;/ref&gt; located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues.

The properties of organization seen in a plant are '''[[emergence|emergent properties]]''' which are more than the sum of the individual parts.  "The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. C. ''Plant Growth and Development'', page 183. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, knowing everything about the molecules in a plant are not enough to predict characteristics of the cells; and knowing all the properties of the cells will not predict all the properties of a plant's structure.

=== Growth ===
{{further|Meristem|Cellular differentiation|Morphogenesis|Plant embryogenesis}}

A [[vascular plant]] begins from a single celled [[zygote]], formed by [[fertilisation]] of an egg cell by a sperm cell.  From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant [[embryo]] through the process of '''embryogenesis'''.  As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot.  In [[seed]] plants, the embryo will develop one or more "seed leaves" ([[cotyledon]]s).  By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life.

Once the embryo [[germination|germinates]] from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of '''organogenesis'''.  New roots grow from root [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=134–41|pmid=11169586|year=2001|last1=Brand|first1=U|last2=Hobe|first2=M|last3=Simon|first3=R|title=Functional domains in plant shoot meristems|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200102)23:2&lt;134::AID-BIES1020&gt;3.0.CO;2-3|journal=BioEssays}} Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone [[cellular differentiation]] to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot.  Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed [[primary growth]] and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. [[Secondary growth]] results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=533–41|pmid= 15832381|year=2005|last1=Barlow|first1=P|title=Patterned cell determination in a plant tissue: The secondary phloem of trees|volume=27|issue=5|doi=10.1002/bies.20214|journal=BioEssays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to growth by [[cell (biology)|cell]] division, a plant may grow through '''cell elongation'''. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length.  When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light ([[phototropism]]), gravity ([[gravitropism]]), water, ([[hydrotropism]]), and physical contact ([[thigmotropism]]).

Plant growth and development are mediated by specific [[plant hormone]]s and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983).&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;Ross, S.D.; Pharis, R.P.; Binder, W.D. 1983. Growth regulators and conifers: their physiology and potential uses in forestry. p. 35–78 ''in'' Nickell, L.G. (Ed.), Plant growth regulating chemicals. Vol. 2, CRC Press, Boca Raton FL.&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.

=== Morphological variation ===
Plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure.  While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation.  Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts.  This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation.  There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.

=== Evolution of plant morphology ===
Transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles in plant morphogenesis and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex morphogenesis of land plants.&lt;ref name="MBE_1767"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. | title= An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors|journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution | date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7|doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positional effects ====
[[File:Leaf samples from the giant ragweed.jpg|thumb|right|280x|Variation in leaves from the giant ragweed illustrating positional effects. The lobed leaves come from the base of the plant, while the unlobed leaves come from the top of the plant.]]
Although plants produce numerous copies of the same organ during their lives, not all copies of a particular organ will be identical.  There is variation among the parts of a mature plant resulting from the relative position where the organ is produced.  For example, along a new branch the leaves may vary in a consistent pattern along the branch.  The form of leaves produced near the base of the branch will differ from leaves produced at the tip of the plant, and this difference is consistent from branch to branch on a given plant and in a given species.  This difference persists after the leaves at both ends of the branch have matured, and is not the result of some leaves being younger than others.

==== Environmental effects ====
The way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plants life when they begin to develop, as well as by the environment to which the structures are exposed. This can be seen in [[aquatic plant]]s and [[emergent plant]]s.

=====Temperature=====

Temperature has a multiplicity of effects on plants depending on a variety of factors, including the size and condition of the plant and the temperature and duration of exposure. The smaller and more [[Succulent plant|succulent the plant]], the greater the susceptibility to damage or death from temperatures that are too high or too low. Temperature affects the rate of biochemical and physiological processes, rates generally (within limits) increasing with temperature. However, the Van’t Hoff relationship for monomolecular reactions (which states that the velocity of a reaction is doubled or trebled by a temperature increase of 10&amp;nbsp;°C) does not strictly hold for biological processes, especially at low and high temperatures.

When water freezes in plants, the consequences for the plant depend very much on whether the freezing occurs intracellularly (within cells) or outside cells in intercellular (extracellular) spaces.&lt;ref name="Glerum1985"&gt;Glerum, C. 1985. Frost hardiness of coniferous seedlings: principles and applications. p. 107–123 ''in ''Duryea, M.L. (Ed.). Proceedings: Evaluating seedling quality: principles, procedures, and predictive abilities of major tests. Workshop, October 1984, Oregon State Univ., For. Res. Lab., Corvallis OR.&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular freezing usually kills the cell regardless of the hardiness of the plant and its tissues.&lt;ref name="Lyons1979"&gt;Lyons, J.M.; Raison, J.K.; Steponkus, P.L. 1979. The plant membrane in response to low temperature: an overview. p. 1–24 ''in'' Lyons, J.M.; Graham, D.; Raison, J.K. (Eds.). Low Temperature Stress in Crop Plants. Academic Press, New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular freezing seldom occurs in nature, but moderate rates of decrease in temperature, e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;°C to 6&amp;nbsp;°C/hour, cause intercellular ice to form, and this "extraorgan ice"&lt;ref name="SakaiLarcher1987"&gt;Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) 1987. Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; may or may not be lethal, depending on the hardiness of the tissue.

At freezing temperatures, water in the intercellular spaces of plant tissues freezes first, though the water may remain unfrozen until temperatures fall below 7&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Glerum1985" /&gt; After the initial formation of ice intercellularly, the cells shrink as water is lost to the segregated ice. The cells undergo freeze-drying, the dehydration being the basic cause of freezing injury.

The rate of cooling has been shown to influence the frost resistance of tissues,&lt;ref name="Sakai1979a"&gt;Sakai, A. 1979a. Freezing avoidance mechanism of primordial shoots of conifer buds. Plant Cell Physiol. 20:1381–1390.&lt;/ref&gt; but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue.&lt;ref name="levitt"&gt;Levitt, J. 1980. Responses of Plants to Environmental Stresses. Volume 1. Chilling, Freezing, and High Temperature Stresses, 2nd ed. Academic Press, New York NY. 497 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Sakai (1979a)&lt;ref name="Sakai1979a" /&gt; demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30&amp;nbsp;°C to -40&amp;nbsp;°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in [[liquid nitrogen]] when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50&amp;nbsp;°C or lower.&lt;ref name="SakaiLarcher1987" /&gt; The hardiness of the winter buds of such [[Pinophyta|conifers]] is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of ''Picea'' and ''Pinus'', the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants,&lt;ref name="SakaiOkada1971"&gt;Sakai, A.; Okada, S. 1971. Freezing resistance of conifers. Silvae Genet. 20(3):91–97.&lt;/ref&gt; given similar states of dormancy.

==== Juvenility ====
[[File:Fagus sylvatica seed 001.jpg|thumb|right|280x|Juvenility in a seedling of [[European beech]].  There is a marked difference in shape between the first dark green "seed leaves" and the lighter second pair of leaves.]]
The organs and tissues produced by a young plant, such as a [[seedling]], are often different from those that are produced by the same plant when it is older.  This phenomenon is known as '''juvenility''' or [[heteroblasty]].  For example, young trees will produce longer, leaner branches that grow upwards more than the branches they will produce as a fully grown tree.  In addition, leaves produced during early growth tend to be larger, thinner, and more irregular than leaves on the adult plant.  Specimens of juvenile plants may look so completely different from adult plants of the same species that egg-laying insects do not recognize the plant as food for their young. 
Differences are seen in rootability and flowering and can be seen in the same mature tree. Juvenile cuttings taken from the base of a tree will form roots much more readily than cuttings originating from the mid to upper crown. Flowering close to the base of a tree is absent or less profuse than flowering in the higher branches especially when a young tree first reaches flowering age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reference Manual of Woody Plant Propagation|publisher=Varsity Press Inc.|isbn=0942375092|pages=26, 28, 29|author=Michael A Dirr|edition=Second|author2=Charles W Heuser, jr.|chapter=2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from early to late growth forms is referred to as '[[vegetative phase change]]',
but there is some disagreement about terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/314215| issn = 1058-5893| volume = 160| issue = S6| pages = –105-S111| last = Jones| first = Cynthia S.| title = An Essay on Juvenility, Phase Change, and Heteroblasty in Seed Plants| journal = International Journal of Plant Sciences| accessdate = 2016-10-16| date = 1999-11-01| url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/314215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern morphology ==

[[Rolf Sattler]] has revised fundamental concepts of comparative morphology such as the concept of [[Homology (biology)|homology]]. He emphasized that homology should also include partial homology and quantitative homology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2418787|last=Sattler|first= R.|year= 1984|title= Homology - a continuing challenge|journal=[[Systematic Botany]]|volume=9|pages= 382–394|doi=10.2307/2418787|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R., 1994, Homology, homeosis, and process morphology in plants. In: B.K. Hall (ed.) ''Homology: The hierarchical basis of comparative morphology''. New York: Academic Press, pp. 423-475.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a continuum morphology that demonstrates a continuum between the morphological categories of root, shoot, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome), and hair (trichome). How intermediates between the categories are best described has been discussed by Bruce K. Kirchoff et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages= 103–122|doi=10.5167/uzh-11204|
last1=Kirchoff|first1= B K|last2= Pfeifer|first2= E|last3= Rutishauser|first3= R |title= Plant structure ontology: How should we label plant structures with doubtful or mixed identities? |journal=Zootaxa|volume= 1950|year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study conducted by Stalk Institute extracted coordinates corresponding to each plant's base and leaves in 3D space. When plants on the graph were placed according to their actual nutrient travel distances and total branch lengths, the plants fell almost perfectly on the Pareto curve. "This means the way plants grow their architectures also optimizes a very common network design tradeoff. Based on the environment and the species, the plant is selecting different ways to make tradeoffs for those particular environmental conditions." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages= 103–122|doi=10.1016/j.cels.2017.06.017|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honoring Agnes Arber, author of the [[Agnes Arber|partial-shoot theory of the leaf]], Rutishauser and Isler called the continuum approach Fuzzy Arberian Morphology (FAM). “Fuzzy” refers to [[fuzzy logic]], “Arberian” to [[Agnes Arber]]. Rutishauser and Isler emphasized that this approach is not only supported by many morphological data but also by evidence from molecular genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.systbot.uzh.ch/static/personen/rolf_rutishauser_assets/Rut_Isl_AnnBot_2001.pdf|doi=10.1006/anbo.2001.1498|title=Developmental Genetics and Morphological Evolution of Flowering Plants, Especially Bladderworts (Utricularia): Fuzzy Arberian Morphology Complements Classical Morphology|year=2001|last1=Rutishauser|first1=Rolf|first2=
Brigitte |last2=Isler|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=88|issue=6|pages=1173–1202}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent evidence from molecular genetics provides further support for continuum morphology. James (2009) concluded that "it is now widely accepted that... radiality [characteristic of most shoots] and dorsiventrality [characteristic of leaves] are but extremes of a continuous spectrum. In fact, it is simply the timing of the KNOX gene expression!."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P. J. | year = 2009 | title = 'Tree and Leaf': A different angle | url = | journal = The Linnean | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 13–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eckardt and Baum (2010) concluded that "it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2929115|pages=2131–2140.|year=2010|last1=Eckardt|first1=NA|last2=Baum|first2=D|title=The Podostemad Puzzle: The Evolution of Unusual Morphology in the Podostemaceae|volume=22|issue=7|doi=10.1105/tpc.110.220711|journal=The Plant Cell|pmid=20647343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Process morphology (dynamic morphology) describes and analyzes the dynamic continuum of plant form. According to this approach, structures do not ''have'' process(es), they ''are'' process(es).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages= 708–714|doi=10.1139/b92-091|title= Process morphology: Structural dynamics in development and evolution|year= 1992|last1= Sattler|first1= Rolf|journal= Canadian Journal of Botany|volume= 70|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1023936102602 |pages= 261–264 |year=2003 |last1=Vergara-Silva| first1=Francisco |title=Plants and the Conceptual Articulation of Evolutionary Developmental Biology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=18 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the structure/process dichotomy is overcome by "an enlargement of our concept of 'structure' so as to include and recognize that in the living organism it is not merely a question of spatial structure with an 'activity' as something over or against it, but that the concrete organism is a [[spatio-temporal pattern|spatio-''temporal'' structure]] and that this spatio-temporal structure is the activity itself."&lt;ref&gt;Woodger,  J.H. 1967. ''Biological Principles''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegoan Paul (reissued with a new Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jeune, Barabé and Lacroix, classical morphology (that is, mainstream morphology, based on a qualitative homology concept implying mutually exclusive categories) and continuum morphology are sub-classes of the more encompassing process morphology (dynamic morphology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=277–293|pmid=17486414|year=2006|last1=Jeune|first1=B|last2=Barabé|first2=D|last3=Lacroix|first3=C|title=Classical and dynamic morphology: Toward a synthesis through the space of forms|volume=54|issue=4|doi=10.1007/s10441-007-9007-8|journal=Acta Biotheoretica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical morphology, continuum morphology, and process morphology are highly relevant to plant evolution, especially the field of plant evolutionary biology (plant evo-devo) that tries to integrate plant morphology and plant molecular genetics. In a detailed case study on unusual morphologies, Rutishauser (2016) illustrated and discussed various topics of plant evo-devo such as the fuzziness (continuity) of morphological concepts, the lack of a one-to-one correspondence between structural categories and gene expression, the notion of morphospace, the adaptive value of bauplan features versus patio ludens, physiological adaptations, hopeful monsters and saltational evolution, the significance and limits of developmental robustness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/aob/mcv172|title=Evolution of unusual morphologies in Lentibulariaceae (bladderworts and allies) and Podostemonaceae (river-weeds): a pictorial report at the interface of developmental biology and morphological diversification|year=2016|last1=Rutishauser|first1=Rolf|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=117|pages=811-832|pmc=4845801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[postpartum period]] (less commonly, puerperium or puerperal period) begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=/PHN/PHN12_03/S1368980008002152a.pdf&amp;code=3ba0290fddc1bb0d50aadfcbedad50cd |title=Effect of Alcohol consumption on Maternal lactation characteristics during ‘doing-the-month’ ritual |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, up to 40 days, two months or 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1021145/confinement-practices-an-overview|title=Confinement practices: an overview|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postnatal recuperation can include "traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tung|first1=Wei-Chen|title=Doing the Month and Asian Cultures: Implications for Health Care|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=22 June 2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=369–371|doi=10.1177/1084822310367473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice used to be known as "[[lying-in]]", which, as the term suggests, centres around [[bed rest]].

The custom is well-documented in China, where it is known as "Sitting the month". Japanese women know it as "''Sango no hidachi''" and Koreans as "''Samchilil''", which means "thirty-one". In Latin American countries it is called ''la cuarentena'', i.e. "forty days" (the source of the English word "[[quarantine]]"). In India it is called ''jaappa'' (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''japa'').

==Commonalities and benefits==
[[File:Breastfeeding-7.jpg|thumb|A mother breastfeeds her infant while another woman gives support.]]
Postpartum confinement refers both to the mother and the baby. Human [[newborn]]s are so underdeveloped that pediatricians such as [[Harvey Karp]] refer to the first three months as the "fourth trimester"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/24/155426534/dr-karp-on-parenting-and-the-science-of-sleep|title=Dr. Karp On Parenting And The Science Of Sleep|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=National Public Radio|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|department=All Things Considered|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The weeks of rest while the mother heals also protect the infant as [[Adaptation to extrauterine life|it adjusts to the world]], and both learn the skills of [[breastfeeding]].

A 2016 American book describes the difficulties of documenting these "global grandmotherly customs" but asserts that "like a golden rope connecting women from one generation to the next, the protocol of caring for the new mother by unburdening her of responsibilities and ensuring she rests and eats shows up in wildly diverse places"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ou|first1=Heng|last2=Amely|first2=Greeven|last3=Belger|first3=Marisa|title=The First Forty Days: The Essential Art of Nourishing the New Mother|date=2016|isbn=9781617691836}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One meta-review of studies concluded, "There is little consistent evidence that confinement practices reduce postpartum depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Josephine|last2=Fisher|first2=Jane|title=The role of traditional confinement practices in determining postpartum depression in women in Chinese cultures: A systematic review of the English language evidence|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=August 2009|volume=116|issue=3|pages=161–169|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2008.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all countries have some form of [[maternity leave]]. Many countries encourage men to take some [[paternity leave]], but even those that mandate that some of the shared [[parental leave]] must be used by the father ("[[father's quota]]") acknowledge that the mother needs time off work to recover from the childbirth and deal with the [[postpartum physiological changes]].

The custom, going back to the year 960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/i-tried-the-chinese-practice-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth/2017/01/06/54517ee0-ad0b-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html|title=I tried the Chinese practice of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|last=Hsu Oh|first=Leslie|date=8 January 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is referred to as 'confinement' as women are advised to stay indoors for recovery from the trauma of birth and feed the newborn baby. Aspects of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are included, with a special focus on eating foods considered to be nourishing for the body and help with the production of [[breastmilk]]. In [[Guangdong]] and neighboring regions, new mothers are barred from visitors until the baby is 12 days old, marked by a celebration called 'Twelve mornings' (known as 十二朝). From this day onwards, Cantonese families with a new baby usually share their joy through giving away food gifts, while some families mark the occasion by [[Ancestor veneration in China|paying tribute to their ancestors]]. 

In [[ancient China]], women of certain ethnic groups in the South would resume work right after birth, and allow the men to practice postpartum confinement instead.&lt;ref&gt;《[[太平廣記]]》卷四八三引[[尉遲樞]]的《[[南楚新聞]]》記載："南方有[[仡佬族|獠婦]]，生子便起。其夫臥床褥，飲食皆如乳婦。"《[[马可·波罗游记]]》："[[傣族]]妇女产子，洗后裹以襁褓，产妇立起工作，产妇之夫则抱子卧床四十日"；《黔记》卷二：郎慈苗在咸宁州，其俗更异，妇人产子，必夫守房，不逾门户，弥月乃出。产妇则出入耕作，措饭食，以供夫乳儿，日无暇刻。"&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Couvade]].)

=== Everyday habits and personal hygiene practices ===
During confinement, mothers are told not to expose their body to physical agents such cold weather or wind, as these are claimed to be detrimental to their recovery. Specifically, mothers were traditionally not allowed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgmmbb.com/chanhou/zyz/092M0T2010.html 坐月子能洗头吗?坐月子洗头对身体有什么影响？]&lt;/ref&gt; to have any contact with water (e.g. bathing or washing hair), to exert themselves by climbing stairs, to read books or cry, to sew, or to have sex. 

Nowadays, however, new mothers may wash their hair or take a bath or shower infrequently during the postpartum period, but it is claimed to be important to dry their body immediately afterwards with a clean towel and their hair properly using a hair dryer. It is also claimed to be important for women to wrap up warm and minimize the amount of skin exposed, as it was believed that they may catch a cold during this vulnerable time.

=== Special foods ===
[[File:Pig_feet_ginger.jpg|thumb|Pork knuckle with ginger and black vinegar]]
The custom of confinement advises new mothers to choose energy and protein-rich foods to recover energy levels, help shrink the [[uterus]] and for the [[perineum]] to heal. This is also important for the production of [[Breast milk|breastmilk]]. Sometimes, new mothers only begin to consume special herbal foods after all the [[lochia]] is discharged.

A common dish is [[Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew|pork knuckles with ginger and black vinegar]] as pork knuckles are believed to help replenish calcium levels in the women. Ginger is featured in many dishes, as it is believed that it can remove the 'wind' accumulated in the body during pregnancy. Meat-based soup broths are also commonly consumed to provide hydration and added nutrients. Although not entirely backed by scientific evidence, for example, fish and papaya soup is considered to help produce breastmilk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1023191/milk-booster-fish-and-papaya-soup|title=Milk booster: fish and papaya soup|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other East Asian countries==
Other [[East Asian]] cultures, such as [[South Korean culture|South Korean]] and [[Vietnamese culture|Vietnamese]], have their own versions of "sitting the month", combining prescribed foods with proscribed activities. Similar practices are popular among Japanese women called 産後の肥立ち "''Sango no hidachi''" and Korean women called 삼칠일 "''Samchilil''" for at least 21 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/korean-postpartum-rituals-21-days.html|title=Little Seouls Blog: Korean Postpartum Rituals 삼칠일 (21 days)|website=littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new mother is given special postnatal foods, such as [[Miyeokguk|seaweed soup]] in Korea. ''Samchilil'' is practiced in addition to other traditions encompassed in [[sanhujori]], which is Korea's version of postnatal care. During this period of time that could extend beyond the 21 days, women followed principles that emphasize activities and foods that keep the body warm, rest and relaxation to maximize the body’s return to its normal state, maintaining cleanliness, eating nutritious foods, and peace of mind and heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jeongeun|date=March 2003|title=Survey on the Programs ofSanhujoriCenters in Korea as the Traditional Postpartum Care Facilities|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1300%2FJ013v38n02_08|journal=Women &amp; Health|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=107–117|doi=10.1300/j013v38n02_08|issn=0363-0242}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Thailand ''yu-fai'' ("lie down by a fire") treatment is traditional postpartum healing. Performed in an open area, it involves using smokeless tamarind wood, local herbs and massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Lie down by a fire |url=http://bangkokpost.com/multimedia/vdo/thailand/427374/lie-down-by-a-fire  |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]]|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Most traditional Indians follow the 40-day confinement and recuperation period also known as the ''jaappa'' (in Hindi). A special diet to facilitate milk production and increase hemoglobin levels is followed. Sex is not allowed during this time. In Hindu culture, this time after childbirth was traditionally considered a period of relative impurity (''asaucham''), and a period of confinement of 10–40 days (known as ''purudu'') was recommended for the mother and the baby. During this period, she was exempted from usual household chores and religious rites. The father was [[ritual purification|purified by a ritual bath]] before visiting the mother in confinement. 

In the event of a stillbirth, the period of impurity for both parents was 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Marshall / Jaya Tirtha Charan Dasa |url=http://www.hknet.org.nz/asaucham-info.htm |title=GUIDE TO RITUAL IMPURITY - What to do at the junctions of birth and death |publisher=Hknet.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Indian subcultures have their own traditions after birth. This birth period is called Virdi (Marathi), which lasts for 10 days after birth and includes complete abstinence from ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' or temple visits.

==Latin America==
The ''cuarantena'' (literally, forty days, also meaning [[quarantine]]) is practised in parts of Latin America, and amongst immigrant communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/04/why_wont_this_new_mom_wash_her_hair.html|title=Why Won't This New Mom Wash Her Hair?|last=Tuhus-Dubrow|first=Rebecca|date=11 April 2011|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as "intergenerational family ritual that facilitated adaptation to parenthood", including some paternal [[role reversal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niska|first1=Kathleen|last2=Snyder|first2=Mariah|last3=Lia-Hoagberg|first3=Betty|title=Family Ritual Facilitates Adaptation to Parenthood|journal=Public Health Nursing|date=October 1998|volume=15|issue=5|pages=329–337|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1446.1998.tb00357.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European cultures==
{{Main|Lying-in}}
[[File:4 Master of Charles of Durazzo (Francesco di Michele) A Birth Scene (Desco da Parte), c. 1410 Harvard Art museum (2).jpg|thumb|A mother in [[Florence]] lying-in, from a painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' or birth tray of c. 1410. As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving.]]
The term used in English, now old-fashioned or [[archaism|archaic]], was once used to name [[maternity hospital]]s, for example the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] in London. A 1932 Canadian publication refers to lying-in as ranging from two weeks to two months.&lt;ref name="Nusche"&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/675 Lying in by Jan Nusche] quoting ''The Bride's Book — A Perpetual Guide for the Montreal Bride'', published in 1932&lt;/ref&gt; These weeks ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. 

Lying-in features in [[Christian art]], notably ''[[Nativity of Christ in art|Birth of Jesus]]'' paintings. One of the gifts presented to the new mother in Renaisssance Florence was a ''[[desco da parto]]'', a special form of painted tray.

== Modern commercial versions ==
Traditionally, women were taken care of by their elders: their mother, mother-in-law, sister, or aunt. The lying-in hospitals provided an institutional variation which gave women weeks of bedrest and a respite from household chores.

Increasingly, these older women are unavailable or unwilling to take on this role; given the lingering effects of the [[one-child policy]], many older Chinese women had limited experience of newborn babies, having only had one themselves. Replacements for this familial help are commercial services, both in the home and at residential centres. 

Agencies provide specialist carers that come to the new parents' home. This job used to be known as the [[monthly nurse]], as she came and lived with the family for a month. Now more common terms are maternity nurse, newborn care specialist, or [[Nanny#maternity_nurse.2FNewborn_Care_Specialists.2FConfinement_Nanny|confinement nanny]]; the worker is not a registered health care professional such as the word "[[nurse]]" usually implies in current English. In [[Indian English]] the role is called a "''japa'' maid". A [[doula]] is best known as a birth companion, but some provide practical and emotional post-birth support. A [[lactation consultant]] and a [[health visitor]] are trained health professionals who may assist the new mother at this time. In the Netherlands, the in-home support is known as ''[[kraamzorg]]''.

The use of ''yue sao'', a specialist carer translated in Canada as "postpartum doula",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quan|first1=Douglas|title=Underground industry serves moms who follow Chinese custom of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/buyer-beware-underground-industry-serves-moms-who-follow-chinese-custom-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth|accessdate=28 October 2017|publisher=National Post|date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also very common in China. ''Yue Sao'' typically are live-in domestic helpers who care for both the new mother and baby for the first month after birth. Salaries as at 2017 vary from RMB8000 to RMB20000 per month depending on city and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://www.ayicheng.com/yue-sao-baby-china-blog/?lang=en|title= Yue Sao|website= Ayicheng|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as "mothering the mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ownyourbirth|url=https://www.ownyourbirth.ca/single-post/2017/11/07/Zuo-Yue-Zi-%E5%9D%90%E6%9C%88-Sitting-the-Month|website=ownyourbirth|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Australian documentary-maker [[Aela Callan]] called them "Chinese supermums" but says they are colloquially known as "confinement ladies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Supermums|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/chinas-supermums|website=News|publisher=[[SBS (Australian TV channel)]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Companies have sprung up to offer extended postpartum care outside the home, sometimes in a hotel-like environment. Luxury options are big business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where a new baby means relaxation|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/babies/where-a-new-baby-means-relaxation/news-story/b5ebe958a84a9c6e560883a073e94730|website=NewsComAu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private postpartum care centres were introduced to Korea in 1996 under the name of ''[[Sanhujori|sanhujoriwon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michiyo|first=Nomura|date=2016|title=A Study on the Continuance and Variation of Korean Traditional Postnatal Care in a Modern Postpartum Care Center|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06723909|journal=The Korean Folklore Society|volume=63|pages=37–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Chinese tradition, specialist businesses such as Red Wall Confinement Centre charge up to $27,000 for one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/international/china-confinement-care-for-new-mothers-now-27000-a-month.html|title= Red Wall Confinement Centre|website=New York Times|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth tourism]] centres operating under the radar in the United States for Chinese women offer "sitting the month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ni|first1=Ching-Ching|title='Birthing tourism' center in San Gabriel shut down|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/25/local/la-me-birthing-center-20110325|accessdate=14 April 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates was inspired by the documentary ''[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests|title=A Radical Attempt to Save the Reefs and Forests|work=The New Yorker|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-04-18|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied biology at [[Newcastle University]] where she earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She fell in love with corals during a diving trip to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/20-for-the-next-20-2016/|title=20 for the Next 20: 2016|date=2016-03-03|work=Hawaii Business Magazine|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 she moved to the [[West Indies]] to study corals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She completed her [[PhD]] at [[Newcastle University]] in 1989 on seawater temperature and [[algal]]-[[cnidaria]]n [[symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=gatesphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/18918380?style=html|title=Seawater temperature and algal-cnidarian symbiosis|first= Ruth Deborah|last=Gates|date=1989|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.346445}}|website=jisc.ac.uk|oclc=557254204}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career and research==
After her PhD, Gates was appointed a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She spent thirteen years working as a junior researcher in California. She was there during the 1998 [[bleaching event]] that killed more than 15 % of corals across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gates joined the [[Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology]] 2003.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates {{!}} Tetiaroa Society|website=www.tetiaroasociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied corals and reefs, learning how they function and working on ways to slow their decline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She worked on [[Coconut Island]], trying to identify why some corals survive bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/03/corals-ocean-temperature/|title=Some Corals May Adapt to Warming Seas|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her group monitored the ecosystems of coral reefs to understand how a changing environment impacted coral health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/monitoring-reefs|title=Monitoring Reefs|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corals in shallow patches like [[Kāneʻohe Bay]] are subject to high temperatures and irradiance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alongside seawater temperature, they measure photosynthetic active radiation, salinity and nutrient composition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This allowed them to build [[3D modeling|3D models]] of reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheJohnburns84|title=Ke'ei|date=2015-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZLu7wByKY&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They study the [[symbiodinium]] that live within coral tissues.

'''Sexual dysfunction''' (or '''sexual malfunction''' or '''sexual disorder''') is difficulty experienced by an individual or a couple during any stage of a normal [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], including physical pleasure, [[Sexual desire|desire]], preference, [[sexual arousal|arousal]] or [[orgasm]]. According to the [[DSM-5]], sexual dysfunction requires a person to feel extreme distress and [[interpersonal]] strain for a minimum of six months (excluding substance or medication-induced sexual dysfunction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolen-Hoeksema|first=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=2 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10121|isbn=978-1-259-06072-4|pages=366–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual dysfunctions can have a profound impact on an individual's perceived quality of sexual life.&lt;ref name= "eden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eden K.J., Wylie K.R. | year = 2009 | title = Quality of sexual life and menopause | url = | journal = Women's Health | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 385–396 | doi = 10.2217/whe.09.24 | pmid = 19586430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexual disorder'' may not only refer to physical sexual dysfunction, but to [[paraphilia]]s as well; this is sometimes termed ''disorder of sexual preference''.

A thorough sexual history and assessment of general health and other sexual problems (if any) are very important. Assessing performance [[anxiety]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[worry]] are integral to the optimal management of sexual dysfunction. Many of the sexual dysfunctions that are defined are based on the [[human sexual response cycle]], proposed by [[Masters and Johnson|William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson]], and then modified by [[Helen Singer Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=William H. Masters [and] Virginia E.|title=Human sexual inadequacy|date=1970|publisher=Churchill|location=London|isbn=978-0700001934|edition=2. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Helen Singer|title=The new sex therapy; active treatment of sexual dysfunctions.|date=1974|publisher=Brunner/Mazel|location=New York|isbn=978-0876300831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Sexual dysfunction disorders may be classified into four categories: [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder|sexual desire disorders]], [[sexual arousal disorder|arousal disorders]], [[Anorgasmia|orgasm disorders]] and [[sexual pain disorder|pain disorders]].

===Sexual desire disorders===
{{Main|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder}}
Sexual desire disorders or decreased [[libido]] are characterized by a lack or absence for some period of time of [[sexual desire]] or [[libido]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or of [[sexual fantasies]]. The condition ranges from a general lack of sexual desire to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. The condition may have started after a period of normal sexual functioning or the person may always have had no or low sexual desire.

The causes vary considerably, but include a possible decrease in the production of normal [[estrogen]] in women or [[testosterone]] in both men and women. Other causes may be aging, fatigue, pregnancy, medications (such as the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]) or psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. While a number of causes for low sexual desire are often cited, only some of these have ever been the object of empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice, William (2007): "Sexual Desire Disorders in Men." in ed. Leiblum, Sandra:  ''Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy'' (4th ed.)  The Guilford Press.  New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual arousal disorders===
{{main|Sexual arousal disorder}}
Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as [[Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigidity]] in women and [[impotence]] in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as [[erectile dysfunction]], and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'': lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hartley H | year = 2006 | title = The 'pinking' of Viagra culture: Drug industry efforts to create and repackage sex drugs for women | doi = 10.1177/1363460706065058 | journal = Sexualities | volume = 9 | issue = 3| page = 365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner. In men, there may be partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection, or a lack of sexual excitement and pleasure in sexual activity.

There may be physiological origins to these disorders, such as decreased blood flow or lack of vaginal lubrication. Chronic disease can also contribute, as well as the nature of the relationship between the partners.

Additionally, the condition postorgasm illness syndrome (POIS) may cause symptoms when aroused, including adrenergic-type presentation; rapid breathing, paraesthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness and fatigue.

From the onset of arousal, symptoms can persist for up to a week in patients.

The aetiology of this condition is unknown, however it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the NIH but the prevalence is unknown.  It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and thus may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.&lt;ref name="rarediseases.info.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome &amp;#124; Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erectile dysfunction===
{{Main|Erectile dysfunction}}
Erectile dysfunction or impotence is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis. There are various underlying causes, such as damage to the [[nervi erigentes]] which prevents or delays erection, or diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease, which simply decreases blood flow to the tissue in the penis, many of which are medically reversible.

The causes of erectile dysfunction may be psychological or physical. Psychological erectile dysfunction can often be helped by almost anything that the patient believes in; there is a very strong placebo effect. Physical damage is much more severe. One leading physical cause of ED is continual or severe damage taken to the nervi erigentes. These nerves course beside the prostate arising from the sacral plexus and can be damaged in prostatic and colorectal surgeries.

Diseases are also common causes of erectile dysfunctional; especially in men. Diseases such as cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, kidney failure, vascular disease and spinal cord injury are the source of erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). Sexual Dysfnctions. In Abnormal Psychology. McGraw Hill Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its embarrassing nature and the shame felt by sufferers, the subject was taboo for a long time, and is the subject of many urban legends. Folk remedies have long been advocated, with some being advertised widely since the 1930s. The introduction of perhaps the first pharmacologically effective remedy for impotence, [[sildenafil]] (trade name Viagra), in the 1990s caused a wave of public attention, propelled in part by the news-worthiness of stories about it and heavy advertising.

It is estimated that around 30 million men in the United States and 152 million men worldwide suffer from erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = NIH. Consensus Development Panel on Impotence.| year = 1993 | title = Impotence | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 83–90 | doi=10.1001/jama.270.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayta I, Mckinlay J, Krane R | year = 1999 | title = The likely worldwide increase in erectile dysfunction between 1995 and 2025 | url = | journal = BJU Int | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 50–56 | doi=10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.00142.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, social stigma, low health literacy and social taboos lead to under reporting which makes an accurate prevalence rate hard to determine.

The Latin term [[impotentia coeundi]] describes simple inability to insert the [[penis]] into the [[vagina]]. It is now mostly replaced by more precise terms.

===Premature ejaculation===
{{Main|Premature ejaculation}}

Premature ejaculation is when ejaculation occurs before the partner achieves orgasm, or a mutually satisfactory length of time has passed during intercourse. There is no correct length of time for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under two minutes from the time of the insertion of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger M.D., Berenden H.H., Blok B.F., et al. ''Premature Ejaculation and Serotengeric Anti-depressants - Induced Delayed Ejaculation: The Involvement of the Serotonergic System.'' Behavioural Brain Res. 1998;92(2): 111-118&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagnosis, the patient must have a chronic history of premature ejaculation, poor ejaculatory control, and the problem must cause feelings of dissatisfaction as well as distress the patient, the partner or both.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz V.A. &amp; Close J.D. ''Male Sexual Dysfunction'' Primary Care 2010;37(3): 473 - 489.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically attributed to psychological causes, new theories suggest that premature ejaculation may have an underlying neurobiological cause which may lead to rapid ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;Lauman E.O., Nicolosi, A., Glasser D.B., et al. ''Sexual Problems among women and men aged 40 to 80 years: Prevalence and Correlates Identified in a GLobal Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviours.'' International Journal of Impotence Research. 2005;7(1): 39 - 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgasm disorders===
{{Main|Anorgasmia}}
Orgasm disorders, specifically anorgasmia, present as persistent delays or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in at least 75% of sexual encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-259-06072-4|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins. [[SSRI]] antidepressants are a common pharmaceutical culprit, as they can delay orgasm or eliminate it entirely. A common physiological culprit of anorgasmia is [[Sexual dysfunction#menopause|menopause]], where one in three women report problems obtaining an orgasm during sexual stimulation following menopause.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan. "Abnormal Psychology". McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages; 6 Edition, 2013. p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to this there are what is called post-orgasm disorders, which would better categorise the condition: postorgasm illness syndrome (see post-orgasm disorders section).

===Sexual pain disorders===
Sexual pain disorders affect women almost exclusively and are also known as [[dyspareunia]] (painful intercourse) or [[vaginismus]] (an involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).

Dyspareunia may be caused by insufficient lubrication ([[vaginal dryness]]) in women. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by [[menopause]], [[pregnancy]], or breastfeeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sex.

It is unclear exactly what causes vaginismus, but it is thought that past sexual trauma (such as [[rape]] or [[Domestic violence|abuse]]) may play a role. Another female sexual pain disorder is called [[vulvodynia]] or [[vulvar vestibulitis]]. In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex which seems to be related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. The cause is unknown.

===Post-orgasmic diseases===
Post-orgasmic diseases cause symptoms shortly after [[orgasm]] or [[ejaculation]]. [[Post-coital tristesse]] (PCT) is a feeling of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]] and [[anxiety]] after sexual intercourse that lasts for up to two hours. [[Sexual headache]]s occur in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation, arousal or orgasm.

In men, [[postorgasmic illness syndrome]] (POIS) causes severe [[myalgia|muscle pain]] throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following [[ejaculation]]. The symptoms last for up to a week.&lt;ref name=Balon2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Sexual Dysfunction | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |veditors=Balon R, Segraves RT | year=2005 | isbn=9780824758264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH64CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Post%20orgaasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Post-orgasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;f=false | title=ABC of Sexual Health | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2015 | pages=75 | isbn=9781118665565 | editor=Wylie KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GARD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome | encyclopedia=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) | publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | year=2015 | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome/resources/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS "in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature",&lt;ref name=Ashby2010&gt;{{cite journal | title=Postorgasm illness syndrome--a spectrum of illnesses. |vauthors=Ashby J, Goldmeier D | journal=J. Sex. Med. |date=May 2010  | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=1976–81 | doi= 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01707.x| pmid=20214722}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many POIS sufferers are undiagnosed.&lt;ref name=McMahon2014&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.statusplus.net/issm/saopaulo2014/presentations/082.pdf | title=Post-Orgasmic Illness Syndrome | author=McMahon CG | journal=16th World Meeting on Sexual Medicine |date=October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptomology of POIS may present as adrenergic-type presentation; rapid breathing, paraesthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness and fatigue.

From the onset of orgasm, symptoms can persist for up to a week in patients.

The aetiology of this condition is unknown, however it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the NIH but the prevalence is unknown.  It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and thus may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.&lt;ref name="rarediseases.info.nih.gov"/&gt;

[[Dhat Syndrome]] is another condition which occurs in men. It is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] which causes anxious and dysphoric mood after sex, but is distinct from the low-mood and concentration problems (acute aphasia) seen in postorgasm illness syndrome.

===Pelvic floor dysfunction===
{{Main|Pelvic floor dysfunction}}
Pelvic floor dysfunction can be an underlying cause of sexual dysfunction in both women and men, and is treatable by physical therapy.&lt;ref name="malepelvicfloor.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://malepelvicfloor.com/sd.html | title=Male Pelvic Floor: Advanced Massage and Bodywork}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = | year = 2008 | title = The Role of Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy in the Treatment of Pelvic and Genital Pain-Related Sexual Dysfunction | url = | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 513–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncommon sexual disorders in men===
Erectile dysfunction from [[vascular disease]] is usually seen only amongst [[old age|elderly]] individuals who have [[atherosclerosis]]. Vascular disease is common in individuals who have [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[hypertension]] and those who smoke. Any time [[blood flow]] to the penis is impaired, erectile dysfunction is the end result.

[[Hormone]] deficiency is a relatively rare cause of erectile dysfunction. In individuals with testicular failure like in [[Klinefelter syndrome]], or those who have had [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]] or childhood exposure to [[mumps virus]], the testes may fail and not produce testosterone. Other hormonal causes of erectile failure include brain tumors, [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]] or disorders of the [[adrenal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip_300/381_love_tip.html Strange sexual disorders] Ask Men. Retrieved on February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural abnormalities of the penis like [[Peyronie's disease]] can make sexual intercourse difficult. The disease is characterized by thick fibrous bands in the penis which leads to a deformed-looking penis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangesexualdisorders.com/ Analysis of abnormal sexual disturbances] 2010-02-18{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugs are also a cause of erectile dysfunction. Individuals who take drugs to lower [[blood pressure]] or use [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, sedatives, narcotics, antacids or alcohol can have problems with sexual function and loss of libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=A |last2=Chaudhry |first2=M |last3=Elewski |first3=B |title=Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra |journal=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=21 |pages=395–400, v |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S0733-8635(03)00031-7 |pmid=12956194 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priapism]] is a painful erection that occurs for several hours and occurs in the absence of [[sexual stimulation]]. This condition develops when blood gets trapped in the penis and is unable to drain out. If the condition is not promptly treated, it can lead to severe scarring and permanent loss of erectile function. The disorder occurs in young men and children. Individuals with [[sickle-cell disease]] and those who abuse certain medications can often develop this disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777603-overview Priapism in Emergency Medicine], [[eMedicine]].

==Causes==

There are many factors which may result in a person experiencing a sexual dysfunction. These may result from emotional or physical causes. Emotional factors include interpersonal or psychological problems, which can be the result of [[clinical depression|depression]], sexual fears or guilt, past sexual trauma, and sexual disorders,&lt;ref name="Michetti_et_al_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michetti |first1=P M |last2=Rossi |first2=R |last3=Bonanno |first3=D |last4=Tiesi |first4=A |last5=Simonelli |first5=C |title=Male sexuality and regulation of emotions: a study on the association between alexithymia and erectile dysfunction (ED) |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=170–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16151475 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901386}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Sexual dysfunction is especially common among people who have [[anxiety disorders]]. Ordinary anxiousness can obviously cause erectile dysfunction in men without psychiatric problems, but clinically diagnosable disorders such as [[panic disorder]] commonly cause avoidance of intercourse and premature ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astrokapoor.com/ask/premature-ejaculation-treatment@60.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pain during intercourse is often a comorbidity of anxiety disorders among women.&lt;ref name="Coretti"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Coretti G, Baldi I|title=The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and Sexual Dysfunction |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=9 |date=August 1, 2007|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/article/10168/54881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical factors that can lead to sexual dysfunctions include the use of drugs, such as alcohol, [[nicotine]], [[narcotic]]s, stimulants, [[antihypertensive drug|antihypertensives]], [[antihistamine]]s, and some psychotherapeutic drugs.&lt;ref name="Saks"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Saks BR|title=Common issues in female sexual dysfunction |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=5 |date=April 15, 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/sexual-issues/article/10168/1153918}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women, almost any physiological change that affects the reproductive system—[[premenstrual syndrome]], pregnancy and the postpartum period, menopause—can have an adverse effect on libido.&lt;ref name="Saks"/&gt; Injuries to the back may also impact sexual activity, as can problems with an enlarged prostate gland, problems with blood supply, or nerve damage (as in [[sexuality after spinal cord injury|sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injuries]]). Diseases such as [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[tumor]]s, and, rarely, tertiary [[syphilis]] may also impact the activity, as could the failure of various organ systems (such as the heart and lungs), [[endocrine]] disorders ([[thyroid]], [[pituitary]], or [[adrenal gland]] problems), hormonal deficiencies (low [[testosterone]], other [[androgen]]s, or [[estrogen]]) and some [[birth defect]]s.

Pelvic floor dysfunction is also a physical and underlying cause of many sexual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="malepelvicfloor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pelvicpainhelp.com/pelvic-floor-dysfunction/ | title=Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Perineum Pain, Sore Pelvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.beyondbasicsphysicaltherapy.com/sexual-dysfunction | title=Sexual Dysfunction &amp;#124; Beyond Basics Physical Therapy &amp;#124; New York City, Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2746737 | pmid=18448734 | doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816bbe85 | volume=111 | issue=5 | title=Female sexual function and pelvic floor disorders | author=Handa VL, Cundiff G, Chang HH, Helzlsouer KJ | journal=Obstet Gynecol | pages=1045–52| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of heterosexual relationships, one of the main reasons for the decline in sexual activity among these couples is the male partner experiencing erectile dysfunction. This can be very distressing for the male partner, causing poor body image, and it can also be a major source of low desire for these men.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; In aging women, it is natural for the vagina to [[Menopause#Urogenital atrophy|narrow and become atrophied]]. If a woman has not been participating in sexual activity regularly (in particular,  activities involving vaginal penetration) with her partner, if she does decide to engage in penetrative intercourse, she will not be able to immediately accommodate a penis without risking pain or injury.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; This can turn into a vicious cycle, often leading to female sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

According to Emily Wentzell, American culture has anti-aging sentiments that have caused sexual dysfunction to become "an illness that needs treatment" instead of viewing it as the natural part of the aging process it is. Not all cultures seek treatment; for example, a population of men living in Mexico often accept erectile dysfunction as a normal part of their maturing sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wentzell|first1=Emily|title=Aging Respectably by Rejecting Medicalization: Mexican Men's Reasons for Not Using Erectile Dysfunction Drugs|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|date=2013|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1111/maq.12013|pmid=23674320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female sexual dysfunction===

Several theories have looked at female sexual dysfunction, from medical to psychological perspectives. Three social psychological theories include: the self-perception theory, the overjustification hypothesis, and the insufficient justification hypothesis:

*Self-perception theory: people make attributions about their own attitudes, feelings, and behaviours by relying on their observations of external behaviours and the circumstances in which those behaviours occur
*Overjustification hypothesis: when an external reward is given to a person for performing an intrinsically rewarding activity, the person's intrinsic interest will decrease
*Insufficient justification: based on the classic [[cognitive dissonance]] theory (inconsistency between two cognitions or between a cognition and a behavior will create discomfort), this theory states that people will alter one of the cognitions or behaviours to restore consistency and reduce distress

The importance of how a woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore as opposed to a pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

About one third of the women experienced sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/sexual_dysfunction_in_women/overview_of_sexual_dysfunction_in_women.html | title=Overview of Sexual Dysfunction in Women - Women's Health Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menopause===
The female sexual response system is complex and even today, not fully understood. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions that have been linked to menopause include lack of desire and libido; these are predominantly associated with hormonal physiology.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Specifically, it is the decline in serum estrogens that causes these changes in sexual functioning. Androgen depletion may also play a role, but currently this is less clear. The hormonal changes that take place during the menopausal transition have been suggested to affect women's sexual response through several mechanisms, some more conclusive than others.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

===Aging in women===
Whether or not aging directly affects women's sexual functioning during menopause is another area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically in the areas of desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm.&lt;ref name= "eden"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laumann Edward O., Paik Anthony, Rosen Raymond C. | year = 1999 | title = Sexual Dysfunction in the United States: Prevalence and Predictors | url = | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 281 | issue = 6| pages = 537–44 | doi=10.1001/jama.281.6.537 | pmid=10022110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; This means that it is important to understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on quality of life is often underestimated.

Testosterone, along with its metabolite dihydrotestosterone, is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women.&lt;ref name= "king"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kingsberg S.A. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of aging on sexual function in women and their partners | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 431–437 | doi=10.1023/A:1019844209233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half of what they were before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

Sexual desire has been related to three separate components: drive, beliefs and values, and motivation.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Particularly in postmenopausal women, drive fades and is no longer the initial step in a woman's sexual response (if it ever was).&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

==List of disorders==

===DSM===
The fourth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] lists the following sexual dysfunctions:

==Treatment==

===Males===
Several decades ago the medical community believed the majority of sexual dysfunction cases were related to psychological issues.  Although this may be true for a portion of men, the vast majority of cases have now been identified as having a physical cause or correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jarow J, Nana-Sinkam P, Sabbagh M | year = 1996 | title = Outcome analysis of goal directed therapy for impotence | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 155 | issue = 5| pages = 1609–1612 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(01)66142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the sexual dysfunction is deemed to have a psychological component or cause, [[psychotherapy]] can help. Situational anxiety arises from an earlier bad incident or lack of experience. This anxiety often leads to development of fear towards sexual activity and avoidance. In return evading leads to a cycle of increased anxiety and [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] of the penis. In some cases, erectile dysfunction may be due to marital disharmony. Marriage [[Relationship counseling|counseling]] sessions are recommended in this situation.

Lifestyle changes such as discontinuing [[smoking]], drug or [[alcohol abuse]] can also help in some types of erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme. [http://www.merck.com/pubs/mmanual_ha/sec3/ch59/ch59a.html "Male genital and sexual disorders"] 2010-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Several oral medications like Viagra, [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] and [[Vardenafil|Levitra]] have become available to help people with erectile dysfunction and have become first line therapy. These medications provide an easy, safe, and effective treatment solution for approximately 60% of men. In the rest, the medications may not work because of wrong diagnosis or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] history.

Another type of medication that is effective in roughly 85% of men is called intracavernous pharmacotherapy and involves injecting a vasodilator drug directly into the penis in order to stimulate an erection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodríguez Vela |first1=L |last2=Moncada Iribarren |first2=I |last3=Gonzalvo Ibarra |first3=A |author4=Sáenz de Tejada y Gorman I |title=Treatment of erectile dysfunction using intracavernous pharmacotherapy |journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=291–319 |year=1998 |pmid=9658642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has an increased risk of [[priapism]] if used in conjunction with other treatments, and localized pain.&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

When conservative therapies fail, are an unsatisfactory treatment option, or are contraindicated for use, the insertion of a [[penile prosthesis]], or penile implant, may be selected by the patient.  Technological advances have made the insertion of a penile prosthesis a safe option for the treatment of erectile dysfunction which provides the highest patient and partner satisfaction rates of all available ED treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rajpurkar A, Dhabuwala C | year = 2003 | title = Comparison of satisfaction rates and erectile function in patients treated with sildenafil, intracavernous prostaglandin E1 and penile implant surgery for erectile dysfunction in urology practice | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 170 | issue = 1| pages = 159–163 | doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000072524.82345.6d| pmid = 12796670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelvic floor physical therapy has been shown to be a valid treatment for men with sexual problems and pelvic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.healpelvicpain.com/about-book | title=About Book &amp;#124; Heal Pelvic Pain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Females===
There are no approved pharmaceuticals for addressing female sexual disorders, although several are under investigation for their effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Amato&gt;Amato P, MD. An update on therapeutic approaches to female sexual dysfunction {{cite web|url=http://www.femalesexualdysfunctiononline.org/commentaries/commentaries.cfm?abs_id%3Dabs_007 |title=Female Sexual Dysfunction Online &amp;#124; A Blog to Document the High's and Low's of My Life |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004092107/http://www.femalesexualdysfunctiononline.org/commentaries/commentaries.cfm?abs_id=abs_007 |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}. 2007. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A vacuum device is the only approved medical device for arousal and orgasm disorders. It is designed to increase blood flow to the clitoris and external genitalia.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt; Women experiencing pain with intercourse are often prescribed pain relievers or desensitizing agents. Others can be prescribed lubricants or hormone therapy.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt;  Many patients with female sexual dysfunction are often also referred to a counselor or therapist for psychosocial counseling.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt;

====Menopause====
Estrogens are responsible for the maintenance of collagen, elastic fibers, and vasoculature of the urogenital tract, all of which are important in maintaining vaginal structure and functional integrity; they are also important for maintaining vaginal pH and moisture levels, both of which aid in keeping the tissues lubricated and protected.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Prolonged estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy, fibrosis, and reduced blood flow to the urogenital tract, which is what causes menopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness and pain related to sexual activity and/or intercourse.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; It has been consistently demonstrated that women with lower sexual functioning have lower estradiol levels.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

Androgen therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) has a small benefit but its safety is not known.&lt;ref name=Wri2015/&gt; It is not approved as a treatment in the United States.&lt;ref name=Wri2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=JJ|last2=O'Connor|first2=KM|title=Female sexual dysfunction.|journal=The Medical Clinics of North America|date=May 2015|volume=99|issue=3|pages=607–28|pmid=25841603|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2015.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If used it is more common among women who have had an oophorectomy or who are in a postmenopausal state. However, like most treatments, this is also controversial. One study found that after a 24-week trial, those women taking androgens had higher scores of sexual desire compared to a placebo group.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; As with all pharmacological drugs, there are side effects in using androgens, which include hirutism, acne, ploycythaemia, increased high-density lipoproteins, cardiovascular risks, and endometrial hyperplasia is a possibility in women without hysterectomy.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Alternative treatments include topical estrogen creams and gels can be applied to the vulva or vagina area to treat vaginal dryness and atrophy.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

==Clinical studies==
In modern times, the genuine clinical study of sexual problems is usually dated back no further than 1970 when [[William Masters and Virginia Johnson|Masters and Johnson's]] ''[[Human Sexual Inadequacy]]'' was published. It was the result of over a decade of work at the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St. Louis, involving 790 cases. The work grew from Masters and Johnson's earlier ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'' (1966).

Prior to Masters and Johnson the clinical approach to sexual problems was largely derived from the thinking of [[Freud]]. It was held with [[psychopathology]] and approached with a certain pessimism regarding the chance of help or improvement. Sexual problems were merely symptoms of a deeper malaise and the diagnostic approach was from the psychopathological. There was little distinction between difficulties in function and variations nor between perversion and problems. Despite work by psychotherapists such as Balint sexual difficulties were crudely split into [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder|frigidity]] or [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], terms which too soon acquired negative connotations in popular culture.

The achievement of ''Human Sexual Inadequacy'' was to move thinking from psychopathology to ''learning'', only if a problem did not respond to educative treatment would psychopathological problems be considered. Also treatment was directed at couples, whereas before partners would be seen individually. Masters and Johnson saw that sex was a joint act. They believed that sexual communication was the key issue to sexual problems not the specifics of an individual problem. They also proposed co-therapy, a matching pair of therapists to the clients, arguing that a lone male therapist could not fully comprehend female difficulties.

The basic Masters and Johnson treatment program was an intensive two-week program to develop efficient sexual communication. Couple-based and therapist led the program began with discussion and then sensate focus between the couple to develop shared experiences. From the experiences specific difficulties could be determined and approached with a specific therapy. In a limited number of male only cases (41) Masters and Johnson had developed the use of a female surrogate, an approach they soon abandoned over the ethical, legal and other problems it raised.

In defining the range of sexual problems Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced by the majority of people, dysfunctions bounded male primary or secondary [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[premature ejaculation]], [[ejaculatory incompetence]]; female primary [[orgasmic dysfunction]] and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse ([[dyspareunia]]) and [[vaginismus]]. According to Masters and Johnson [[sexual arousal]] and [[orgasm|climax]] are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but despite being autonomic it can be inhibited. Masters and Johnson treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.

Despite the work of Masters and Johnson the field in the US was quickly overrun by enthusiastic rather than systematic approaches, blurring the space between 'enrichment' and therapy. Although it has been argued that the impact of the work was such that it would be impossible to repeat such a clean experiment.

According to the Smarthistory about page:
{{quote|We are interested in delivering the narratives of art history using the read-write web's interactivity and capacity for authoring and remixing. Publishers are adding multimedia to their textbooks, but unfortunately they are doing so in proprietary, password-protected adjunct websites.

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sophie's World''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Sofies verden'') is a 1991 novel by Norwegian writer [[Jostein Gaarder]]. It follows the events of Sophie Amundsen, a teenage girl living in [[Norway]], and Alberto Knox, a middle-aged philosopher who introduces her to [[philosophy|philosophical]] thinking and the [[history of philosophy]].

''Sophie's World'' was originally written in Norwegian and became a best seller in Norway. It won the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] in 1994. The [[English language|English]] version of the novel was published in 1995, and the book was reported to be the best-selling book in the world in that year.
By 2011 the novel had been translated into fifty-nine languages, with over forty million [[Printing|print copies]] sold.&lt;ref&gt;''The National'': Sophie's World author turns from philosophy to climate change on Sophie's World: "The novel has now been translated into 59 languages, and has sold an estimated 40 million copies." (14 March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commercially successful Norwegian novels outside of Norway, and has been adapted into a [[Sophie's World (film)|film]] and a PC game.

==Plot summary==
Sophie Amundsen (Sofie Amundsen in the Norwegian version) is a 14-year-old [[girl]] who lives in [[Norway]] in the year 1990.

The book begins with Sophie receiving two messages in her mailbox and a [[postcard]] addressed to Hilde Møller Knag. Afterwards, she receives a packet of papers, part of a course in [[philosophy]].

Sophie, without the knowledge of her mother, becomes the student of an old philosopher, Alberto Knox. Alberto teaches her about the [[history of philosophy]]. She gets a substantive and understandable review from the [[Pre-Socratics]] to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In addition to this, Sophie and Alberto receive postcards addressed to a girl named Hilde from a man named Albert Knag. As time passes Knag begins to hide birthday messages to Hilde in ever more impossible ways, including hiding one inside an unpeeled banana and making Alberto's dog, Hermes, speak.

Eventually, through the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], Sophie and Alberto figure out that their entire world is a literary construction by Albert Knag as a present for Hilde, his daughter, on her 15th birthday. Hilde begins to read the manuscript but begins to turn against her father after he continues to meddle with Sophie's life by sending fictional characters like [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] to talk to her.

Alberto helps Sophie fight back against Knag's control by teaching her everything he knows about philosophy, through the [[Renaissance]], [[Romanticism]], and [[Existentialism]], as well as [[Darwinism]] and the ideas of [[Karl Marx]]. These take the form of long pages of text, and, later, monologues from Alberto. Alberto manages to concoct a plan so that he and Sophie can finally escape Albert's [[imagination]]. The trick is performed on [[Midsummer]]'s Eve, during a "philosophical garden party" that Sophie and her mother arranged to celebrate Sophie's fifteenth birthday. The party soon begins to follow into chaos as Albert Knag lords his control over the world, causing the guests to react with indifference to extraordinary occurrences. Alberto informs everyone that their world is fictional but the guests react with rage, believing him to be instilling dangerous values in the children. When a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] smashes into the garden, Alberto and Sophie use it as an opportunity to escape. Knag is so focused on writing about the car that he doesn't notice them escaping into the real world.

Having finished the book, Hilde decides to help Sophie and Alberto get revenge on her father. Alberto and Sophie cannot interact with anything in the real world and cannot be seen by anyone but other fictional characters. A woman from [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] gives them food before they prepare to witness Knag's return to [[Lillesand]], Hilde's home.

While at the airport, Knag receives notes from Hilde set up at shops and gateways, instructing him on items to buy. He becomes increasingly paranoid as he wonders how Hilde is pulling the trick off. When he arrives back home, Hilde has forgiven him now that he has learned what it is like to have his world interfered with. Alberto and Sophie listen as Knag tells Hilde about one last aspect of philosophy—the [[universe]] itself. He tells her about the [[Big Bang]] and how everything is made up of the same material, which exploded outward at the beginning of time. Hilde learns that when she looks at the stars she is actually seeing into the past. Sophie makes a last effort to communicate with her by hitting her and Knag with a wrench. Knag doesn't feel anything, but Hilde feels as though a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]] stung her, and can hear Sophie's whispers. Sophie wishes to ride in the [[rowboat]] but Alberto reminds her that as they are not real people, they cannot manipulate objects. In spite of this, Sophie manages to untie the rowboat and they ride out onto the lake, immortal and invisible to all but a few. Hilde, inspired and mesmerized by philosophy and reconnected with her father, goes out to get the boat back.

==Adaptations==

===Computer game===
In 1998 it was adapted into a [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Mac OS|Mac]] [[CD-ROM]] [[video game|game]] by [[The MultiMedia Corporation]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} The game allows players to learn about philosophy as in the book, while adapting the [[metafiction]] elements for a virtual world.

:''This article is about the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. For the organisation which contains the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, see [[Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology]], and for the current National Health arm see [[Tavistock Clinic]]''

The '''Tavistock Institute of Human Relations''' or '''TIHR''' is a British not-for-profit organisation which applies social science to contemporary issues and problems. It was initiated in 1946, when it developed from the [[Tavistock Clinic]], and was formally established as a separate entity in September 1947. The journal [[Human Relations (journal)|''Human Relations'']] is published on behalf of the Tavistock Institute by [[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tavinstitute.org/humanrelations/index.html|title=Human Relations|website=www.tavinstitute.org|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located in Tabernacle Street in [[Islington]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavinstitute.org/|title=The Tavistock Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tavistock Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Tavistock==
The early history of the Tavistock Institute overlaps with that of the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust#Early history|Tavistock Clinic]] because many of the staff from the Clinic worked on new, large-scale projects during [[World War II]], and it was as a result of this work that the Institute was created.

During the war, staff from the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] played key roles in British Army psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Institute can be found in the publication ''[http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/ericsess.html The Social Engagement of Social Science: A Tavistock Anthology]'' published by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Press in three volumes between 1990 and 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with colleagues in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and the [[British Army during the Second World War|British Army]], they were responsible for innovations such as [[War Office Selection Boards|War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs)]] and [[Civil Resettlement Units|Civil Resettlement Units (CRUs)]], and also worked on psychological warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ky3gSOreBOIC&amp;pg=PA31|title=The British Army and the People's War, 1939-1945|last=Crang|first=Jeremy A.|date=2000-11-18|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719047411|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BCtUCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116e|title=Ruling Minds: Psychology in the British Empire|last=Linstrum|first=Erik|date=2016-01-04|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674088665|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Square Pegs and Round Holes: Aptitude Testing in the Barracks and Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mugpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tavistock+CRUs+resettlement&amp;dq=Tavistock+CRUs+resettlement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK87mgpvzVAhUNLVAKHcOJCyUQ6AEIRjAG|title=Tools for transformation: a personal study|last=Curle|first=Adam|date=1990|publisher=Hawthorn Press|isbn=9781869890216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kgwe155uywYC|title=The Pursuit of the Nazi Mind: Hitler, Hess, and the Analysts|last=Pick|first=Daniel|date=2012-06-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191641046|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group that formed around the WOSBs and CRUs were fascinated by this work with groups and organisations, and sought to continue research in this field after the war. Various influential figures had visited the WOSBs during the war, so there was scope for consultancy work, but the Clinic staff also planned to become a part of the [[National Health Service]] when it was established, and they had been warned that such consultancy and research would not be possible under the auspices of the NHS.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g__OBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fifty Years of the Tavistock Clinic (Psychology Revivals)|last=Dicks|first=H. V.|date=2014-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317587897|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was created in 1947 to carry out organisational research when the Clinic was incorporated into the NHS.&lt;ref name="mtwp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/tavis1/tavis1.html|title=The Social Engagement of Social Science|last=Trist|first=Eric|last2=Murray|first2=Hugh|date=1990|website=www.moderntimesworkplace.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded a significant grant that facilitated the creation of the TIHR.

In the early years of the TIHR, income was derived from research grants, contract work, and fees for courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N5jZAAAAMAAJ|title=A History of Group Study and Psychodynamic Organizations|last=Fraher|first=Amy Louise|date=2004|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=9781853437045|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, the TIHR carried out a number of signature projects in collaboration with major manufacturing companies including [[Unilever]], the Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Co., [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Bayer]], and Glacier Metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XBWLfba4adMC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Tavistock+unilever&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tavistock%20unilever&amp;f=false|title=Renewing Unilever : Transformation and Tradition: Transformation and Tradition|last=Jones|first=Geoffrey|date=2005-07-01|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=9780191556388|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bifM3CY-6fgC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Centre+for+Applied+Social+Research+(CASR),+tavistock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Centre%20for%20Applied%20Social%20Research%20(CASR),%20tavistock&amp;f=false|title=Group Psychology and Political Theory|last=Alford|first=C.

Particular focusses included management, women in the workplace, and the adoption (or rejection) of new technologies. Projects on the interaction between people and technology later became known as the [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Gordon|last2=Sommerville|first2=Ian|date=2011-01-01|title=Socio-technical systems: From design methods to systems engineering|url=https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article/23/1/4/693091/Socio-technical-systems-From-design-methods-to|journal=Interacting with Computers|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=4–17|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2010.07.003|issn=0953-5438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s also saw the TIHR conducting consumer research and exploring attitudes to things as varied as [[Bovril]], [[fish finger]]s, coffee and hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tihr-archive.tavinstitute.org/social-science-action-reports-tavistock-archive/|title=Social Science in Action: reports from Tavistock Institute Archive - TIHR Archive Project|date=2016-09-01|work=TIHR Archive Project|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the TIHR had a notable focus on public health organisations such as hospitals. Studies examined a range of aspects of healthcare, from ward management and operating theatres to the organisation of cleaning staff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite archive |first= |last= |item = |item-url = http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo==%27SATIH%27%29 |type = |item-id = SA/TIH |date = |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = |box= |collection = Tavistock Institute of Human Relations Archives |collection-url = |repository = |institution = Wellcome Library |location = London |oclc= |accession= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the TIHR conducted work for the European Commission and British government bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Research units ===
In the TIHR's early years, there were four main units: Programme Groups A and B within a Committee on Human Resources; Organisation and Social Change and Operations Research Unit; and a Committee on Family and Community Psychiatry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Human Resources Centre (HRC) and the Centre for Applied Social Research (CASR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=57oo43hXpiUC&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=Centre+for+Applied+Social+Research+(CASR),+tavistock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Centre%20for%20Applied%20Social%20Research%20(CASR),%20tavistock&amp;f=false|title=Governing the Present: Administering Economic, Social and Personal Life|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|last2=Miller|first2=Peter|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=0745654924|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were established in the 1950s, and in 1963 the Institute of Operational Research (IOR) was established in conjunction with the British Operational Research Society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/IOR|title=Institute for Operational Research|website=mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Organisational and Operational Research (COOR) was created from a merger of the HRC and the IOR in 1979.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Self Help Alliance project begun in the 1980s led to further work in evaluation and the creation of a dedicated unit, the Evaluation Development Review Unit (EDRU) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2016/09/social-science-in-action-reports-from-tavistock-institute-archive/|title=Social science in action: reports from Tavistock Institute of Human Relations (TIHR) Archive|work=Wellcome Library|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key figures ===
The Institute was founded by a group of key figures from the [[Tavistock Clinic]] and British Army psychiatry including [[Elliott Jaques]], [[Henry Dicks]], Leonard Browne, Ronald Hargreaves, [[John Rawlings Rees]], [[Mary Luff]] and [[Wilfred Bion]], with [[A.T.M. Wilson|Tommy Wilson]] as chairman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other well-known people that joined the group shortly after were [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]], [[J. D. Sutherland]], [[John Bowlby]], [[Eric Trist]], and [[Fred Emery]]. Although he died before the TIHR was formally established, [[Kurt Lewin]] was an important influence on the work of the Tavistock: he was a notable influence on Trist, and contributed an article to the first issue of ''[[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OTH_CQAAQBAJ|title=Behavior, Technology, and Organizational Development: Eric Trist and the Tavistock Institute|last=Trahair|first=Richard|date=2015-06-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412855495|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/toc/huma/1/1|title=Human Relations - Volume 1, Number 1, Jun 01, 1947|website=journals.sagepub.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the members of the Tavistock Institute went on to play major roles in psychology. [[John Rawlings Rees]] became first president of the [[World Federation for Mental Health]].&lt;ref name="mtwp" /&gt; Jock Sutherland became director of the new post-war Tavistock Clinic, when it was incorporated into the newly established British [[National Health Service]] in 1946. Ronald Hargreaves became deputy director of the [[World Health Organization]]. Tommy Wilson became chairman of the Tavistock Institute.&lt;ref name="mtwp" /&gt; One of the most influential figures to emerge from the Institute was the psychoanalyst [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]]. Her seminal paper 'A case study in the functioning of social systems as a defence against anxiety' (1959) inspired a whole branch of organisational theory emphasizing unconscious forces that shape organizational life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/20/1|title=Isabel Menzies Lyth|last=Dartington|first=Tim|date=2008-02-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.K. Rice did considerable work on problems of management, increasing productivity at one factory by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ofek-groups.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=54|title=Albert Kenneth (Ken) Rice 1908-1969|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ofek-groups.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Miller became director of the ''Group Relation Program'' in 1969, and in this function he later developed the design of the [[Nazareth-Conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fed with Tears – Poisoned with Milk.

Tutu|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tavistock Institute became known as a major proponent in Britain for psychoanalysis and the psychodynamic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers. Other names associated with the Tavistock include [[Melanie Klein]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[J. A. Hadfield]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Charles Rycroft]], [[Enid_Mumford|Enid Mumford]] and [[R. D. Laing]].{{refn|Laing came to the Tavistock Institute in 1956 at the invitation of Jock Sutherland, who was then director of the Tavistock Clinic, to train on a grant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1263]&lt;/ref&gt; His training, under Charles Rycroft, was at the Institute of Psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/laing.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current activities==
The Tavistock Institute engages in educational, research, consultancy and professional development work in the [[social sciences]] and [[applied psychology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its clients are diverse, ranging from public sector organisations, including the [[European Union]], several [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British government]] departments, Third Sector and private clients. The Institute owns [[Human Relations (journal)|''Human Relations'']], the international social sciences journal. It also edits the journal ''Evaluation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/evaluation#description|title=Evaluation {{!}} SAGE Publications Ltd|website=uk.sagepub.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus of conspiracy theorists==
The Tavistock Institute is associated with conspiracy theories, the most common of which associate it with [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Two books focusing on this are ''The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations: Shaping the Moral, Spiritual, Cultural and Political'' (2006) by John Coleman and ''Tavistock Institute: Social Engineering the Masses'' (2015) by [[Daniel Estulin]].

The ''Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories'' notes that the Tavistock Institute has been named by some conspiracy theorists in their worldviews, including having a part in "The most extravagant anti-[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]] conspiracy theory" of John Coleman "known as [the] 'Aquarian Conspiracy'. This totalitarian agenda culminates in the Illuminati 'taking control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.'" By "'means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Rough Guides|date=February 4, 2013|ISBN=1409362450|title=The Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories, Third Edition|author1=James McConnachie |author2=Robin Tudge }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[HuffPo|The Huffington Post]]'' also mentioned this idea "from popular conspiracy theorist Dr John Coleman", saying that "The Tavistock Institute is a publicly known British charity founded in 1947, but conspiracy theorists believe the Institute's real purpose is to similarly engineer the world's culture." The ''Post'' looks at Coleman's claim that the popularity of the Beatles was an Illuminati plot to advance the "Aquarian Conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Beatles Fan Theories You'll Think Are So Crazy They Might Just Be True|author=Todd Van Luling|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/the-beatles-fan-theories_n_6258074.html|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''''The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations''''' is a descriptive list which was created by [[Georges Polti]] to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this Polti analyzed classical [[ancient Greece|Greek]] texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of [[Carlo Gozzi]], who also identified 36 situations.

==Publication history==
{{quote box|align=right|width=300px|quote=“Gozzi maintained that there can be but thirty-six tragic situations. Schiller took great pains to find more, but he was unable to find even so many as Gozzi.” |source= —[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polti |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Polti |title=The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:The_thirty-six_dramatic_situations_(1921).djvu |year=1921 |month= |origyear=1916 |publisher=James Knapp Reeve |location=Franklin, Ohio |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples.  The original French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted to this day.

The list is popularized as an aid for writers, but it is also used by dramatists, [[storytelling|storyteller]]s and many others. Other similar lists have since been made.

[[File:United-Nations-University-03.jpg|thumb|United Nations University in Tokyo]]

The {{nihongo|'''United Nations University'''|国際連合大学|Kokusai rengō daigaku}} ('''UNU'''), established in 1973, is the academic and research arm of the [[United Nations]]. It is headquartered in [[Shibuya, Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with diplomatic status as a UN institution. Since 2010, UNU has been authorized by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to grant degrees. It also provides a bridge between the UN and the international academic, policy-making and private sector communities.

==Organisation and leadership==

The university is headed by a rector, who holds the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]].

To date, there have been six Rectors at UNU.  
The current Rector, since March 2013, is Dr. [[David M. Malone]] of Canada.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The University was established in 1973 and formally began its activities in 1976 following the signature of the permanent headquarters agreement between the United Nations and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280102344|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the United Nations University was set in motion by Secretary-General [[U Thant]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2573XXIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2573(XXIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=24 |resolution_number=2573 |accessdate=2008-05-02|date=13 December 1969|title=International university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNU Institutes and Vice-Rectorate===
Over the years, several Institutes of UNU were created to help with the research initiatives of the United Nations. Most notably, in 2007, a vice-rectorate was established in Bonn (UNU-ViE), Germany, as a way of strengthening UNU's presence in Europe. UNU-ViE is dedicated to developing knowledge-based sustainable solutions for global problems and is, therefore, an active organizer of international science policy dialogues for sustainability.

===UNU as a degree-granting institution===

In December 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] amended the UNU Charter to make it possible for UNU to "grant and confer master's degrees and doctorates, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions under conditions laid down for that purpose in the statutes by the Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unu.edu/about/charter#ART-1|title=UNU Charter|work=unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, UNU-ISP announced its intention to seek accreditation from the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE) which is the Japanese accreditation agency for higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|title=Jobs {{!}} UNU Institute for Sustainability and Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922084737/http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNU-IAS was formally accredited in April 2015, making it the first international organization to be recognized by the NIAD-UE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unu.edu/news/news/unu-ias-accredited-by-the-national-institution-for-academic-degrees-and-university-evaluation-japan.html|title=UNU-IAS Accredited by the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2015|website=unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The university has several campuses spread over five continents. Its headquarters are located at the UNU Centre in Tokyo, Japan.

==Research ==

The role of the UN University is to generate new knowledge, educate, enhance individual and institutional capacities, and disseminate its useful information to relevant audiences. Within the scope of these five thematic clusters, the UN University undertakes:

*Cross-cultural, interdisciplinary research (utilizing innovative, science-based techniques and methodologies to study important global processes and elaborate forward-looking solutions) and targeted foresight and policy studies (aimed at developing policy-relevant prescriptions and evaluating the feasibility and comparative advantages of each option);
*Postgraduate-level education (degree-oriented programmes and specialized training focused on problems and solutions rather than academic disciplines) and capacity development activities (aimed at helping developing and transitional countries to enhance local potential to address current problems/confront emergent challenges); and
*Knowledge sharing and transfer (to deliver relevant information about UN University research, current scientific advances and best practices, in a timely manner and in a usable form, to those who most need it and can best utilize it).

As prescribed in the United Nations University Strategic Plan 2011–2014, the 26 major topics of focus of the UN University's academic work fall within five interdependent thematic clusters:
#Peace, Security and Human Rights; Peace building and peace keeping, Conflict resolution and human security, Fostering dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures, Human rights and ethics, Gender equality and mainstreaming,
#Human and Socio-economic Development and Good Governance; Growth and economic development, Alleviating poverty and inequalities, Good governance, Enhancing educational capacities, Fair trade, Processes and consequences of regional integration and cooperation, Leadership, management and entrepreneurship.
#Global Health, Population and Sustainable Livelihoods; Global health, Safe water and sanitation, Food and nutrition for human and social development, Combating HIV/AIDS, Population changes and migration.
#Global Change and Sustainable Development; Climate change — adaptation and mitigation, Ecological health and biodiversity, New risk and vulnerabilities, Sustainable land, agriculture and natural resources management, Green economy.
#Science, Technology, Innovation and Society; Science, technology and innovation, Sustainable energy futures, Sustainable urban futures, Sustainable housing and construction.

Collectively, these thematic clusters define the programme space within which the UN University undertakes its academic activities. Some key perspectives (such as gender equality, human rights and sustainability) pervade all aspects of the UN University's work.

== History ==
Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is named after former educator, politician, and school administrator, [[Vernon Malone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/wake-ed-blog/article10284485.html|title=Wake County names new high school after Vernon Malone|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone was consequential in merging Wake County Public Schools and Raleigh schools, ending [[racial segregation]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/article200805494.html|title=Leader in merger of Wake County and Raleigh schools, Roy Tilley, dies|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the name for the college and career academy, the Wake County [[board of education]] unanimously passed a resolution signifying their support for the school to be named after Malone, who had formerly served as the first Chairman for Wake County Public Schools following the merger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The inaugural principal when the school opened in 2014, was Dr. Ashlie Thompson.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article10067285.html|title=New Wake County technical high school short on students|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcpss.net/Page/266|title=Superintendent / Area Superintendents|website=www.wcpss.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since left the position and now serves as an Area Superintendent for Wake County Public Schools in the district that Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''Website localization''' is the process of adapting an existing website to local language and culture in the [[target market]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/10/08/culture-and-website-localization|title=Culture and Website Localization|last=Payne|first=Neil|date=8 October 2004|work=[[WebProNews]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uaaxzK3s|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of adapting a website into a different linguistic and cultural context&lt;ref name=SANDRINI&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandrini|first=Peter|title=Website Localization and Translation|journal=MuTra 2005 – Challenges of Multidimensional Translation: Conference Proceedings|series=EU-High-Level Scientific Conference Series|issue=131-138|url=http://www.translationconcepts.org/pdf/MuTra_2005_Proceedings.pdf#page=135|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;— involving much more than the simple translation of text. This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site – all while maintaining the integrity of the website.  Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable.&lt;ref name="Shneor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rotem|date=2014-02-28|title=Influences of culture, geography, and infrastructure on website localization|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1034102170?accountid=14667|journal=Cross Cultural Management|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|access-date=2017-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI/&gt; Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems "natural", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rodem|title=Influences of culture, geography and infrastructure on website localization decisions|journal=Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal|date=2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047475|accessdate=19 March 2014|doi=10.1108/13527601211247099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two factors are involved—programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Localization|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/website-localization|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given way to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users.&lt;ref name="Pym"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199239306.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199239306-e-028|title = Oxford Handbooks|last=Pym|first=Anthony|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets.  As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing.&lt;ref name="Shneor"/&gt; Creators take into account the "language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits" of the target culture in order to optimize results.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

==Process==
Website localization is more than mere [[translation]].&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-06/business/0108060190_1_localization-translation-web-sites|title=Translators go beyond language as Web sites cross borders|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=6 August 2001|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uabN4muG|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Localization?|url=http://www.gx-localizations.com/about.asp|publisher=GX Localizations|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=John|title=SIGDOC '99 Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation|year=1999|publisher=ACM|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58113-072-4|pages=127–129|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/320000/318569/p127-stanley.pdf?ip=141.213.236.110&amp;id=318569&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=B5D9E165A72B697C%2E0A17827594E6F2C8%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=419590667&amp;CFTOKEN=40207095&amp;__acm__=1394480330_f23b71ce60f010c26de5d84eebbfbb5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” &lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; Target locale is understood as the “[[Market segmentation|market segment]] defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” &lt;ref name=PYM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pym|first=Anthony|title=Website localization|year=2011|url=http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/on-line/translation/2009_website_localization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt; In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: [[information architecture]], theme and navigation, [[graphics]], photographs, audio, and visual.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"/&gt; Third is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.

There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;

==Backend localization==
Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located.&lt;ref name=LAKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lako|first=Cristian|title=The Elements of the Website Localizations Process|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321921734/abstract?accountid=14667|work=Studia Universitatis Petru Major. Philogia|publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Website Analytics Software:&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt; This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains.
* Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using [[metadata]]. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Information Storage: [[Databases]] are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;

==The business of website localization==
Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wandrianne|first=Dias|title=The Business Behind Translation|url=http://www.ccaps.net/blog/the-business-behind-translation/|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

'''Women in music education''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women musicians, conductors, teachers and educational administrators]] in [[music education]] at the [[elementary school]] and [[secondary education]] levels. While [[music critic]]s argued in the 1880s that "...women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;
