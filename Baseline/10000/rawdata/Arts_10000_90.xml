==Top-grossing films (U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Box Office Digest, March 1944, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, [[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]] performed at an extraordinary 254% while [[Thousands Cheer]] was a hit at 176%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.

'''Advanced Fashion Design and Technology''' is the [[manufacturing]] process related to fashion which integrates the newest technologies. 

==CAD==
It specifically refers not only to the [[design]] process, but furthermore to the [[manufacturing]], which is defined as being "advanced". It utilizes [[Computer-aided design|CAD]], to patternmake and design. The first CAD package for clothing came out in 1985, which significantly helped to decrease inefficiencies in making and readjusting panel patterns. Since 1985, computer clothing design software packages have made tremendous advancements. 

===Main functions===

1. 
*Draping
*Grading; 
*Fashion drawing; 
*Fashion trends and forecasting; 
*Trade sketching; 
*Embellishing garments; 
*Using electronic fashion design tools; 
*Interacting/networking with the fashion design industry
*Quality assurance

===Tech Design===
Another way that technology has contributed to the fashion industry is in the manufacturing process. Many garments today are produced through outsourcing in other countries. A way to do this efficiently and effectively is through [[Tech Pack]]s. Tech Packs contain 9 pages of information that help the manufacturer communicate with the designer. Here is the order of the pages:

*A summary page with a drawn example of the garment (usually using Adobe Illustrator)
*Construction details (in-depth details of different pieces to the garment)
*Dimensions (in-depth measurements of garment)
*Order of Operation (order of construction)
*Component (list of different pieces/trims involved)
*Cost Section (cost and quantity of materials)
*Label Section (illustration and description of tags/labels on garment)
*Shipping (manner in which product is packaged and shipped)
*History (any changes prior to finishing)

==Databases==
The fashion industry has been using databases to aggregate and organize information specific to the industry.  Below are some examples of such databases.

1. Mix-and-Match databases

The mix-and-match database is a database that is being used in Hong Kong.  Traditionally, fashion companies depend on sales associates to complimentary clothing recommendations for customers.  The mix-and-match database essentially does the same thing, but in a different way.  In order to use this database all clothes in the store have to be tagged with a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag.[http://www.sangsunomc.co.kr/board/sangsunomc_info_01/174?page=12 .]  In addition, each fitting room has to be equipped with a computer monitor.  When a customer brings a clothing item with a RFID tag into the fitting room, the computer monitor will identify the garment, and display photographs of complementary items using the database.&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

2. Fashion Library databases

An example of a useful database that is the National Fashion Institute of Fashion Technology's Virtual Fashion Library (VFL) in India. This database is specifically organized to meet the needs of India's fashion designers. The VFL's most useful tool is the its Fashion Image Inventory.  The inventory includes three image banks: the Indian fashion museum, the virtual swatch library, and archives of fashion shows.  The Indian fashion museum contains pictures and videos of Indian costumes and dress throughout various historical periods. The virtual swatch library includes a collection of fabrics from all over India which helps designers select fabrics and patterns made in India.  The archives fashion show contains videos of India's top fashion runway shows.&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marketing}}

'''Advertising''' is a [[marketing]] communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.&lt;ref name="Stanton"&gt;William J. Stanton. ''Fundamentals of Marketing''. McGraw-Hill (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}} Sponsors of advertising are typically businesses wishing to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser pays for and has control over the message. It differs from personal selling in that the message is non-personal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;{{rp|661,672}}
Advertising is communicated through various mass media,&lt;ref name="Bovee"&gt;Courtland L. Bovee, William F. Arens. Contemporary Advertising, Fourth Edition. Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[old media|traditional media]] such as newspapers, magazines, [[television advertisement|television]], [[radio advertisement|radio]], [[outdoor advertising]] or [[direct mail]]; and [[new media]] such as [[Online advertising#Search ads|search results]], blogs, social media, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an '''advertisement''', or "'''ad'''" or '''advert''' for short.

Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "[[brand]]ing", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as [[direct response advertising|direct-response advertising]]. [[Non-commercial]] entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of [[persuasion]], such as a [[public service announcement]]. Advertising may also help to  reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.

Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with [[tobacco advertising]] in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of [[Edward Bernays]], considered the founder of modern, "[[Madison Avenue]]" advertising.&lt;ref name="Studlar2002p55"&gt;Donley T. Studlar (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GmN9-GXTu4wC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Tobacco Control: Comparative Politics in the United States and Canada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509234835/https://books.google.com/books?id=GmN9-GXTu4wC&amp;pg=PA55 |date=May 9, 2016 }} p.55 quotation: "...&amp;nbsp;from the early days advertising has been intimately intertwined with tobacco. The man who is sometimes considered the founder of modern advertising and Madison Avenue, Edward Bernays, created many of the major cigarette campaigns of the 1920s, including having women march down the street demanding the right to smoke."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford2010p15"&gt;Donald G.

{{Main|History of advertising}}

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]

Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behal|first=Vikas|last2=Sareen|first2=Sania|year=2014|title=GUERILLA MARKETING: A LOW COST MARKETING STRATEGY|url=|journal=International Journal of Management Research and Business Strategy|volume=3|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high-quality steel rods and make fine-quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/graph/tcommain.htm|title=Commercial Advertising in China|accessdate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008012808/http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/graph/tcommain.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the Middle Ages began to grow, and the general population was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith", images associated with their trade would be used such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horseshoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in "Les Crieries de Paris", a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/carlin/www/docs.villeneuve.htm|title= Les Crieries de Paris|accessdate= July 9, 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150608094418/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/carlin/www/docs.villeneuve.htm|archivedate= June 8, 2015|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called "[[Quackery|quack]]" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.

=== 19th century ===

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]
[[Thomas J. Barratt]] of London has been called "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name="mat" /&gt;

As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.

In June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer &amp; Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer &amp; Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.

At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.&lt;!-- INSERT ADVERTISING AGENCIES' ROLES AFTER THEY OUTGREW BEING LIMITED TO BEING BROKERS for ADVERTISEMENT SPACE IN NEWSPAPERS --&gt;&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58" /&gt;

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products.  In 1919 it was 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in the US, and it averaged 2.2 percent of GDP between then and at least 2007, though it may have declined dramatically since the [[Great Recession]].

Industry could not benefit from its increased productivity without a substantial increase in consumer spending.  This contributed to the development of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s and 1920s, advertisers in the U.S. adopted the doctrine that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 34. "While agreeing that 'human nature is more difficult to control than material nature,' ad men spoke in specific terms of 'human instincts' which if properly understood could induce people 'to buy a given product if it was scientifically presented. If advertising copy appealed to the right instincts, the urge to buy would surely be excited'."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], became associated with the method and is sometimes called the founder of modern advertising and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiMaggio|first=Anthony|title=The Rise of the Tea Party: Political Discontent and Corporate Media in the Age of Obama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfzFF5TT0tUC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|page=12|isbn=978-1-58367-306-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429145930/https://books.google.com/books?id=jfzFF5TT0tUC&amp;pg=PA12|archivedate=April 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernays claimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The] general principle, that men are very largely actuated by motives which they conceal from themselves, is as true of mass as of individual psychology. It is evident that the successful propagandist must understand the true motives and not be content to accept the reasons which men give for what they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Propaganda|last=Bernays|first=Edward|publisher=|year=1928|isbn=|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, selling products by appealing to the rational minds of customers (the main method used prior to Bernays) was much less effective than selling products based on the unconscious desires that Bernays felt were the true motivators of human action. "Sex sells" [[Sex in advertising|became a controversial issue,]] with techniques for titillating and enlarging the audience posing a challenge to conventional morality.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dawn Blair, et al., "Ethics in advertising: sex sells, but should it?." ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues'' 9.1/2 (2006): 109+.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506134502/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref name="Leach367"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502152642/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617042943/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco companies became major advertisers in order to sell packaged cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Brandt2009p31"&gt;Brandt (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yybaN6j4IpEC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509171427/https://books.google.com/books?id=yybaN6j4IpEC&amp;pg=PA31 |date=May 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco companies pioneered the new advertising techniques when they hired Bernays to create positive associations with tobacco smoking.&lt;ref name="Studlar2002p55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford2010p15" /&gt;

Advertising was also used as a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging workers to exchange their traditional habits and community structure in favor of a shared "modern" lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), pp. 68–59. "Widespread within the socially oriented literature of business in the twenties and thirties is a notion of educating people into an acceptance of the products and aesthetics of a mass-produced culture.&amp;nbsp;... Beyond this, and perhaps more important to the consciousness of many, were the indigenous networks of social structure which generated mistrust or open opposition to corporate monopolization of culture."&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''The Men and Women We Want'' (2010), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 66] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132341/http://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66 |date=April 15, 2015 }}–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad by [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]] of the J. Walter Thompson Agency]]

At the turn of the 20th century, advertising was one of the few career choices for women. Since women were responsible for most household purchasing done, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. In fact, the first American advertising to use a [[Sex in advertising|sexual sell]] was created by a woman – for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement featured a couple with the message "A skin you love to touch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm Advertising Slogans] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530044539/http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm |date=May 30, 2012 }}, [[Woodbury Soap Company]], "A skin you love to touch", [[J. Walter Thompson]] Co., 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118–121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer.

==== On the radio from the 1920s ====

[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company, Adohr milk, and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers, followed by [[non-profit organization]]s such as schools, clubs and civic groups who also set up their own stations.&lt;ref name="uouynv"&gt;[[Robert W. McChesney|McChesney, Robert]], ''Educators and the Battle for Control of U.S. Broadcasting, 1928–35'', Rich Media, Poor Democracy, {{ISBN|0-252-02448-6}} (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Retailer and consumer goods manufacturers quickly recognised radio's potential to reach consumers in their home and soon adopted advertising techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and early [[television]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, F., ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998  pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mass media communications allowed manufacturers of branded goods to bypass retailers by advertising directly to consumers. This was a major paradigm shift which forced manufacturers to focus on the brand and stimulated the need for superior insights into consumer purchasing, consumption and usage behaviour; their needs, wants and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest radio drama series were sponsored by soap manufacturers and the genre became known as a ''[[soap opera]].''&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, radio station owners realized they could increase advertising revenue by selling 'air-time' in small time allocations which could be sold to multiple businesses. By the 1930s, these ''advertising spots,'' as the packets of time became known, were being sold by the station's geographical sales representatives, ushering in an era of national radio advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, F., ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s, manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers were developing personal relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use motivational research and [[marketing research|consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for  Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn research methods from psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing," in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commercial television in the 1950s ====

In the early 1950s, the [[DuMont Television Network]] began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as [[The United States Steel Hour]]. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show – up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Cable television from the 1980s ====

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-11-01|title=A brief history of the future of advertising: Visions and lessons from integrated marketing communications|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296396000628|journal=Journal of Business Research|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(96)00062-8|issn=0148-2963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[ad server]], online advertising grew, contributing to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=James A.|title=Electronic Commerce Beyond the "dot com" Boom|journal=National Tax Journal|date=2000|volume=53|issue=3, Part 1|pages=373–383|doi=10.17310/ntj.2000.3.04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, some websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], changed [[online advertising]] by personalizing ads based on web browsing behavior. This has led to other similar efforts and an increase in [[interactive advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Hanjun|last2=Cho|first2=Chang-Hoan|last3=Roberts|first3=Marilyn S.|title=Internet Uses and Gratifications: A Structural Equation Model of Interactive Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1 June 2005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=57–59|doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639191|issn=0091-3367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media since 1925. In 1925, the main advertising media in America were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media; by 2017, the balance between broadcast and online advertising had shifted, with online spending exceeding broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Erika|date=February 1, 2018|title=Super Bowl Ads Can't Save TV|url=&lt;!--print edition; url not determined--&gt;|journal=Fortune|type=mailed print edition|pages=pg. 12|issn=0015-8259|quote=Last year, for the first time, global ad spending on digital platforms exceeded the dolloars spent on TV - by a solid $31 billion margin.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guerrilla marketing]] involves unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message. This type of advertising is unpredictable, which causes consumers to buy the product or idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bigat|first1=Ekrem Cetin|title=Guerrilla Advertisement and Marketing|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=1 January 2012|volume=51|pages=1022–1029|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects an increasing trend of interactive and "embedded" ads, such as via [[product placement]], having consumers vote through text messages, and various campaigns utilizing [[social network service]]s such as [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culotta|first1=Aron|last2=Cutler|first2=Jennifer|title=Mining Brand Perceptions from Twitter Social Networks|journal=Marketing Science|date=22 February 2016|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–362|doi=10.1287/mksc.2015.0968|issn=0732-2399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Domain name registrants (usually those who register and renew domains as an investment) sometimes [[domain parking|"park" their domains]] and allow advertising companies to place ads on their sites in return for per-click payments. These ads are typically driven by pay per click search engines like Google or Yahoo, but ads can sometimes be placed directly on targeted domain names through a domain lease or by making contact with the registrant of a domain name that describes a product. Domain name registrants are generally easy to identify through [[WHOIS]] records that are publicly available at registrar websites.&lt;ref name=icannwhois&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whois.icann.org/ |title=ICANN Whois Database |publisher=ICANN.org |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220121557/http://whois.icann.org/ |archivedate=December 20, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising may be categorized in a variety of ways, including by style, target audience, geographic scope, medium, or purpose.&lt;ref name="Bovee" /&gt;{{rp|9–15}} For example, in print advertising, classification by style can include display advertising (ads with design elements sold by size) vs. classified advertising (ads without design elements sold by the word or line). Advertising may be local, national or global. An ad campaign may be directed toward consumers or to businesses. The purpose of an ad may be to raise awareness (brand advertising), or to elicit an immediate sale (direct response advertising). The term '''above the line''' is used for advertising involving mass media; other types of advertising and promotion are referred to as '''below the line'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-belowtheline-advertising-10099.html|title=Examples of Below-the-Line Advertising|last=|first=|date=|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional media ===
Virtually any medium can be used for advertising. Commercial advertising media can include [[Mural|wall paintings]], [[billboards]], [[street furniture]] components, printed flyers and [[rack card]]s, radio, cinema and television adverts, [[web banner]]s, mobile telephone screens, shopping carts, web [[Pop-up ad|popups]], [[skywriting]], bus stop benches, [[human billboard]]s and [[forehead advertising]], magazines, newspapers, town criers, sides of buses, banners attached to or sides of airplanes ("[[logojet]]s"), [[In-flight advertising|in-flight advertisements]] on [[Tray-table|seatback tray tables]] or overhead storage bins, taxicab doors, roof mounts and [[cabvision|passenger screens]], musical stage shows, subway platforms and trains, elastic bands on disposable diapers, doors of bathroom stalls, stickers on apples in supermarkets, [[Shopping cart|shopping cart handles]] (grabertising), the opening section of [[Streaming media|streaming]] audio and video, posters, and the backs of event tickets and supermarket receipts. Any situation in which an "identified" sponsor pays to deliver their message through a medium is advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Acting - Science of the Business|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/02/commercial-acting/|date=February 17, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=February 18, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218125757/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/02/commercial-acting/|archivedate=February 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Television advertisement|Television]]: Television advertising is one of the most expensive types of advertising; networks charge large amounts for commercial [[Broadcasting|airtime]] during popular events. The annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football]] game in the United States is known as the most prominent advertising event on television – with an audience of over 108 million and studies showing that 50% of those only tuned in to see the advertisements.&lt;ref name="A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Yes, A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million|publisher = Forbes|date = 2014-01-29|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171002055356/https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/|archivedate = October 2, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014 edition of this game, the average thirty-second ad cost US$4 million, and $8 million was charged for a 60-second spot.&lt;ref name="A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-01-29 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002055356/https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ |archivedate=October 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual advertising|Virtual advertisements]] may be inserted into regular programming through computer graphics.

The word "infomercial" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "information" and "commercial". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the target sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or website. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from customers and [[advertising professional|industry professionals]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Radio: [[Radio]] advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a station or network in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online. According to [[Arbitron]], radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Online: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[pay per click]] text ads, [[rich media]] ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A newer form of online advertising is [[Native advertising|Native Ads]]; they go in a website's news feed and are supposed to improve user experience by being less intrusive. However, some people argue this practice is deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is Native Advertising?|author=|date=|work=Digital Marketer|accessdate=September 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104032/http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|archivedate=September 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Domain names: Domain name advertising is most commonly done through pay per click [[web search engine]]s, however, advertisers often lease space directly on domain names that generically describe their products. When an Internet user visits a website by typing a domain name directly into their web browser, this is known as "direct navigation", or "type in" web traffic. Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as "geraniums" and add ".com" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with ".org" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as ".co.uk" for the United Kingdom or ".ca" for Canada). When Internet users type in a generic keyword and add .com or another [[top-level domain]] (TLD) ending, it produces a targeted sales lead.&lt;ref name=targetedtraffic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;ots=4B2XJDofFT&amp;dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;pg=PT61#v=onepage&amp;q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;f=false |title=Get Rich Click!: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money on the Internet |publisher=Free Press, Simon and Schuster |last=Ostrofsky |first=Marc |date=2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132523/https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;ots=4B2XJDofFT&amp;dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;pg=PT61#v=onepage&amp;q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;f=false |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain name advertising was originally developed by Oingo (later known as Applied Semantics), one of [[Google]]'s early acquisitions.&lt;ref name=oingo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |title=Ten Years Later – Lessons from the Applied Semantics Google Acquisition |publisher=Allthingsd.com |last=Elbaz |first=Eytan |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214035929/http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Product placements: '''{{vanchor|Covert advertising}}''' is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them "classics", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In "[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.&lt;ref name="Bovee" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

;Outdoor: [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]s and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures ([[tents]]) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted [[billboard]]s or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]]

;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (a.k.a. POP – point of purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Novelties: Advertising printed on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, pens, bags, and such is known as [[Novelty item|novelty advertising]]. Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. {{citation needed| date= January 2017}}

;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer [[Michael Phelps]]' contract with [[Kellogg's]] was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have advertised for multiple products including Pepsi, Candies from Kohl's, Twister, NASCAR, and Toyota.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;[[Aerial advertising|Aerial]]: Using aircraft, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] or [[airship]]s to create or display advertising media. [[Skywriting]] is a notable example.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== New media and advertising approaches ===

Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward the usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) such as [[TiVo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/how-americans-get-news/|title=How Americans get their news|author=|date=March 17, 2014|work=American Press Institute|accessdate=December 14, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113113347/http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/how-americans-get-news/|archivedate=November 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online advertising began with unsolicited bulk e-mail advertising known as "[[e-mail spam]]". Spam has been a problem for e-mail users since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adpushup.com/blog/the-history-of-online-advertising/|title=The History of Online Advertising|access-date=April 28, 2016|first=Ankit|last=Oberoi|website=AdPush|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425171749/http://www.adpushup.com/blog/the-history-of-online-advertising/|archivedate=April 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new online communication channels became available, advertising followed. The first banner ad appeared on the World Wide Web in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/09/first-banner-ad|website=Mashable|title=This is the World's First Banner Ad|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|access-date=April 28, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421022220/http://mashable.com/2013/08/09/first-banner-ad/|archivedate=April 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In online display advertising, display ads generate awareness quickly. Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it's used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear 'call to action'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As the mobile phone became a new mass medium in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Science with Levity|last=Bennet|first=Mike|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978 1784622954|location=|pages=301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[mobile advertising]] followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2 billion and providers such as [[Admob]] delivered billions of mobile ads.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

More advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] picture and video messages, advergames and various [[engagement marketing]] campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the [[2D barcode]], which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate logos on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can include personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, "[[Xerox]]" = "[[photocopier]]", "[[Kleenex]]" = [[Facial tissue|tissue]], "[[Vaseline]]" = [[petroleum jelly]], "[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]]" = [[vacuum cleaner]], and "[[Band-Aid]]" = [[adhesive bandage]]). However, some companies{{which|date=December 2014}} oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a [[generic trademark]] – turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a trademark is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Law School|title=Overview of Trademark Law|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150952/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|archivedate=January 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}} "Under some circumstances, terms that are not originally generic can become generic over time (a process called "genericity"), and thus become unprotected."&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Disputed inline|date=January 2017}}

From time to time, [[The CW Television Network]] airs short programming breaks called "Content Wraps", to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered "content wraps" and some products featured were [[Herbal Essences]], [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]], [[Guitar Hero II]], [[CoverGirl]], and recently [[Toyota]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A new promotion concept has appeared, "ARvertising", advertising on [[augmented reality]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pepsi's bus stop ad in London might be the best use of augmented reality yet|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5545842/pepsi-bus-stop-ad-augmented-reality|work=Blippar|publisher=The Verge, Jacob Kastrenakes|accessdate=March 25, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325205500/http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5545842/pepsi-bus-stop-ad-augmented-reality|archivedate=March 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy exists on the effectiveness of [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]] (see [[mind control]]), and the pervasiveness of mass messages ([[propaganda]]).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

With the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Pop-up, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], banner, pop-under, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009, mobile and Internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively, while older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Between 2008 and 2014, U.S. newspapers lost more than half their print advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jason|title=Will John Henry Save the Globe?|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/|publisher=Boston Magazine|date=March 2014|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niche marketing ===

Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the [[long tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&amp;siteid=62&amp;subnav=3 "Interactive – VOD"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200208/http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&amp;siteid=62&amp;subnav=3 |date=March 26, 2009 }} "Comcast Spotlight website". Retrieved October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Niche marketing could also be helped by bringing the issue of colour into advertisements. Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos.   
[[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.

=== Crowdsourcing ===
{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}

The concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the "Crash the Super Bowl" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt; Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |publisher=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |publisher=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.

This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, [[Zooppa]] has launched ad competitions for brands such as Google, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]], [[General Mills]], [[Microsoft]], [[NBC Universal]], Zinio, and [[Mini Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34241909|title=Zooppa.com, Inc.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019210743/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34241909|archivedate=October 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourced remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp |title=Are Consumer-Generated Ads Here to Stay? |publisher=iMediaConnection |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Moskowitz| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426103023/http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp| archivedate= April 26, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global advertising ===
{{Main|Global marketing}}

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.&lt;ref&gt;Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign public messaging ===
{{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising}}

Foreign governments,{{which|date=December 2014}} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.

=== Diversification ===

In the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that "big global clients don't need big global agencies any more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New technology ===

The ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.

To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG]]s, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[TV apps]]. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archivedate=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising education ===

In recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents' Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93–103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Purposes ==
Advertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = How to start and succeed in a business of your own |first=John| last=Taylor| year = 1978| page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales promotions and brand loyalty ===
Sales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are, and to jump start sales. Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.&lt;ref&gt;Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In.

While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth,&lt;ref name="Leach367" /&gt; it is not without social costs. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial e-mail]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&amp;tid=111 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=Interviews.slashdot.org |date=March 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813200327/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F03%2F1528247&amp;tid=111 |archivedate=August 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increasing difficulty in limiting exposure to specific audiences can result in negative backlash for advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Influence of gender stereotypes on advertising offensiveness and attitude toward advertising in general|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with these criticisms, the advertising industry has seen low approval rates in surveys and negative cultural portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Dromi|first2=Shai M.|title=Advertising morality: maintaining moral worth in a stigmatized profession|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=2|pages=175–206|doi=10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7|url=https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7?author_access_token=7NqWYsAc_xBowppAv-q8mve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6AEWVv2PLqubmhfuYTCeD-V3SRQ6CfZmxJResEGYJBsoZEDraaO2K-ltnWj2TVPmZ7jDY7bNZ5z2Kbuu8SoXhAHCzJkdSEdHAdS5s0BzfR6w%3D%3D|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar, fat, and salt specifically to children. Critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices. Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gussow|first1=Joan|title=Counternutritional Messages of TV Ads Aimed at Children|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education|date=March 2, 1972|pages=48–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Lady to Food Companies: Make Healthier Ads for Kids Now|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-lady-to-food-companies-make-healthier-ads-for-kids-now/|website=CBS News|accessdate=April 20, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111344/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-lady-to-food-companies-make-healthier-ads-for-kids-now/|archivedate=April 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other criticisms include the change that are brought by those advertisements on the society and also the deceiving ads that are aired and published by the corporations.

== Regulation ==

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples include restrictions for advertising [[alcohol advertising|alcohol]], [[tobacco advertising|tobacco]] or [[gambling]] imposed in many countries, as well as the bans around [[advertising to children]], which exist in parts of Europe. Advertising regulation focuses heavily on the [[false advertising|veracity]] of the claims and as such, there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products.&lt;ref name="UK_advertising"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/overview |title=Marketing and Advertising: The Law |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |date=2016-01-15 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |author=UK_advertising |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924105931/https://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/overview |archivedate=September 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising industries within some countries rely less on laws and more on systems of self-regulation.&lt;ref name="UK_advertising" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa.co.nz/ |title=Advertising Standards Authority |publisher=Advertising Standards Authority |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831014312/http://www.asa.co.nz/ |archivedate=August 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asasa&gt;{{Citation|title=Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa: About Us|url=http://www.asasa.org.za/Default.aspx?mnu_id=10/|accessdate=2010-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202014/http://www.asasa.org.za/Default.aspx?mnu_id=10%2F|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/About-ASA/About-regulation |title=About Regulation Our Framework |publisher=ASA.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007111318/https://www.asa.org.uk/About-ASA/About-regulation |archivedate=October 7, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, most forms of [[outdoor advertising]] such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently, the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/advertisments/is-consent-from-the-local-planning-authority-always-required-to-display-advertisements/ |title=What happens if an advertisement is displayed without the necessary consent? |publisher=PlanningGuidance.PlanningPortal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006191802/http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/advertisments/is-consent-from-the-local-planning-authority-always-required-to-display-advertisements/ |archivedate=October 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanblight.org/ |title=Welcome to SCRUB |publisher=Urbanblight.org |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422040852/http://www.urbanblight.org/| archivedate= April 22, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm |title=How the Highway Beautification Act Became a Law |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090604005907/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm| archivedate= June 4, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities such as [[São Paulo]] have introduced an outright ban&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/americas/12iht-brazil.html?_r=0 |title=Billboard ban in São Paulo angers advertisers – Americas – International Herald Tribune |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226112132/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/americas/12iht-brazil.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.

Some governments restrict the languages that can be used in advertisements, but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them. In France for instance, advertisers sometimes print English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with Article 120 of the 1994 [[Toubon Law]] limiting the use of English.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia and Ritchie 2006:542&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising of pricing information is another topic of concern for governments. In the United States for instance, it is common for businesses to only mention the existence and amount of applicable taxes at a later stage of a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dor.wa.gov/content/getaformorpublication/publicationbysubject/taxtopics/TaxIncluded.aspx |title=Advertising – Tax Included in Price |publisher=Department of Revenue, Washington State |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827174442/http://dor.wa.gov/Content/GetAFormOrPublication/PublicationBySubject/TaxTopics/TaxIncluded.aspx |archivedate=August 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and New Zealand, taxes can be listed as separate items, as long as they are quoted up-front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tico.ca/industry-info/advertising-requirements.html |title=Advertising Requirements |publisher=Travel Industry Council of Ontario |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918231329/http://www.tico.ca/industry-info/advertising-requirements.html |archivedate=September 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/shopping-and-buying/pricing/ |title=Pricing |publisher=Consumer Protection |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913213536/https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/shopping-and-buying/pricing/ |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most other countries, the advertised price must include all applicable taxes, enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices |title=Displaying Prices |publisher=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |author=ACCC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913152407/http://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/Display-Code.aspx?CodeId=%7B1BB5E9A2-C840-46CB-8211-88E7E34E61B7%7D&amp;ItemId=%7B37D44B06-C5E4-430C-A161-035555C10543%7D |title=Relevant Code Rule |publisher=Advertising Standards Authority |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105203616/https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/Display-Code.aspx?CodeId=%7B1BB5E9A2-C840-46CB-8211-88E7E34E61B7%7D&amp;ItemId=%7B37D44B06-C5E4-430C-A161-035555C10543%7D |archivedate=November 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/pricing/price_display_of_goods_and_services.html |title=Display of Prices for Goods and Services |publisher=Citizens Information |date=2016-05-31 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828161455/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/pricing/price_display_of_goods_and_services.html |archivedate=August 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing mix ===
{{Main|Marketing mix}}

The [[marketing mix]] was proposed by professor [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of four basic elements called the "'''four Ps'''". '''Product''' is the first P representing the actual product. '''Price''' represents the process of determining the value of a product. '''Place''' represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. The last P stands for '''Promotion''' which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to buy the product.

In the 1990s, the concept of '''four Cs''' was introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of four P's.&lt;ref name="Business for Higher Awards"&gt;{{cite book |title= Business for Higher Awards |last= Needham |first= Dave |year= 1996 |publisher=Heinemann |location=Oxford, England }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two theories based on four Cs: Lauterborn's four Cs (''consumer'', ''cost'', ''communication'', ''convenience'')

=== Advertising research ===
{{Main|Advertising research}}

Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising. It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.

Pre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archivedate=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.

Continuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.&lt;ref&gt;Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds. ''Advances in Advertising Research (Vol. VI): The Digital, the Classic, the Subtle, and the Alternative'' (Springer, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics ===
{{Main|Advertising research}}

Meanings between consumers and marketers depict [[signage|signs]] and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mick|first=Devid Glen|title=Consumer Research and Semiotics: Exploring the Morphology of Signs, Symbols, and Significance|journal=The Journal of Consumer Research|date=September 1986|volume=13|issue=2|page=196|doi=10.1086/209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Semiotics]] is the study of signs and how they are interpreted. Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels – known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH &amp; KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 3-11-017341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "key to advertising analysis" is the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Pinson|first= Christian|title= Marketing Semiotics|year= 1998|url= http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110816121627/http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf|archivedate= August 16, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product has a signifier and a signified. The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Umiker-Sebeok|first= Donna Jean|title= Marketing and Semiotics|year= 1987|publisher= Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|location= Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] commercials{{when|date=April 2015}} used a black [[silhouette]] of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Salsburey|first= Justin|title= Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url= http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105135/https://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|archivedate= May 21, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semiotics of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Koc|first= Erdogan|title= Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal= Journal of Marketing Communications|year= 2002|volume= 8|issue= 4|page= 257|doi= 10.1080/13527260210145993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature. For instance, a camera may have auto-focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service. They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical reality. For instance the [[brochure]] has a beautiful design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Holbrook|first= Morris|title= Beyond Attitude Structure: Toward the Informational Determinants of Attitude|journal= Journal of Marketing Research|date= November 1978|volume= 15|issue= 4|doi= 10.2307/3150624|page= 545|jstor= 3150624}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Male]]s tend to respond better to objective marketing-communications claims while [[female]]s tend to respond better to subjective [[marketing communications]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Silverman|first= Julian|author2= King, Catherine|title= Pseudoperceptual differentiation|journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year= 1970|volume= 34|issue= 1|pages= 119–23|doi= 10.1037/h0028807|pmid= 5436459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voiceover]]s are commonly used in advertising. Most voiceovers are done by men, with figures of up to 94% having been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Female Celebrities Still Can't Break Through the Glass Ceiling of Voice-over Work|url= http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/female-celebrity-voiceovers-glass-ceiling.html|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151009060321/http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/female-celebrity-voiceovers-glass-ceiling.html|archivedate= October 9, 2015|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been more female voiceovers in recent years,{{when|date=April 2015}} but mainly for food, household products, and feminine-care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1207/s15506878jobem4403_10|title= Gender-Differentiated Production Features in Toy Commercials|journal= Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 503|year= 2010|last1= Chandler|first1= Daniel|last2= Griffiths|first2= Merris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender effects in the processing of advertising ==

According to a 1977 study by David Statt, females process information comprehensively, while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures, methods or strategies for solving [[problem]]s, which could have an effect on how they interpret advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Statt|first= David|title= Understanding the Consumer – A Psychological Approach|year= 1977|publisher= Macmillan Press|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} According to this study, men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message, whereas females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation. Later research by a Danish team&lt;ref&gt;Vestergaard and Schrøder, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[transformation (disambiguation)|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article "The Objectification of Women in Advertising"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.&lt;ref&gt;Splendora, "Discourse", Review of Vestergaard and Schrøder, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} There are some companies, however, like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]] that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} These commercials give more natural beauty standards.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

More recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.&lt;ref&gt;

(2003), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf "The Influence of Gender on Mood Effects in Advertising"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025120035/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf |date=October 25, 2012 }}, ''Psychology and Marketing'',20 (3), 249–73.
&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Wojcicki, author of the article "Ads that Empower Women don’t just Break Stereotypes—They’re also Effective"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ads-empower-women-don-t-just-break-stereotypes-they-re-also-effective-170953/|title=Ads That Empower Women Don’t Just Break Stereotypes—They’re Also Effective|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326152331/http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ads-empower-women-don-t-just-break-stereotypes-they-re-also-effective-170953/|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how advertising to women has changed since the first [[Barbie]] commercial where a little girl tells the doll that, she wants to be just like her. Little girls grow up watching advertisements of scantily clad women advertising things from trucks to burgers, and Wojcicki states that this shows girls that they are either arm candy or eye candy.

'''''Art and Documentation''''' ({{lang-pl|Sztuka i Dokumentacja}}) is a scholarly journal on art published in the years 2009-2017 by the Art and Documentation Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.art.pl/ Art and Documentation Association]&lt;/ref&gt; in Lodz (Poland). Since 2018 the journal is published by Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk. It appears twice a year. Scholarly articles are peer-reviewed. All content is published under the Creative Commons licenses. The journal is a platform aiming at shaping views, posing questions and initiating research. It gathers scholars, artists, art critics and curators. ''Art and Documentation'' focuses on works of an ephemeral nature, i.e. conceptual or post-conceptual works and related issues and documentation and documenting of [[contemporary art]] as well as creating art based on documentation. It also publishes [[primary source]]s - gallery timelines, manifestos, artists' statements etc. The journal's aim is to include research on art within the broader field of performance studies, strengthen the relationship between academic research on art and contemporary art practices, and combine theory and practice in a more direct way. This is reflected in the topics presented in the journal and the extended scope of research and methodologies that are becoming more diverse and interdisciplinary.

[[Image:Banner making 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Nottingham]] based arts activist collective [[The Mischief Makers]] make banners using reclaimed sticky back plastics]]

'''Banner-making''' is the ancient art or craft of [[sewing]] [[banner]]s. Techniques used include [[applique]], [[embroidery]], fabric painting, [[patchwork]] and others.

==Trade union banners==
[[Image:TU banners.JPG|thumb|Banners of [[Association of University Teachers|AUT]], [[National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education|NATFHE]], Cambridge [[Labour council|TUC]] and [[Cambridge University Students' Union]]]]
In the United Kingdom, the first of these banners were sometimes painted by local signwriters, coachpainters or decorators. More often than not, they were made by a member of the local branch who was considered to be artistic. However, from 1837 onwards, more than three quarters were made by the firm of George Tutill of [[Chesham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/banners_01.shtml|title=History - British History in depth: Banners of the British Labour Movement|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; All their banners were made from pure [[silk]] woven by [[Huguenots]] in [[London]]. At the height of banner production there were said to be 17,000 [[loom]]s in operation.

The silk was stretched taut over a wooden frame and coated with India rubber, and the [[Oil paint|oil]] colours applied to it were 'old', i.e. had been standing around for a while. This allowed the [[paint]] to dry quickly and to make it more pliant or elastic.

There were many [[design]]s from the [[Bible]] (e.g. [[David]] slaying [[Goliath]]), from [[heraldry]] or from popular tradition, e.g. the "all-seeing eye", or [[symbol]]s of truth, hope or justice.

===Present===
[[File:Minster Church DSC 9374.jpg|thumb|150px|left|St Materiana depicted on the church banner at Minster, Cornwall]]

With the advent of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments in Britain after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], trades union banners lost their popularity, and many languished in damp cellars or lofts. Additionally the large number of trade union mergers (see for example [[UNISON]] and [[Amicus]]) meant that many banners no longer had the correct union name on and became obsolete. In the last 10 years or so, the interest in these banners has been rekindled, and many books, videos, postcards and the like have been produced to help people rediscover and celebrate this part of the history of working men and women.

[[Durham Miners Gala]] is probably the largest current parade of trade union banners.

There are special museums which restore, preserve and exhibit [[trade union]] banners, e.g. the [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester city centre|Manchester]] and [[Beamish Museum]] in the North East.

==Church banners==
Design is all-important in a banner for [[ecclesiastical]] use. The banner maker needs a sound knowledge of [[religious symbolism]] and [[iconography]]. There is also the question of its use, i.e. indoor or outdoor. If outdoor, it needs weatherproofing and must be able to be carried. Whether indoor or outdoor, proper storage provision must be made. The types of material can vary from vinyl to cloth.

&lt;!-- This organization's website no longer exists.  It is unknown whether the organization and its database still exists. --&gt;'''The Big Art Mob''' was a [[website]] founded in 2006 and re-launched in 2012 that provides a platform and toolset for documenting and mapping art visible in public, and was dedicated to showcasing and celebrating public art and ephemeral works such as [[street art]], [[performance art]] and [[graffiti]].  The site was conceived and created by [[Adam Gee (producer)|Adam Gee]] and [[Alfie Dennen]].

The crucial aim of the site was to create the first canonical record of all the public art in the world. The site also offered its own working definition of public art. Initially created to support the [[Channel 4]] documentary series ''[[The Big Art Project]]'', the site was spun off as a standalone site owned and administered by Art Public.  

This online documentation appears to no longer be active.  This website appears to no longer exists.

At the homepage of the Big Art Mob website were images, videos, and descriptive comments documenting [[public art]] in all its forms, and other news, as well as navigational tools for searching the site's voluminous archive (approximately 13,000 artworks mapped as of 04.09{{Clarify|date=September 2012|reason=ambiguous date format}} 2012).

The website's archive spanned back to June 2006. The archive could be searched by keyword, tag, artist name and location. The website had a twinned approach to achieving its aims: partnerships/relationships with institutions and a [[crowdsourcing]] approach.

'''''Dark Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|ダークソウル|Dāku Sōru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011 and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games in the following month. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind.

''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the [[best video games ever released]], with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The Windows version of the game was less well received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues.

In August 2012, a version of ''Dark Souls'' for [[Microsoft Windows]], ''[[#PC version|Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition]]'', was released. It featured additional content not seen in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. In October 2012, the additional content was released as [[downloadable content]] for consoles under the subtitle ''[[Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss|Artorias of the Abyss]]''. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide.  A sequel to the game, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', was released in 2014.

''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central element to ''Dark Souls'' are [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level.  When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.

Another aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the "humanity" system. There are two "forms" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form.  Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a "humanity").  In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form.  While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their "bloodstain", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.

Communication between players is deliberately restricted. Outside of character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. In addition, players can enter [[co-cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.

== Plot ==
Dark Souls has a minimalist plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design. The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. The world was once ruled by dragons. In this time period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the "First Flame" and finds the "Lord Souls". He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.

The game's protagonist is known as the chosen undead. After going through Sens Fortress, the chosen undead defeats the Iron Golem, and soon enters taken into Anor Londo. The Chosen Undead defeats Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough and then enters a throne room of Gwynevere, who gives the chosen undead an object known as the "Lordvessel". Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.

=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===
{{Main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}
At some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss. Knight Artorias was sent to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.

''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. Following the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version. International publisher [[Namco Bandai Games]] administrator Tony Shoupinou responded on their page that a PC version was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/08/dark-souls-admin-suggests-pc-could-happen-with-a-petition/ |title=Dark Souls admin suggests PC could happen with a petition |publisher=Joystiq |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, fans started a petition to bring ''Dark Souls'' to PC, with over 93,000 people signing it.&lt;ref name="pc_petition"&gt;{{cite web |title=Petition: Dark Souls for PC |url=http://petitionbureau.org/DarkSoulsForPC/ |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PC version of the game was confirmed in April 2012 via German magazine ''PC Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Donaldson |first=Alex |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |title=Dark Souls PC confirmed in PC Action magazine |website=rpgsite.net |date=April 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026202607/http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |archive-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been reported during the development process that FromSoftware had been having difficulty with the port due to inexperience with PC as a platform and were focusing on new content rather than optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-06-07-from-software-having-a-tough-time-porting-dark-souls-to-pc-frame-rate-issues-remain |title=From Software "having a tough time" porting Dark Souls to PC, frame rate issues remain |first=Fred |last=Dutton |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-branded as the ''Prepare To Die Edition'', it came out in August 2012 and featured new content, including bosses, enemies, equipment, and NPCs.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamingbolt.com/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-coming-to-pc-in-august |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition coming to PC in August « GamingBolt.com: Video Game News, Reviews, Previews and Blog |publisher=Gamingbolt.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new content, titled "''Artorias of the Abyss''", was released for consoles in October 2012 in the form of DLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/05/31/dark-souls-pc-coming-to-steam-consoles-to-get-pc-content/ |title=Dark Souls PC coming to Steam, consoles to get PC content |last=Cullen |first=Johnny |date=May 31, 2012 |publisher=VG247 |accessdate=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, it was announced that ''Dark Souls'' for PC would use [[Games for Windows – Live]] for online play and DRM, spurring fan backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |title=Gamers rallying against Dark Souls PC using Games for Windows Live |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420174732/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls'' received positive reviews from critics upon its release. One of the reviewers for ''Dark Souls'' described it as "a very hardcore dark-fantasy [role-playing game]" that is "role-playing right down to the roots", and stated that the "massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread". Another reviewer stated that "the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate."&lt;ref name="1up_gifford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Japan Review Check: Dark Souls |url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-dark-souls |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]] scored ''Dark Souls'' a 9.5/10. Much praise was given to the online system, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle to progress, whereas role-playing game enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/ |title=Dark Souls Review |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=October 3, 2011 |website=|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave ''Dark Souls'' a 9.0/10, praising the well-thought-out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere, and deep gameplay. While praising the extremely high difficulty, they stated that "there's a difference between punishing, and downright unfair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keza MacDonald |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review?page=1 |title=Dark Souls Review |publisher=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] gave ''Dark Souls'' 9/10, praising the level design and atmosphere while noting that the game's difficulty might not appeal to casual gamers.&lt;ref name="eurog_dark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-03-dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review • Page 1 • Reviews • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name="famitsu1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=16392|title=ダークソウル [PS3] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Michael Thomsen asked if a 100-hour video game was ever worthwhile, stating:

{{Quote|There is real beauty in ''Dark Souls''. It reveals that life is more suffering than pleasure, more failure than success, and that even the momentary relief of achievement is wiped away by new levels of difficulty. It is also a testament to our persistence in the face of that suffering, and it offers the comfort of a community of other players all stuck in the same hellish quagmire. Those are good qualities. That is art. And you can get all of that from the first five hours of Dark Souls. The remaining 90 or so offer nothing but an increasingly nonsensical variation on that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomsen |first=Michael |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gaming/2012/02/dark_souls_review_is_a_100_hour_video_game_ever_worthwhile_.html |title=Dark Souls review: Is a 100-hour video game ever worthwhile? – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jason Killingsworth wrote a response to Thomsen's review for ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', arguing that the game's "vertigo-inducing breadth makes it the gaming equivalent of a marathon".&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/opinion-long-live-long-rpg |title=Opinion: Long live the long RPG |author=Killingsworth, Jason |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killingsworth praised the game's length and addictive nature.&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"/&gt;

''Edge'' later retroactively awarded the game 10 out of 10 in their October 2013 20th anniversary issue, stating that over time the breadth and quality of the game's design had overruled complaints about its difficulty.&lt;ref name="edgeten"&gt;{{cite web |title=The ten amendments: we crown seven games from the last 20 years of Edge with a retrospective 10 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-ten-amendments-we-crown-seven-games-from-the-last-20-years-of-edge-with-a-retrospective-10/ |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the game, [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] praised ''Dark Souls'' in his [[Zero Punctuation]] video for its deep gameplay and immersive atmosphere, but was "disappointed" with the late-game bosses and criticized the difficulty of getting into the game, stating that the difficulty would be a key factor in turning less new players off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8802-Dark-Souls |title=Dark Souls - Zero Punctuation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-release, the game's director, [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], contemplated adding an easier [[difficulty level]], stating that he was saddened by the fact that the difficulty deterred new players from playing the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-04-dark-souls-director-considering-adding-optional-easy-mode |title=Dark Souls director considering adding optional easy mode • News • PlayStation 3 • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Namco Bandai]] claimed Miyazaki's statement was mistranslated and should have read "This fact is really sad to me and I am thinking about how to make everyone complete the game while maintaining the current difficulty and carefully send all gamers the messages behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-07-dark-souls-easy-mode-quote-a-mistranslation-apparently |title=Dark Souls Easy Mode quote a mistranslation, apparently • News • PlayStation 3 • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PC version ===
In [[GameSpy]]'s review, the port was referred to as "shabby", citing the game's limit of 30 frames per second, poor mouse and keyboard controls, and nonadjustable resolution, but the expanded content was praised, giving the game an overall favorable review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Janicki |first=Stefan |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dark-souls/1225854p1.html |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] also commented on the quality of the port, stating: "''Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition'' does not come with the technical options you would expect from a well-engineered PC game, because it's a port of a console game, and that's all FromSoftware ever promised to deliver. Anyone who passes up Dark Souls for this reason is cutting off their nose to spite their [[neckbeard (slang)|neckbeard]] of a face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stanton |first=Rich |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-28-dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-review |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review • Reviews • PC • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the producers of ''Dark Souls II'', Takeshi Miyazoe, responded to the criticism of the PC version by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected/ |title=Dark Souls’ producer says PC version was rushed, problems "were expected" |date=December 19, 2013 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is going to sound bad but our main priority was to get the game onto the PC as fast as possible, because people wanted it on the PC. The PC market in Japan is so minimal that originally there were no plans to make it on the PC, but with the strong petition from the North American and European fans, even with the lack of experience of working on a PC platform we still did our best to try to get it out as fast as possible. [The problems] were expected to a certain extent.

We did know there were PC-specific features like key-mapping and use of the mouse and keyboard, high resolution and higher frame rate, stuff like that, but... It's not that we ignored it, but it would have taken too much time for us to implement it, test it and get it up to the level people expected. It was more of a publisher (Namco Bandai) decision to say, ‘Guys, don’t worry about this – let’s just get it out and see how this works on PC.'

|[[Image:Death poem by Kuroki Hiroshi.jpg|frame|The ''jisei'', or death poem, of Kuroki Hiroshi, a Japanese sailor who died in a [[Kaiten]] suicide torpedo accident on 7 September 1944. It reads: "This brave man, so filled with love for his country that he finds it difficult to die, is calling out to his friends and about to die".]]
}}
The '''death poem''' is a genre of [[poetry]] that developed in the literary traditions of [[East Asia]]n cultures—most prominently in [[Culture of Japan|Japan]] as well as certain periods of [[Chinese history]] and [[Joseon Korea]]. They tend to offer a reflection on death—both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author—that is often coupled with a meaningful observation on life. The practice of writing a death poem has its origins in [[Zen Buddhism]]. It is a concept or worldview derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically that the material world is transient and {{nihongo|[[Impermanence|impermanent]]|無常|mujō}}, that attachment to it causes {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}}, and ultimately all reality is an {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}. These poems became associated with the literate, spiritual, and ruling segments of society, as they were customarily composed by a poet, warrior, nobleman, or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]].

The writing of a poem at the time of one's death and reflecting on the nature of death in an impermanent, transitory world is unique to East Asian culture. It has close ties with Buddhism, and particularly the mystical [[Zen Buddhism]] (of Japan), [[Chan Buddhism]] (of China) and [[Seon Buddhism]] (of Korea). From its inception, Buddhism has stressed the importance of death because awareness of death is what prompted the Buddha to perceive the ultimate futility of worldly concerns and pleasures. A death poem exemplifies both the "eternal loneliness" that is found at the heart of Zen and the search for a new viewpoint, a new way of looking at life and things generally, or a version of enlightenment (''[[satori]]'' in Japanese;'' [[Wu (Chinese religion)|wu]]'' in Chinese). According to comparative religion scholar [[Julia Ching]], [[Japanese Buddhism]] "is so closely associated with the memory of the dead and the ancestral cult that the family shrines dedicated to the ancestors, and still occupying a place of honor in homes, are popularly called the ''Butsudan'', literally 'the Buddhist altars'. It has been the custom in modern Japan to have [[Shinto wedding]]s, but to turn to Buddhism in times of bereavement and for funeral services".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Ching]], "Buddhism: A Foreign Religion in China. Chinese Perspectives", in [[Hans Küng]] and Julia Ching (editors), ''Christianity and Chinese Religions'' (New York: Doubleday, 1989), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of a death poem was limited to the society's literate class, ruling class, samurai, and monks. It was introduced to Western audiences during World War II when Japanese soldiers, emboldened by their culture's [[samurai]] legacy, would write poems before suicidal missions or battles.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Ito, ''Japanese Tokko Soldiers and Their Jisei''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese death poems==

===Style and technique===
The poem's structure can be in one of many forms, including the two traditional forms in Japanese literature: [[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]] or [[waka (poetry)|waka]].{{efn|"Kanshi" is a Chinese-style poem written in Chinese characters by a Japanese poet; while "waka", which literally means "Japanese poem", is written in lines alternating between 5 and 7 syllables}} Sometimes they are written in the three-line, seventeen-syllable [[haiku]] form, although the most common type of death poem (called a ''jisei'' 辞世) is in the waka form called the [[tanka]] (also called a ''jisei-ei'' 辞世詠) which consists of five lines totaling 31 syllables (5-7-5-7-7)—a form that constitutes over half of surviving death poems.(Ogiu, 317-318).

Poetry has long been a core part of Japanese tradition. Death poems are typically graceful, natural, and emotionally neutral, in accordance with the teachings of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]. Excepting the earliest works of this tradition, it has been considered inappropriate to mention death explicitly; rather, [[metaphor]]ical references such as sunsets, autumn or falling [[cherry blossom]] suggest the transience of life.

It was an ancient custom in Japan for literate persons to compose a ''jisei'' on their deathbed. One of earliest records was recited by [[Prince Ōtsu]], executed in 686. For examples of death poems, see the articles on the famous haiku poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]], the Japanese Buddhist monk [[Ryōkan]], [[Ōta Dōkan]] (builder of [[Edo Castle]]), the monk [[Gesshū Sōko]], and the Japanese woodblock master [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]]. The custom has continued into modern Japan. Some people left their death poems in multiple forms. Prince Ōtsu made both waka and kanshi, [[Sen no Rikyū]] made both kanshi and [[kyōka]].

On March 17, 1945, General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the Japanese commander-in chief during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], sent a final letter to Imperial Headquarters. In the message, General Kuribayashi apologized for failing to successfully defend Iwo Jima against the overwhelming forces of the United States military. At the same time, however, he expressed great pride in the heroism of his men, who, starving and thirsty, had been reduced to fighting with rifle butts and fists. He closed the message with three traditional death poems in ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form.

Unable to complete this heavy task for our country
Arrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.
But unless I smite the enemy,
My body cannot rot in the field.
Yea, I shall be born again seven times
And grasp the sword in my hand.
When ugly weeds cover this island,
My sole thought shall be [the future of] the Imperial Land.&lt;ref&gt;translations from {{cite book|last1=Kakehashi|first1=Kumiko|title=So sad to fall in battle : an account of war|date=2007|publisher=Presidio Press/Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89141-903-7|page=xxiii|edition=Presidio Press hardcover ed., 1st}}.  Though the book translates these lines as one poem, they in fact are three poems in waka form as shown in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1970, writer [[Yukio Mishima]] and his disciple [[Masakatsu Morita]] composed death poems before their attempted coup at the [[Ichigaya]] garrison in Tokyo, where they committed the ritual suicide of [[Seppuku]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Keene]], ''[[The Pleasures of Japanese Literature]]'', p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
A small night storm blows
Saying 'falling is the essence of a flower'

Although he did not compose any formal death poem on his deathbed, the last poem written by the great poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644-1694) recorded by his disciple [[Takarai Kikaku]] during his final illness is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ja|旅に病んで

{{transl|ja|''Tabi ni yande''
''yume wa kareno o''
''kakemeguru''}}

Falling ill on a journey
my dreams go wandering
over withered fields

&lt;/poem&gt;|Matsuo Bashō&lt;ref name=Kikaru&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takarai|first1=Kikaku|title=''Account of Our Master Basho's Last Days'', translated by Nobuyuki Yuasa in ''Springtime in Edo''.|journal=Simply Haiku: A Quarterly Journal of Japanese Short Form Poetry|date=Autumn 2006|volume=4|issue=3|url=http://simplyhaiku.com/SHv4n3/features/Nobuyuki.html|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, some Japanese poets have employed levity or irony in their final compositions. The Zen monk, Tokō (杜口; 1710–1795, aged 85), commented on the pretentiousness of some jisei in his own death poem:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ja|辞世とは
即ちまよひ
たゞ死なん}}

{{transl|ja|''Jisei to wa''
''sunawachi mayoi''
''tada shinan''}}

Death poems
are mere delusion —
death is death.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Yoel|title=Japanese Death Poems: Written by Zen Monks and Haiku Poets on the Verge of Death|date=1986|publisher=C.E. Tuttle Co.|location=Rutland, VT|isbn=978-0804831796}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This poem by Moriya Sen'an (d. 1838) showed an expectation of an entertaining afterlife:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ja|我死なば
酒屋の瓶の下にいけよ
もしや雫の
もりやせんなん}}

{{transl|ja|''Ware shinaba''
''sakaya no kame no''
''shita ni ikeyo''
''moshi ya shizuku no''
''mori ya sen nan''}}

Bury me when I die
beneath a wine barrel
in a tavern.
With luck
the cask will leak.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The final line, "hopefully the cask will leak" (''mori ya sen nan)'', is a play on the poet's name, Moriya Sen'an.

Written over a large calligraphic character 死 ''shi'', meaning Death, the Japanese Zen master [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (白隠 慧鶴; 1685-1768) wrote as his jisei:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{transl|ja|''Wakaishu ya''
''shinu ga iya nara''
''ima shiniyare''
''hito-tabi shineba''
''mō shinanu zo ya''}}

Oh young folk —
if you fear death,
die now!
Having died once
you won't die again.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Korean death poems==
Besides Korean Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars called [[seonbi]]s sometimes wrote death poems (절명시).  However, better-known examples are those written or recited by famous historical figures facing death when they were executed for loyalty to their former king or due to insidious plot.  They are therefore impromptu verses, often declaring their loyalty or steadfastness.  The following are some examples that are still learned by school children in Korea as models of loyalty.  These examples are written in Korean [[sijo]] (three lines of 3-4-3-4 or its variation) or in [[Hanja]] five-syllable format (5-5-5-5 for a total of 20 syllables) of ancient Chinese poetry (五言詩).

===Yi Gae===
[[Yi Gae]] (이개·1417–1456) was one of "[[six martyred ministers]]" who were executed for conspiring to assassinate [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]], who usurped the throne from his nephew [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]]. Sejo offered to pardon six ministers including Yi Gae and Seong Sam-mun if they would repent their crime and accept his legitimacy, but Yi Gae and all others refused.  He recited the following poem in his cell before execution on June 8, 1456.  In this [[sijo]], Lord (임) actually should read ''someone beloved or cherished'', meaning King Danjong in this instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sijomunhak.com/gnu4/bbs/board.php?bo_table=gosijo&amp;wr_id=143&amp;sfl=&amp;stx=&amp;sst=wr_hit&amp;sod=asc&amp;sop=and&amp;page=4 Korean Sijo Literature Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|방안에 혔는 촛불 눌과 이별하엿관대
겉으로 눈물지고 속타는 줄 모르는다.
우리도 천리에 임 이별하고 속타는 듯하여라.}}

Oh, candlelight shining the room, with whom did you part?
You shed tears without and burn within, yet no one notices.
We part with our Lord on a long journey and burn like thee.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Seong Sam-mun===
Like Yi Gae, [[Seong Sam-mun]] (성삼문·1418–1456) was one of "six martyred ministers," and was the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Sejo.  He refused the offer of pardon and denied Sejo's legitimacy.  He recited the following sijo in prison and the second one (five-syllable poem) on his way to the place of execution, where his limbs were tied to oxen and torn apart.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Cheon-tak, Cheong-gu-yeong-un, 1728&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|이 몸이 죽어 가서 무어시 될고 하니,
봉래산(蓬萊山) 제일봉(第一峯)에 낙락장송(落落長松) 되야 이셔,
백설(白雪)이 만건곤(滿乾坤)할 제 독야청청(獨也靑靑) 하리라.}}

What shall I become when this body is dead and gone?
A tall, thick pine tree on the highest peak of Bongraesan,
Evergreen alone when white snow covers the whole world.

{{lang|ko|擊鼓催人命 (격고최인명) -둥둥 북소리는 내 생명을 재촉하고,
回頭日欲斜 (회두일욕사) -머리를 돌여 보니 해는 서산으로 넘어 가려고 하는구나
黃泉無客店 (황천무객점) -황천으로 가는 길에는 주막조차 없다는데,
今夜宿誰家 (금야숙수가) -오늘밤은 뉘 집에서 잠을 자고 갈거나}}

As the sound of drum calls for my life,
I turn my head where sun is about to set.
There is no inn on the way to underworld.
At whose house shall I sleep tonight?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Jo Gwang-jo===
[[Jo Gwang-jo]] (조광조·1482–1519) was a [[neo-Confucian]] reformer who was framed by the conservative faction opposing his reforms in the [[Korean Literati Purges|Third Literati Purge of 1519]].  His political enemies slandered Jo to be disloyal by writing "Jo will become the king" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王) with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation.  [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] ordered his death by sending poison and abandoned Jo's reform measures.  Jo, who had believed to the end that Jungjong would see his errors, wrote the following before drinking poison on December 20, 1519.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], December 16, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition of similar looking words is used to emphasize strong conviction in this five-syllable poem.

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|愛君如愛父 (애군여애부) 임금 사랑하기를 아버지 사랑하듯 하였고
憂國如憂家 (우국여우가) 나라 걱정하기를 집안 근심처럼 하였다
白日臨下土 (백일임하토) 밝은 해 아래 세상을 굽어보사
昭昭照丹衷 (소소조단충) 내 단심과 충정 밝디 밝게 비춰주소서}}

Loved my sovereign as own father
Worried over country as own house
The bright sun looking down upon earth
Shines ever so brightly on my red heart.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Jeong Mong-ju===
[[Jeong Mong-ju]] (정몽주·1337–1392), considered "father" of Korean neo-Confucianism, was a high minister of [[Goryeo]] dynasty when Yi Seong-gye overthrew Goryeo and established [[Joseon]] dynasty.  He  answered with the following sijo to the future [[Taejong of Joseon]] when the latter demanded his support for the new dynasty with [[Jeong Mong-ju#Poem|a poem of his own]].  Just as he suspected, he was assassinated the same night on April 4, 1392.

'''Anatolian animal carpets''' represent a special type of pile-woven [[Turkish carpet|carpet]], woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, corresponding to the 14th–16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, and most of them are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th–16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and support our knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surviving carpets ==

=== Dragon and Phoenix carpet ===
A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between the [[fenghuang]], or Chinese [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and the dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. [[Radiocarbon dating]] confirmed that the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet was woven in the mid 15th century, during the early [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rageth|first1=Jürg|title=Dating the dragon &amp; phoenix fragments.|journal=Hali|date=2004|volume=134|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is knotted with symmetric knots.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beselin|first1=Anna|title=Geknüpfte Kunst : Teppiche des Museums für Islamische Kunst = Woven Art: Carpets of the Berlin Museum of Islamic art|date=2011|publisher=Edition Minerva|location=Wolfratshausen|isbn=9783938832806|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese motif was probably introduced into [[Islamic art]] by the Mongols, or artists working for them, during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his original borders, and seems to be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-groud octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles and rows of white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;

The Phoenix and Dragon carpet was first described in 1881 by [[Julius Lessing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Orientalische Teppiche = Oriental Carpets|date=1891|publisher=Ernst Wasmuth|location=Berlin|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Teppich-Erzeugung im Orient. Monographien von Sir George Birdwood in London, Geheimrath Dr. Wilhelm Bode in Berlin, C. Purdon Clarke in London, M. Gerspach in Paris, Sidney J. A. Churchill, M. R. A. S. in Teheran, Vincent J. Robinson in London, u.a.|date=1895|publisher=Verlag des K. K. Österreichischen Handels-Museums|location=Wien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Dragon and Phoenix carpet has been referred to in many books on Oriental carpets.

A similar fragment was discovered in [[Fustat]], with dragon and phoenix depicted in combat on a yellow field. The animals in this fragment are depicted in red, and outlined in blue. The minor border shows a variant of the "kufic" borders known from other Seljuq period carpets.

=== Marby rug ===
Another carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby in [[Jämtland]] province. The rug was radiocarbon dated to 1300–1420.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt; More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have additional rows of knots on their backsides. At a distance of every 6&amp;nbsp;cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from [[Fustat]] has similar additional knots. It has been suggested that these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of the carpet and the amount of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;46–49&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;)

=== Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum ===
The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Anatolian animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the [[Siena|Sienese]]  artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

=== Animal carpets from the Vakıflar Museum ===
The field of an animal carpet in the Vakıflar Museum, [[Istanbul]] (Inv. No. E-1)&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=HIrsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into two rectangular compartments by a band similar to its borders. An octagon containing [[confronted animals]] is inscribed into each compartment. The winged animals face a stylized tree. They show a down-turned, snout-like head, to which antler-like extensions are attached, and their body is spotted. Overall, the animals more resemble [[fallow deer]] than birds, which are usually depicted on animal carpets. Deer and fallow deer are already depicted on the borders of the [[Pazyryk carpet]], and are frequently seen on early textiles and other objects in Anatolia and Iran. Below each deer, and above the main animal, is a bird-like quadruped.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

Another animal carpet with a coarser design compared to the Vakıflar rug is at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in [[Konya]] (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;).

=== Animal carpet from the Pergamon Museum ===
Another carpet in the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a rectangular field surrounded by an eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each at the top and bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional [[Warp and woof|wefts]] can be seen meandering over two [[Warp and woof|warps]] after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;50–1&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;) See: [[knot density]].

=== Batári-Crivelli fragment, Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest ===
The animal carpet fragment is approximately half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second segment of the medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a [[mosque lamp]] ornament. In the center of the long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the "Dragon and Phoenix" and "Marby" rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. [[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, [[indigo]] blue, [[Rubia tinctorum|madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed ([[Reseda luteola]]), and Dyer's sage ([[Salvia fruticosa]]), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batári|first1=Ferenc|title=Ottoman Turkish carpets|date=1994|publisher=Budapest Museum of Applied Arts|location=Budapest|isbn=978-9630492126|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Batári, the late curator of the carpet and textile department of the museum.

Other animal carpets are at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]] and in private collections.

== Animal carpets in Renaissance painting ==
{{see also|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
Animal-style carpets begin to appear in Italian paintings in the 14th, and continue to be depicted in Western European paintings throughout the 15th century. They represent the earliest Oriental carpets which were identified in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance painting]]. The comparison of animal-style carpets on Renaissance paintings, for which the painter and the date of origin are often known, allows for the determination of a [[Terminus post quem|"''terminus ante quem''"]] date for existing carpets of similar design. Wilhelm von Bode identified a carpet on [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s 1440 painting ''The Marriage of the Foundlings'' with marked similarities to the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet. This marks the beginning of the "ante quem" method, which was subsequently further elaborated by the "Berlin School" of History of Islamic Art. By this method, a variety of existing carpets could be dated by comparison to their painted counterparts.

The illustrated rugs are generally drawn by the early Renaissance painters in a simplified manner, compared to the original carpet designs. The artists may sometimes have painted the animals out of their imagination, but the general appearance of the painted rugs still resembles the originals.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;

A general compositional analysis of the animal-style rugs from Renaissance paintings was first developed by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Orientalische Tierteppiche auf Bildern des XIV. und XV Jahrhunderts = Oriental animal carpets on paintings of the 14th and 15th century.|journal=Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen|date=1929|issue=5|pages=261–298|jstor=23350357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of animal carpets is usually divided into rectangular compartments, large or small. Each compartment contains an octagon, which in turn contains animal figures of four types:
# "Heraldic" animals, including single- or double-headed eagles;
# A pair of birds and a tree;
# Single birds or quadrupeds in a geometric frame;
# Paired animals within a frame, sometimes depicted in combat.

=== 14th century ===
At the beginning of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Siena and Florence school]]. During the second half of the 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in [[Lippo Memmi]]'s ''Virgin Mary and Child'', 1340–50, and in [[Sano di Pietro]]'s ''Marriage of the Virgin'', 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar rug in the Vakıflar Halı Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=John|title=Early animal carpets in Western paintings|journal=Hali|date=1978|volume=1|issue=3|pages=234–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A carpet fragment with a single bird with its head turned is now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragment of an animal carpet|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/448133?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=carpet+fragment&amp;pos=18|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painted counterpart can be seen in [[Niccolò di Buonaccorso]]'s "Marriage of the Virgin", 1380.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 15th – 16th century ===
By the beginning of the 15th century, the variations of the animal design increase:

Two animal-style carpet fragments from Fustat were dated to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt; They contain parts of a different version of the tree-and-birds pattern seen in the Marby rug. The field is no longer divided into fields, and the tree-and-paired birds pattern appear in offset rows, covering the field in endless repeat (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;29, plates 18,19&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

A fresco in the [[Palais des Papes]] at Avignon, by [[Matteo di Giovanni]] depicts a carpet with rather indistinct bird figures in front of the Pope's throne. Written sources of the 14th century indicate that [[Pope Benedict XII]] very much liked a carpet with "white swans", which he had set before his throne. A painting by [[Giovanni di Paolo]], 1440, shows an Anatolian animal style rug with birds spread before the pope's throne (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;33, ill. 5 and 6&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

Various examples are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A rug in the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]], dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;31, plate 20&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). A painting by [[Jaume Huguet]] in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs can be seen in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome, and in "Madonna enthroned" by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;34, ill. 7 and 8&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in [[Carlo Crivelli]]'s "Annunciation", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on [[Fra Angelico]]'s [[San Marco Altarpiece]].

The Pergamon Museum's "Phoenix and Dragon" finds its painted counterparts in Domenico di Bartolo's "The Marriage of the Foundlings" (1440) shows a very similar rug, as well as [[Alesso Baldovinetti]]'s "Tale of Saint Vincenzo Ferrerio", and [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s "Annunciation".

The Vakıflar Museum's animal carpet has a painted counterpart in [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]]'s "Portrait of Dorothy Cary, later Viscountess Rochford". The animals shown in the painted rug are very similar to the small bird-like animals in the Vakıflar carpet. As known so far, the carpet depicted in Larkin's portrait is the last of its kind, and the last animal carpet seen in a Western European painting (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62,&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt; Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

The Batári-Crivelli fragment finds its parallel in two paintings by [[Carlo Crivelli]], the ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt and the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery]] (1486). Both paintings depict a carpet with a sixteen-pointed star motif, with some compartments containing highly stylised animal motifs.

The '''Externsteine relief''' is a monumental [[rock relief]] depiction of the [[Descent from the Cross]] scene, carved into the side of the [[Externsteine]] [[sandstone]] formation in the [[Teutoburg Forest]]. The Externsteine are located near [[Detmold]], now in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] but in the Middle Ages in the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. 

It is the oldest relief of this type known north of the Alps, dated to the high medieval period (likely the 12th century).&lt;ref name="date"&gt;Otto Schmitt: "Zur Datierung des Externsteinreliefs".

==Description==
The relief measures 4.8 m high by 3.7 m wide.&lt;ref name="Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treude|first1=Elke|last2=Zelle|first2=Michael|title=Externsteine (German)|publisher=Lippischer Heimatbund|year=2012|isbn=978-3-941726-18-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

It is divided into three parts, or ''registers''. The largest, central register shows the Descent from the Cross scene itself. At the center is the cross, to the right is a figure identified as  [[Nicodemus]]. The legs of this figure have been lost since at least the 17th century, but it is shown at an elevated position, aiding in the recovery of Jesus' body from the cross. The figure was standing  supporting structure (identified either as a plant bent by Nicodemus' weight, or as a chair). Nicodemus lowers the body of Jesus towards [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who is standing to the left of the cross. To the left of Joseph is the figure of [[Mary, Mother of Jesus]] (the head of this figure has been lost), with her hand supporting the head of her son's corpse. Opposite Mary, on the right side of the scene, is [[John the Apostle]], holding a book.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The upper register shows the torso of the [[ascension of Jesus|ascended Christ]] wearing a cross [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and a victory flag. Alongside the flag, the figure is holding a small representation of a human figure with raised hands. To the left and right, anthropomorphic representations of Sun and Moon are shown, holding drapes.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The lower register shows two kneeling figures, a naked bearded man and a clothed figure of undetermined sex, both of them caught in the coils of the neck and tail of a two-legged, winged dragon. These figures were variously identified as [[Adam and Eve]] (representing the fallen state of man in general),&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}} or as a Saxon warrior and priest.

==Controversy about symbolism and dating==
The structure shown as supporting Nicodemus has gained some notability as a supposed representation of a "bent [[Irminsul]]", reflecting the theory, first suggested in the 1870s, that Externsteine was the site of the national sanctuary of the pagan [[Saxons]]. 

It could alternatively be a bent palm tree.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

[[Goethe]] writing in 1824 identified the relief as a work of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]]. In the same year Karl Theodor Menke dated it to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Theodor Menke: ''Lage, Ursprung, Namen, Beschreibung, Altherthum, Mythus und Geschichte der Extersteine''. Coppenrathsche Buch- und Kunsthandlung, Münster o.J. (1824; reprinted 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians of the later 19th and early 20th century tended to support Goethe's view of an early date of origin, but a re-examination of the evidence by a team of art historians in 1950 resulted in a shift of ''communis opinio'' towards a high medieval date.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; The view of the relief as of Carolingian date remains a minority position, especially popular by authors who would like to identify the "plant-like" structure as a representation of Irminsul, e.g. in a  1997  [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Matthes, Rolf Speckner: Das Relief an den Externsteinen. Ein karolingisches Kunstwerk und sein spiritueller Hintergrund. edition tertium, Ostfildern vor Stuttgart 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the consensus remains that the relief probably dates to 1160/70.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4872">The '''Eye and Ear Theater Company''' was founded in 1979 by [[Ada Katz]], wife of the painter [[Alex Katz]]; Roy Leaf, vice president of the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]; and theater director Mac McGinnes, as a non-profit theatrical production company. 

==Description==
Inspired by the poet and artist theaters of the 1950s and early 1960s, such as John B. Myers' Artists' Theatre and the [[Judson Poets Theatre]] of Greenwich Village, the organization sought to encourage artistic collaboration through Off Broadway productions of plays written by poets with sets and costumes designed by painters and sculptors. It was run by a Board of Directors which was composed of the company's founders along with [[Bob Holman]], Susan Davis, Beth DeWoody, [[George Schneeman]], and later Joanne Cassulon, Mark Charles, James Kraft, Rosie Levai, Michael O'Brian, and Paul Chupf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0714FB3E5D0C728CDDAC0894D0484D81&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=%22eye%20and%20ear%20theater%22&amp;st=cse Yarrow, Andrew L. "Theatrical Life on the Lower East Side" ''The New York Times'', May 1, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Board dealt with fundraising, production, administration, and publicity. It also set the company's artistic goals, and in pursuing them relied on the assistance of an Advisory Board, which included noted poets, choreographers, and artists like [[John Ashbery]], [[Edwin Denby (poet)|Edwin Denby]], [[Laura Dean (choreographer)|Laura Dean]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Jennifer Bartlett]]. The members of both bodies were volunteers who contributed resources like office space and secretarial services in addition to their time. Their work would be supported by a paid administrative staff beginning in 1985. The poets and artists were paid for their work and the sets and costumes used in the company's productions remained the property of the theatre company, which on occasion lent them to art exhibitions. Much of the organization's funding came from individuals, corporations, and foundations, as well as state and federal grants, including [[The National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Lila Acheson Wallace|Lila Acheson Wallace Fund]], the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, the Kulcher Foundation, the Leonhardt Foundation, and the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts.

==Season productions==
The Eye and Ear Theater Company strove to produce three plays per season, each developed through collaborations between poets, visual artists, and theater directors, usually with the assistance of other specialists. Among the company's productions are works from both contemporary and past poets. The organization's first production, ''City Junket'' written by [[Kenward Elmslie]] and designed by [[Red Grooms]], opened in 1980 accompanied by a smaller staging of ''Litany'' by John Ashbery with sets by Alex Katz. The next season saw the production of Edwin Denby's ''Four Plays by Edwin Denby'', a play originally written for one of [[Andy Warhol]]'s uncompleted film projects, with sets designed by [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and costumes by [[Judith Shea]] under the direction of [[Bob Holman]]. Also produced were ''The Heroes'' by John Ashbery with sets by [[Jane Freilicher]] and ''Shopping and Waiting'' by James Schuyler on a set designed by Alex Katz. In 1982 the company staged Ed Friedman's ''The White Snake'' using sets and costumes designed by [[Robert Kushner]] followed in 1983 by ''Paid on Both Sides'' by [[W.H. Auden]] designed by [[David Hockney]]. In 1984 Eye and Ear produced the single-act drama ''Desire Caught by the Tail'' by [[Pablo Picasso]] with sets developed by Linda Benglis. The next year the company produced a play it had commissioned from the poet [[Alice Notley]], ''Anne's White Glove'', on a set designed by Jane Dickson. In 1988 the company produced ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'' written by [[Allen Ginsberg]] and designed by [[Eric Fischl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9D03E0DD123BF933A25755C0A962948260 Klein, Alan.

The '''Federation of Canadian Artists''' ('''FCA''') is an association of artists in Canada founded in Toronto in 1941. The FCA soon had chapters across the country, and was one of the main forces behind formation of the [[Canada Council]] in 1957. After this, the national organization withered, and only the British Columbia chapter remained active. A drive for expansion began in 1977, causing a renewal of activity that started in western Canada and then spread. Expansion stalled out in the late 1990s when funding cuts hit the Federation as hard as it hit other arts organization. Renewed vigor by volunteers and staff in recent years has brought new life to the Federation and expansion is again underway. The organization has about 2,700 paying members and 5,000 artist contacts throughout Canada as of the end of 2017, a permanent gallery in Vancouver, and organizes approximately 44 exhibitions every year. 

==Foundation==
[[File:Leaders of the Federation of Canadian Artists on Toronto in May 1942.png|thumb|Leaders of the Federation of Canadian Artists at a meeting in Toronto in May 1942. From left to right [[Arthur Lismer]], [[Frances Loring]], [[Lawren Harris]], [[André Charles Biéler]], [[A. Y. Jackson]] ]]
[[André Charles Biéler]] organized the first conference of Canadian artists in 1941.{{sfn|André Charles Biéler, Canadian Encyclopedia}}
This conference, held in [[Kingston, Ontario]], led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=52}}
At his opening address at the Kingston conference Bieler insisted that "we should not try to unify ourselves or to attempt to make a school that would cover the whole country. 
On the contrary, I believe we must keep that regional aspect."{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=xvi}}
The Federation of Canadian Artists was founded in Toronto by a group of Canadian artists. Biéler was the first president.{{sfn|History, Federation of Canadian Artists}}

The Federation was divided into regions, each with a regional organizer. 
[[Lawren Harris]] of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] was head of the West Coast region.
The other organizers were [[Gordon Sinclair]] (Western region), [[Ernest Lindner]] (Saskatchewan), [[Byllee Lang]] (Manitoba), [[A. Y. Jackson]] (Ontario) and [[Walter Abell]] (Maritimes).{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=1}}

==Goals==

Writing in ''Maritime Art'' (February–March 1943) [[Arthur Lismer]] proposed that the goals of the Federation were to improve understanding of the role of artists in society, to encourage youth while supporting established artists and to bring art to the community.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=50}}
The FCA became a powerful national lobby for public patronage of the arts, recognized as the legitimate representative of Canadian artists.{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
J. Delisle Parker wrote in February 1945, "This is not just another art society, nor is it intended to replace any existing art society. It is an organization formed to unite all the artists in Canada, whether member of existing societies or not, in a federation which it is hoped will become a power in the country. The Federation hopes to bridge the isolation of artists in different parts of the country, discover talent and organize regional as well as country-wide activities and to publish an art magazine to serve the interests of art and artists in the country as a whole..."{{sfn|Parker|1945}}

==History==

Walter Abell's journal ''Maritime Art'' became ''[[Canadian Art (magazine)|Canadian Art]]'' in 1943 when Abell moved to Ottawa to join the staff of the Art Centre of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
The Federation sponsored ''Canadian Art'', which was the only national art magazine in the 1940s.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=4}}
''Canadian Art'' became an important vehicle for communication between artists, curators and collectors.{{sfn|Cochran|1989|p=2}}
In June 1944 the Federation and other national art organizations prepared a brief on cultural aspects of Canadian post-war reconstruction. 
This led to the formation of the Canadian Arts Council.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=3}}
The FCA was a key member of the Canadian Arts Council after it was founded in 1944.{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
At first the FCA sponsored lectures and plays in addition to exhibitions and workshops. After about 1949 it began to focus on the visual arts.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=2}}

The FCA made a major presentation to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, the Massey Commission, in Vancouver in 1949.
The presentation was instrumental in forming the [[Canada Council]], which came into being in 1957.
The FCA began to phase itself out as a national organization after this as communication across Canada became easier.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=194}}
By the 1960s there was little activity at the national level, although the regional branches persisted. In British Columbia there were 600 members.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=5}}

In 1977 Allan Edwards of the Vancouver branch, by now almost all that was left of the FCA, became president and began a drive for expansion.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=9}}
The FCA organized traveling exhibitions in British Columbia and Alberta, with some going to the east of Canada or the USA.
In the 1980s the FCA began to organize annual painting seminars on [[Saltspring Island]], which drew students from across western Canada and the USA.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=10}}

'''floorless''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] art collective based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[London]], who united in the year 2000 and are working in the boundaries between [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]] and [[Graphic design|design]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigeon Magazine no. 2, Toilet Papir Publications 2, Copenhagen 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Besides exhibiting and curating they have [[Self-publishing|self-published]] different magazines, most notably ''T6'' and ''In The Red #1'' &amp; ''#2'' which have contributions from a host of other artists, writers and musicians as well as floorless. They have exhibited in Copenhagen, [[Aarhus]], [[Odense]], [[Lemvig]], London and [[Barcelona]] since 2003, but are currently on some sort of hiatus. Most of the artwork produced by floorless has been [[Guerrilla communication|interventionist]] or radical in a non-dogmatic [[Left communism|leftist]] political sense and has had connections to [[youth subculture]] as well as the [[avant-garde]] art-scene. In graphic design, writings, [[Installation art|installation]] and curatorial initiatives their artistic expression shows a [[DIY ethic]] closer to contemporary [[street art]] than to more conventional gallery art.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Breakdown - Sound art in Copenhagen, AUX, Mediefabrikken, Copenhagen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''In The Red #3'' is expected any time between [[Present (time)|now]] and the [[future]].

[[File:Han_shot_first.gif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Han_shot_first.gif|thumb|300x300px|The [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|1997 Special Edition]] of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' depicts [[Greedo]] firing a shot at [[Han Solo]] shortly before Han responds in kind. In the original 1977 release, Han is the only one to fire. This slow-motion clip shows the 2004 version.]]
"'''Han shot first'''" refers to a controversial [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|change]] made to a scene in the [[science fiction]] film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), in which [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is confronted by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Greedo]] ([[Paul Blake (actor)|Paul Blake]]) in the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina. In the original version of the scene, Han shoots Greedo dead. Later versions are edited so that Greedo attempts to fire at Han first. Director [[George Lucas]] altered the scene to give Solo more justification for acting in self-defense. Many fans and commentators oppose the change, feeling it weakens Solo's character. The controversy is referenced in the 2018 film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.

==Scene==
Smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) has jettisoned cargo belonging to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]] to avoid capture by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] search party. As a result, Jabba offers a bounty on Solo. In the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, bounty hounter [[Greedo]] ([[Paul Blake (actor)|Paul Blake]]) corners Solo and forces him at gunpoint to sit. Solo tells Greedo he has the money to compensate Jabba, but Greedo demands the money for himself. Solo says he does not have the money with him and quietly readies his gun under the table. Greedo tells him that Jabba has run out of patience and that Greedo has been "waiting for a long time" to capture Solo. Solo replies, "Yes, I'll bet you have." The scene's conclusion varies depending on the version of the film.

==History==
In the original 1977 theatrical release of the scene, the film cuts to a closeup of Greedo's face, followed quickly by flash sparks, a cloud of smoke, and the sound effect of a blaster firing. This is followed by a reverse angle of Greedo from behind, slumping over the table. In 2012, director [[George Lucas]] expressed his dissatisfaction with this climax, believing that it depicts Solo, the film's supporting [[protagonist]], as a "cold-blooded killer".&lt;ref name="GL at HR2"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Lucas|first=George|interviewer=Alex Ben Block|title=5 Questions With George Lucas: Controversial ''Star Wars'' Changes, SOPA and ''Indiana Jones 5''|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/george-lucas-star-wars-interview-288523|accessdate=October 4, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Greedo had pointed a gun at Solo and bragged that he had been "looking forward" to seeing Solo's "dead body", constituting—according to at least one legal expert—a direct threat on Solo's life that would clearly warrant preemptive action on Solo's part in self-defense in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/12/ua_professor_han_solo_was_lega.html|title=UA Professor: Han Solo was legally justified to shoot first|last1=Gross|first1=John|website=AL.com|publisher=Alabama Media Group|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|1997 Special Edition rerelease]] of the film, a few frames are inserted in which Greedo shoots first at Solo and misses, and then Solo returns fire, killing Greedo.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Peter, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1035580321.html?dids=1035580321:1035580321&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+12%2C+2006&amp;author=Peter+Howell&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=At+last%2C+Han+shot+first&amp;pqatl=google "At last, Han shot first"], [[Toronto Star]], May 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tocci, Jason, [http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit5/papers/Tocci.pdf "The Well-Dressed Geek: Media Appropriation and Subcultural Style"], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], April 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film's 2004 DVD release, the scene was altered again, with new timing so that the shots are fired at nearly the same time and so that Solo dodges Greedo's shot. In an article titled "The ''Star Wars'' George Lucas Doesn't Want You To See", ''[[The Atlantic]]'' summarized that "[i]n the original versions ... it's clear that Han Solo pulled out his gun and shot the bounty hunter Greedo. In the 1997 version, Greedo shoots first. In the 2004 version, they shoot at the same time."&lt;ref name="Doesn't Want You2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-star-wars-george-lucas-doesnt-want-you-to-see/379184/|title=The ''Star Wars'' George Lucas Doesn't Want You To See|last=Eveleth|first=Rose|date=August 27, 2014|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011 [[Blu-ray]] release, the scene of Solo and Greedo firing at each other was shortened by several frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/star-wars-blu-ray-changes-2/112594/|title=More Changes to ''STAR WARS'' Include Blinking Ewoks and Different Cut of Greedo Shooting First|date=September 1, 2011|work=collider.com|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The change is one of the most controversial made in the [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|1997 Special Edition ''Star Wars'' rerelease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/31/17409740/solo-a-star-wars-story-han-shot-first|title=Solo: A Star Wars Story makes the ‘Han shot first’ debate even messier|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objection to the revision is that it alters Han's initially morally ambiguous character, making his later transition from [[anti-hero]] to [[hero]] less meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Sagers, Aaron, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/987468611.html?dids=987468611:987468611&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+15%2C+2006&amp;author=Aaron+Sagers+Of+Merge&amp;pub=Morning+Call&amp;desc=An+unbelievable+day+in+the+life+of+Jack+Bauer&amp;pqatl=google "An unbelievable day in the life of Jack Bauer"], [[The Morning Call]], February 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Variety,'' "Fans lost their minds.

In a 2004 interview, Lucas explained: "To me, [the original movie] doesn't really exist anymore. ... I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be."&lt;ref name="Lucas talks2"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Lucas|first=George|interviewer=Associated Press|title=Lucas talks as 'Star Wars' trilogy returns|url=http://www.today.com/id/6011380/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/lucas-talks-star-wars-trilogy-returns/|accessdate=December 18, 2015|location=San Rafael, CA|date=September 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Lucas stated that a combination of poor-quality close-up shots and the audience's inaccurate perception of the Han Solo character was what actually caused all the confusion. Lucas explained:

One draft of the original script makes no mention of Greedo shooting at all, only Solo.&lt;ref name="ANH script2"&gt;Star Wars: A New Hope script, Revised Fourth Draft.  January 15, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a replica of an early script for ''Star Wars'' was discovered in the archives of the [[University of New Brunswick]] library. In the script, dated March 15, 1976, Han shoots first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/original-star-wars-script-discovered-in-unb-library-1.3104206|title=Copy of original Star Wars script discovered in UNB library|date=June 8, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, asked by fans who shot first, actor [[Harrison Ford]] replied: "I don't know and I don't care."&lt;ref name="Who Shot First at MTV2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1726087/harrison-ford-star-wars-who-shot-first/|title=Harrison Ford Doesn't Know, Doesn't Care If Han Shot First|last=Wigler|first=Josh|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2014|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Blake (actor)|Paul Blake]], who played Greedo, said in a 2016 interview with the ''[[New York Daily News]]:'' "Of course, it said it all in the original script, we played in the scene in English and at the end of the scene, it reads, 'Han shoots the alien.' It's all it says and that's what happened. It was very painful.&lt;ref name="Sacks2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/greedo-actor-star-wars-restore-han-solo-shooting-article-1.2623730|title=EXCLUSIVE: Greedo actor wants 'Star Wars' to restore Han Solo shooting first scene: 'It does give him a little more glory'|last=Sacks|first=Ethan|date=May 5, 2016|newspaper=New York Daily News|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake felt that Greedo shooting and missing Solo at very short range made him appear inept, and that Greedo has more glory if he is "just blown away".&lt;ref name="Sacks2" /&gt;

In a 2015 interview for ''[[The Washington Post]],'' Lucas said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Han Solo was going to marry (Princess) [[Leia]], and you look back and say, 'Should he be a cold-blooded killer?'" Lucas asks. "Because I was thinking mythologically—should he be a [[cowboy]], should he be [[John Wayne]]? And I said, 'Yeah, he should be John Wayne.' And when you're John Wayne, you don't shoot people [first]—you let them have the first shot. It's a mythological reality that we hope our society pays attention to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 2018 film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo: A Star Wars Story,]]'' Han Solo shoots antagonist Tobias Beckett mid-sentence, killing him.&lt;ref name="Solo A Star Wars Story, Variety2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/solo-a-star-wars-story-han-shot-first-lawrence-jonathan-kasdan-1202812392/|title=How the Kasdans Settled the Biggest Debate in 'Star Wars' History With 'Solo'|last=Tapley|first=Kristopher|date=May 26, 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solo A Star Wars Story, Comic Book2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2018/05/28/solo-star-wars-story-han-shot-first-origin-beckett-death/|title='Solo: A Star Wars Story' Reveals Why Han Shot First|last=Outlaw|first=Kofi|date=May 28, 2018|accessdate=May 29, 2018|publisher=ComicBook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solo A Star Wars Story, CinemaBlend2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2425491/solo-a-star-wars-story-wants-to-make-it-clear-to-everyone-han-shot-first|title=Solo: A Star Wars Story Wants To Make It Clear To Everyone Han Shot First|last=Libbey|first=Dirk|date=May 27, 2018|accessdate=May 29, 2018|publisher=CinemaBlend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers [[Lawrence Kasdan|Lawrence]] and [[Jonathan Kasdan]] confirmed that this was a deliberate reference, and that the ''Solo'' shooting script specifies: "There can be no question that Han shoots first."&lt;ref name="Solo A Star Wars Story, Variety2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solo A Star Wars Story, CinemaBlend2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10799">'''Hypertext fiction''' is a genre of [[electronic literature]], characterized by the use of [[hypertext]] links that provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction. The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories.  Its spirit can also be seen in [[interactive fiction]].

The term can also be used to describe traditionally-published books in which a [[nonlinear narrative]] and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]]'s ''[[La Tournée de Dios]]'' (1932), [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941), [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962), [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Rayuela]]'' (1963; translated as ''Hopscotch''), and [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[The Castle of Crossed Destinies]]'' (1973) are early examples predating the word "[[Hypertext#History|hypertext]]", while a common pop-culture example is the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series in [[young adult fiction]] and other similar [[gamebook]]s. ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941) is both a hypertext story and is sometimes used as a description of having different possible paths.

== Definitions ==
There is little consensus on the definition of hypertext literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yellowlees |first=Jane Douglas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReMjJYdo2n0C&amp;pg=PA3 |page=3 |title=The End of Books—or Books Without End?: Reading Interactive Narratives |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2001 |isbn=0472088467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar term cybertext is often used interchangeably with hypertext.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, Espen.1997. ''ergodic Literature''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In hypertext fiction, the reader assumes a significant role in the creation of the narrative. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user,' just a 'reader,' this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what actions to take, what punches to punch, or when to jump.

To [[Espen Aarseth]], cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], [[Plain text|texts]] should be examined at a more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To Aarseth, hypertext fiction is a kind of '''[[ergodic literature]]''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt/extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Aarseth, the process of reading immersive narrative, in contrast, involves "trivial" effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages; the text does not resist the reader.

== History ==

The first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the [[World Wide Web]], using software such as [[Storyspace]] and [[HyperCard]]. Noted pioneers in the field are [[Judy Malloy]] and [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. 

[[Douglas Anthony Cooper|Douglas Cooper]]'s ''[[Delirium (Cooper novel)|Delirium]]'' (1994) was the first novel serialized on the World Wide Web; it permitted navigation between four parallel story strands. On June 21, 1996, Bobby Rabyd (aka [[Robert Arellano]]) published the World Wide Web's first interactive novel,&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarello, Lisa. [http://www.pifmagazine.com/2000/01/swiveling-my-hipsthrough-the-interbunk "Swiveling My Hips through the Interbunk (And Having a Great Time, Too)"]. Pif Magazine: January, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunshine 69'', with navigable maps of settings, a nonlinear calendar of scenes, and a character "suitcase" enabling readers to try on nine different points of view. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, [[Mark Amerika]] released ''GRAMMATRON'', a multi-linear work that was eventually exhibited in art galleries.  In 2000, it was included in the [[Whitney Museum|Whitney Biennial of American Art]].&lt;ref name="nytwhitneylist"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/120899whitney-list.html Artists Selected for the 2000 Whitney Biennial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. [[Linda Dement]]’s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster'' a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women’s body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher’s  hypertext novella “‘These Waves of Girls“ is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. It won the [[Electronic Literature Organization]] award.

Some other web examples of hypertext fiction include Adrienne Eisen's ''Six Sex Scenes'' (1995),
Stuart Moulthrop's ''Hegirascope'' (1995, 1997), ''The Unknown'' (which won the trAce(Alt X award in 1998), ''The Company Therapist'' (1996-1999) (which won Net Magazine's "Entertainment Site of the Year"), and Caitlin Fisher's ''These Waves of Girls'' (2001) (which won the ELO award for fiction in 2001). More recent works include Stephen Marche's "Lucy Hardin's Missing Period" (2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://walrusmagazine.com/lucyhardin/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul LaFarge|Paul La Farge’s]] * ''Luminous Airplanes''  (2011).

The internationally oriented, but US based, [[Electronic Literature Organization]] (ELO) was founded in 1999 to promote the creation and enjoyment of electronic literature. Other organisations for the promotion of electronic literature include trAce Online Writing Community, a British organisation, started in 1995, that has fostered electronic literature in the UK, Dichtung Digital, a journal of criticism of electronic literature in English and German, and ELINOR, a network for electronic literature in the Nordic countries, which provides a directory of Nordic electronic literature. The Electronic Literature Directory lists many works of electronic literature in English and other languages.

== Characteristics ==
Hypertext fiction is characterized by networked nodes of text making up a fictional story. There are often several options in each node that directs where the reader can go next. Unlike traditional fiction, the reader is not constrained by reading the fiction from start to end, depending on the choices they make. In this sense, it is similar to an encyclopaedia, with the reader reading a node and then choosing a link to follow. While this can be done more easily on paper, it is quite a different experience on a screen. The reader can be thrown into unpredictable loops because not all of the links are explained by their title. The fiction can contain text, quotes, and images.

There are different forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axial, arborescent, and networked. Axial hypertext fictions have a central story line with links that branch off and return to the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked fictions have multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext fiction can have a mixture of these three forms.

== Criticism ==
In 2013, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] published an article to describe why hypertext fiction did not become popular; it was because the non-linear stories are difficult to write, since each section of the work would need to introduce characters or concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2013/04/hypertext/ Why No One Clicked on the Great Hypertext Story] March 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, hypertext is widely used to tell linear stories on the Internet by using hypertext links to other articles or arguments that are written by different people.

[[Image:Marcello Benedetto.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Benedetto Marcello]]

'''''Il teatro alla moda''''' (The Fashionable Theater) is a satirical pamphlet in which its author, the Venetian composer [[Benedetto Marcello]] (1686–1739), vents his critical opinions on the ''milieu'' of the Italian ''[[opera seria]]'' in the first decades of the eighteenth century. It was first published anonymously in [[Venice]], by the end of 1720. Virtually every aspect of ''opera seria'' and its social environment is mercilessly criticized by Marcello: the [[artificiality]] of plots, the stereotyped format of music, the extravagant scenography and machinery, the inability and venality of composers and poets, the vanity and vulgarity of singers, the avidity of impresarios, the ineptitude of musicians.

The full title reads "THE FASHIONABLE THEATER – OR – safe and easy METHOD for correctly composing and performing Italian OPERAS in the modern style, – In which – useful and necessary Advice is given to Librettists, Composers, Musicians of both sexes, Impresarios, Performers, Engineers, and Scene Painters, comic Characters, Tailors, Pages, Dancers, Prompters, Copyists, Protectors, and MOTHERS of female Virtuoso singers, &amp; other People belonging to Theater." In fact, ''Il teatro alla moda'' is written as a series of chapters where advice is ironically given to the various people involved in operatic productions, in order to meet "the modern customs" and bizarre requirements of such theatrical events.

Besides the title, the frontispiece contains several allusions to well-known protagonists of the Venetian theater of the time. For instance, the publisher's name "Aldiviva Licante" refers, by means of anagrams, both to [[Antonio Vivaldi]], then very famous as an opera composer, and to the singer [[Caterina Canteli]].

The text of ''Il teatro alla moda'' displays several striking features. To begin with, it shows a degree of vacillation in attitude toward its subject — perhaps resulting from Marcello's personal ambivalence regarding operatic music, as both a critic and a composer. For example, the dedicatory is by "the author of the book to its composer." In addition, it exhibits a number of surrealistic elements, which reach a climax in the last chapter, "The Raffle" (presumably organized by the mother of a young female singer), where the prizes include "a full dress of modern poet in fever-colored tree bark, wrapped with metaphors, translations, hyperboles" as well as "the pen that wrote ''Il teatro alla moda''." The printing accompanies these peculiarities with a chaotic use of italic and normal typography and of capital fonts.

==Translated excerpts (typography preserved)==

"To the Poets – In the first place, the ''modern'' Poet should not have read and should never read the ancient Authors, ''Latin'' or ''Greek''. And this is because the ancient ''Greeks'' or ''Latins'' have never read the ''moderns''."

"To the Music Composers – The ''modern'' Music Composer should possess no knowledge about the ''Rules'' of good composition, except for some principle of universal practice... He should not understand the ''numeric Musical Proportions'', nor the optimal effect  of ''contrary Motions'', or the ''bad Relation'' of ''Tritones'' and ''augmented Intervals''."
 
"To the Singers – It is not necessary that the VIRTUOSO can ''read'', or ''write'', or have a ''good pronunciation of vowels, and of single and double Consonants, or understand the sense of Words'', etc., but it is better if he mistakes ''Senses, Letters, Syllables'', etc., in order to perform ''Ornaments, Trills, Appoggiature, very long Cadences'', etc. etc. etc."

"To the Mothers of Female Singers – When the ''Girls'' have an audition with the Impresario, ''they'' (the mothers) ''will move the mouth with them'', will ''prompt'' them the usual ''Ornaments'' and ''Trills'' and, asked about the age of the ''Virtuosa'', will cut down at least ''ten years''."

'''Jean-Pierre Ponnelle''' (19 February 1932 – 11 August 1988) was a French opera [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenographer]] and [[costume designer]].

==Biography==
Ponnelle was born in Paris. He studied philosophy, art, and history there and, in 1952, began his career in Germany as a theatre designer for [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s opera ''[[Boulevard Solitude]]''. He was greatly influenced by the work of art director [[Georges Wakhévitch]] who also designed sets and costumes for the theatre, the ballet, and the opera.

In 1962, Ponnelle directed his first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in [[Düsseldorf]]. His production of that opera at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1981 was widely praised as one of the most aesthetically beautiful in its history.

His work throughout the world included stage productions at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[San Francisco Opera]]; productions for television (a ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' in 1974 notable for performances by [[Mirella Freni]] and the young [[Plácido Domingo]]); and filmed versions of operas such as the well-known [[Karl Böhm]]-conducted ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. His 1969 production of [[Mozart]]'s then neglected ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'' for [[Cologne]] helped re-establish this work in the repertory. Ponnelle also was a frequent guest at the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/dieinstitution/geschichte/  Salzbug Festival website (in English)] Retrieved 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, his productions were controversial. His 1986 ''[[Aida]]'' at [[Covent Garden]], in which he replaced the usual ballet dancers with young boys, was soundly booed and never revived, though his earlier ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' at the same theatre had been a triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, ''San Francisco Chronicle'': "Welcome as it may be to find Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's infamous 1975 Eurotrash production of the work, presented as "The Steersman's Dream", (which held the War Memorial stage for three of the company's five presentations of the piece) banished, presumably forever, it can still be a strain to discern ''Dutchman''.&lt;/ref&gt; as were his interpretations of well-known works.
&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Andrew, ''The Times'': "Only in recent years have directors taken it upon themselves to rewrite Wagner's stage actions, to intervene, to move from simplification to new invention. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's idea at Bayreuth, in 1981, was that Isolde should not appear in Act Three but be an off-stage voice sounding in Tristan's mind"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatfield-Taylor, p. 63: "Some critics felt that there was...perversity in Ponnelle's conception of ''(Rigoletto)'' as a flashback that begins with Gilda already dead, lying on the floor during the Prelude".&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Munich]], Germany in 1988 of a [[pulmonary embolism]] following a tragic fall into the orchestra pit during rehearsals for a production of ''Carmen'' with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Zubin Mehta]]. His son is the orchestra conductor [[Pierre-Dominique Ponnelle]] and his nephew is [[Jean Pierre Danel]].

'''Khyber Arts Society''' is a not-for profit charitable organization that operates the Khyber Centre for the Arts, an [[Canadian artist-run centres|artist-run centre]] located at 1880 Hollis St. in downtown Halifax NS, which is K’jipuktuk, unceded Mi’kmaq territory. The name “Khyber” commemorates the café owned and operated by the Nasr family in the old "[[The Khyber]] Building" at 1588 Barrington St., named for the Khyber Pass, a mountain pass that connects Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

== Mandate ==

The Khyber’s mandate is to present contemporary visual art, which exists in a wide variety of disciplines. We challenge traditional gallery conventions, encourage public understanding and appreciation of contemporary art through responsive and relevant programming. The Khyber works to prioritize, centre and promote the presentation of work by emerging local, national and/or international artists. Additionally, we aim to recognize and disrupt systemic forms of oppression, which include but are not limited to: racism, white supremacy, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism/transmisogyny, tokenism, ableism, ageism, sizeism, sexualized and all acts of violence and harassment. This will be implemented through anti-oppressive policy and practices through Khyber programming, operating and in relation to staff, Board members and artists presented. The Khyber provides a physical and flexible space for the support of socially-engaged Primary and Membership programming, as well as cultivating relationships with a variety of arts communities that engage in artistic research, experimentation, production, education and distribution.

== History ==

In 1994, [[The Khyber]] Building was operated as an arts facility by a group of artists&lt;ref name="5e-rep"&gt;{{cite book|others=Regroupement des centres d'artistes autogérés du Québec|title=5e répertoire des centres d'artistes autogérés du Québec et du Canada|publisher=RCAAQ|year=2002|pages=257/259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIlPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Khyber+Arts+Society%22&amp;dq=%22Khyber+Arts+Society%22|accessdate=1 September 2009|language=English, French}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as the No Money Down Cultural Society&lt;ref name="cultureandcommunities.ca"&gt;http://www.cultureandcommunities.ca/resources/cultural-facility-profiles/cultural-spaces-community-impacts/khyber.html&lt;/ref&gt;. They led a widespread and collaborative community campaign to ensure continued public access to "[[The Khyber]] Building" which was at risk of closer.

In March 1995, the Khyber Arts Society was established to operate The Khyber Centre for the Arts, a [[Canadian artist-run centres|Canadian artist-run centre]].&lt;ref name="5e-rep"/&gt; 

In 1997, the Society signed a lease to occupy the Khyber Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/MQ63531.pdf|last=Kim|first=Joo-Hwan|date=July 2001|title=ETHOS:ART GALLERY, STUDIO AND HOUSING FOR ARTISTS|publisher=[[National Library of Canada]]|pages=17–18|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Khyber Club opened as a meeting place for visual artists and as an important venue for Halifax's emerging music scene&lt;ref name="cultureandcommunities.ca"/&gt; including acts by now well established Canadian recording artists [[Joel Plaskett]], [[Jenn Grant]], [[Old Man Luedecke]] and [[Buck 65]].

[[Sobey Art Award]] nominee, [[Emily Vey Duke]], was Artistic Director for the Society in 2004.

The Khyber Arts Society based its contemporary art programming out of "[[The Khyber]] Building"  until 2014, when the city required all tenants to leave.

In April 2014, the organization was temporarily relocated to 5521 Cornwallis St.

In November 2015, the organization moved to 1880 Hollis St. where it currently operates The Khyber Centre for the Arts and has continued to serve many artists and communities, offering an increasingly rigorous public program.

== Charitable Status ==

The Khyber Arts Society is a registered Canadian charitable organization.

'''Lambert de Hondt the Elder''' or '''Lambert de Hondt (I)''' (c. 1620 - before 10 February 1665) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman mainly known for his equestrian and [[military art|battle]] scenes as well as his [[genre art|genre]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] paintings.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/39415 Lambert de Hondt (I)] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Only a few details about de Hondt’s life have been preserved.  He is recorded as working in [[Mechelen]].  Since his widow remarried on 10 February 1665, we know he died before that date.  He is sometimes confused with another artist who signed his paintings with L. de Hondt.&lt;ref name=wel&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=190641 Lambert de Hondt (I) - An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards], at vads&lt;/ref&gt;  This other artist who also specialised in battle scenes and made designs for tapestries around 1700 is referred to as [[Lambert de Hondt the Younger]].  It is not known whether the two artists were related.

De Hondt must have enjoyed high-level patronage as one of his paintings (''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards.jpg|An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards]]'', now at the Wellington Museum, [[Apsley House]], London) is marked with a white ''fleur-de-lis'', and originally had a coat of arms on the back.  This indicates that the painting was in the collection of [[Elisabeth Farnese]].&lt;ref name=wel/&gt;
==Work==
[[File:Lambert de Hondt (I) - Battle Scene.jpg|thumb|''Battle Scene'']]
He was probably responsible for the compositions depicting military camps, cavalry and military convoys and battles signed L.D. HONDT.  These paintings are reminiscent of the manner of [[David Teniers the Younger]].  In his military scenes he often used a sketchy technique.&lt;ref name=wel/&gt; His paintings often depict horses and cavalry.  He also painted village scenes (such as ''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - The Vegetable Vendor.jpg|The Vegetable Vendor]]''), hunting scenes (such as ''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - A Hunting Scene.jpg|A Hunting Scene]]'') and landscapes.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;
 
As was the custom at the time, he regularly collaborated with other painters.  He worked with [[Willem van Herp]] in the production of landscapes (painted by de Hondt) with figures (painted by van Herp) such as ''Noah gathering his Family and the Animals on the Ark'', ''Orpheus charming the animals'', ''St. Francis with the Animals'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proantic.com/display.php?mode=obj&amp;id=84714 Lambert de Hondt l’ancien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030203317/http://www.proantic.com/display.php?mode=obj&amp;id=84714 |date=30 October 2014 }} at pro antic {{link language|fr|French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These paintings are similar in composition and are a variation of the type of the so-called 'paradise landscape'.  Paradise landscapes depict the [[Garden of Eden]] as described in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'', filled with all the animals, fish and birds that were believed to be God’s creation.  The type was invented and popularized by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]. Jan Brueghel was employed at the court of the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]] in [[Brussels]], who maintained an extensive animal menagerie.  He was also a native of [[Antwerp]], a major port city and trading center for exotic goods and animals from Asia and the New World.  Jan Brueghel  was thus in an ideal position to study many domestic and exotic animal species and include them in his compositions.  De Hondt was manifestly inspired by Brueghel’s paradise landscapes such as Brueghel's ''[[:image:Jan Brueghel the Younger Creation of Adam.jpg|The Creation of Adam]]'' and ''[[:image:Jan Breughel de Jonge - De vermelding van de dieren in de ark van Noach.jpg|The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark]]''.  He was clearly also familiar with Rubens’ animal scenes as his depiction of the lions in his ‘paradise paintings’ resemble those of Rubens in the painting ''[[:Image:Daniel in the Lion's Den c1615 Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|Daniel in the Lion's Den]]''.

He occasionally painted on copper, a support which offered a perfectly smooth surface allowing the precise detail of the paradise paintings.&lt;ref name=haldane&gt;[http://www.haldanefineart.com/cataloguing/de-hondt-lambert-saint-francis.html Lambert de Hondt the Elder (before 1622-before 1655) and Willem van Herp the Elder (1613/14-1677), ''Saint Francis with the Animals''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102050630/http://www.haldanefineart.com/cataloguing/de-hondt-lambert-saint-francis.html |date=2 November 2014 }} at Haldane Fine Art&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4757">'''Lumia''' is a form of [[art]] that uses [[light]]; originally associated with music but was later associated with painting. The term was coined by a 20th-century artist, [[Thomas Wilfred]].&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Color, Form, and Motion: Dimensions of a Musical Art of Light|journal=Leonardo|volume=2000|issue=355|pages=355–356|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century artists began to promote colors and light together in their artworks.&lt;ref name="Esk Framework"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eskilan|first1=Stephen|title=Thomas Wilfred and Intermedia: Seeking a Framework for Lumia|journal=Leonardo|volume=2003|issue=65|pages=65–68|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfred worked towards establishing lumia as a new form of art but the term never caught on. Despite creating the term lumia, Wilfred did not create the use of light in art.

== Thomas Wilfred ==
Thomas Wilfred, (1889–1968), was the first artist in the United States to use light as the sole means of expression for his artwork. He consistently used colored light in his works. Wilfred was born in [[Denmark]] in 1889 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1916. Wilfred explored light and color in art as early as 1905. In 1921, Wilfred created his first portable [[clavilux]], a machine that allowed for the creation and performance of lumia. Clavilux is a term in Latin that means "light played by key". In 1930 Wilfred founded a center for research in lumia, the Art Institute of Light. The institute closed down during World War ll. In the early 1930s he transitioned from the musical aspect of lumia to painting.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Wilfred planned to turn lumia into a formal art form, an "eighth art"; Wilfred wanted lumia to be its own art form of expression.

== Lumia ==
The three main elements of lumia, defined by Wilfred, are form, color, and motion in a dark space. The most important are said to be form and motion. Wilfred's original contribution to lumia was the introduction of a fourth dimension - time. Since 1924, lumia accompanied music, dance, and drama.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Museum of Modern Art|title=Thomas Wilfred: Lumia|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4690/releases/MOMA_1971_0127_89A.pdf?2010|website=https://www.moma.org|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Musical aspects ===
In a musical sense, Lumia is used to accompany music by adding a visual effect. Wilfred mentioned that Lumia has three factors, "Form, color, and motion are the three basic factors in lumia - as in all visual experience - and form and motion are the two most important."&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this" /&gt;

==== Clavilux ====
A term also coined by Thomas Wilfred to refer to his invention that allowed the creation and performance of Lumia. [[Clavilux]] means "light played by key" in Latin. The term used by other artists was known as color organ. 
	
==== Light Organ ====
Louis-Bertrand Castel invented the first light organ in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Synth Collopy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Improvisational Lumia: Painting along with Musicians|journal=Leonardo|volume=2001|issue=353|page=353|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For more information check [[light organ]] or [[color organ]].

=== Painting aspects ===
There are different forms of art that use light as a medium:
	
==== Light art ====
[[Light art]] is an art form that focuses on the expression of light. Light art includes stained glass which transmits light through colored glass. This type of art dates back to the 4th century. This art is found in churches and mosques with stained glass windows. Another used of light art is shadow puppetry in which shadows can create moving images. This art can be dated back to 380 BC by the use of Plato in the Allegory of the cave. Light art is even used in modern photography and motion pictures which uses artificial light to help captures images. Artists recognized for their use of light include [[James Turrell]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Dan Flavin]],  [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Leo Villareal]], and [[Mel and Dorothy Tanner]].
	
==== Light painting ====
[[Light painting]] is a term used for a photographic technique. It is done by moving a light source or the camera while taking a long exposure photograph to produce a light painting. This creates a photograph that looks like it was painted with light. Painting with a light source dates back to 1889.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===

{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger.

Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

Mancini |year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'' calls Piero the "greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, G. |title=Le Opere, volume 2 |editor=G. Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the golden section in some parts of Kairouan mosque indicates that the elements designed and generated with this principle may have been realised at the same period. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004154727/http://www.nexusjournal.com/BouMaz.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brinkworth, Peter |author2=Scott, Paul |title=The Place of Mathematics |journal=Australian Mathematics Teacher |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=2001 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of architecture [[Frederik Macody Lund]] argued in 1919 that the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] (12th century), [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] (1157–1205) and [[Notre Dame de Paris]] (1160) are designed according to the [[golden ratio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chanfón Olmos, Carlos |title=Curso sobre Proporción.

===Planar symmetries===

[[File:Carpet with Double Medallion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Powerful presence:&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; carpet with double medallion. Central [[Anatolia]] (Konya – Karapınar), turn of the 16th/17th centuries. [[Alâeddin Mosque]]]]

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful?

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s.

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nguyen Trinh Thi''' (born in 1973)&lt;ref name="asianartbiennial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianartbiennial.org/2015/content/EN/ArtistWork.aspx?enc=S61yqjC//dTMPLzPMMsPwA==|title=2015 亞洲藝術雙年展 國立臺灣美術館|publisher=asianartbiennial.org|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Hanoi-based independent [[filmmaker]], [[documentarian]], and [[video artist]].

Nguyen Trinh Thi is known for her layered, personal, and poetic approach to contentious histories and current events through experiments with the [[moving image]]. Her practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced, or misinterpreted histories, often making use of original [[documentary]] [[footage]] or undertaking extensive investigative [[field work]]. Inspired by her heritage, her pieces are powerful and haunting, and focus on social and cultural issues — especially the complex, traumatic history of her home country [[Vietnam]] and its after-effects in the present.&lt;ref name="10chancerylanegallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10chancerylanegallery.com/artists/main/Nguyen_Trinh_Thi/en/|title=10 Chancery Lane Gallery &amp;#124; Nguyen Trinh Thi|author=Web Design by Hodfords Production - www.hodfords.com|publisher=10chancerylanegallery.com|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her materials are diverse – from [[video]] and [[photographs]] shot by herself to those appropriated from various sources including press photos, corporate videos, and classic films; her practice traverses boundaries between [[film]] and [[video art]], [[installation art|installation]] and [[performance]].&lt;ref name="san-art"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://san-art.org/producer/nguyen-trinh-thi/|title=Sàn Art &amp;#124; Nguyen Trinh Thi|publisher=san-art.org|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work examines issues concerning society and history — especially the complex, traumatic history of her home country Vietnam and its after-effects in the present. In her longer documentary films, she employs calm and quiet visuals while eschewing voiceovers in order to let the people of her country speak directly to the camera. Her diverse practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced or misinterpreted histories; and examined the position of artists in the Vietnamese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de/en/gast.php?id=1275|title=Berliner Künstlerprogramm {{!}} Biography: Trinh Thi, Nguyen|website=www.berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as one of the pioneers of Viêt Nam’s independent cinema, Thi is the most notable video artist on Viêt Nam’s contemporary art scene. She plays an important role the country’s cinema; with works projected in international festivals and exhibitions. After studying journalism and photography at the University of Iowa; and international studies and ethnographic film at University of California, San Diego, she decided to return to Vietnam to pursue a career as an independent filmmaker at a time when this concept was still foreign and filmmaking was very difficult due to censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diacritics.org/2013/01/inauguration-of-cycle-84-a-hub-of-cinema-in-paris/|title=The Films of Nguyen Trinh Thi at Cycle 84–a hub of Cinema in Paris|last=|first=|date=2013-01-24|work=diaCRITICS|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thi returned to her home country, Vietnam, after spending many years in the United States, where she studied journalism and filmmaking among other things. Here, documentary films had primarily been a domain of the Vietnam Documentary &amp; Scientific Studio, which produces films by order of the government. A free documentary film scene was practically non-existent, which was due to numerous causes: There was no access to work opportunities, production budgets and distribution channels, as well as to training opportunities, contacts to the international scene and knowledge about the development trends of documentary films elsewhere in the world. This was augmented by the pressure of censorship and the lack of interest of the general public, which equated documentary films with propaganda. So there were many different obstacles preventing a documentary film culture from developing in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/prj/ken/qua/pwe/en9222075.htm|title=Home - Capacity Building - International Projects - Goethe-Institut|website=www.goethe.de|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thi worked together with a group of filmmakers and artists to elaborate a concept for a centre for documentary films and video art, described as "a centre with its focus on education, art, research and experimentation". The name was suddenly there, DocLab, a lab for experiments and a Vietnamese play with the sound of words and their meanings, and the right place was also found promptly: in the building of the Hanoi Goethe Institute, as, due to the cultural agreement, this was the only place with free access and a censure-free area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite considerable resistance, Thi and a small group of Vietnamese filmmakers and artists have succeeded in building a centre step by step with the help of the Goethe Institute which provides training and promotes exchange in the area of documentary films besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international scene, thereby pushing open a door to the world for Vietnamese documentary films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/prj/ken/qua/pwe/en9222075.htm|title=Home - Capacity Building - International Projects - Goethe-Institut|website=www.goethe.de|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she founded Hanoi Independent Documentary &amp; Experimental Filmmakers Forum (Hi-DEFF) to encourage independent filmmaking in Vietnam and collaborations among artists, filmmakers and others that holds biweekly documentary and experimental film screenings in Hanoi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanoidoclab.org/en/about-doclab/about-us/|title=About us|website=www.hanoidoclab.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyen is the founding director of Hanoi DocLab (2009), a centre which provides training besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international documentary scene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/prj/ken/qua/pwe/en9222075.htm|title=Home - Capacity Building - International Projects - Goethe-Institut|website=www.goethe.de|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where she continues to teach today. '''DOCLAB'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is a center/lab for documentary filmmaking and video art opened in October 2009 and based at the Goethe Institute in Hanoi. Our activities include:

• Basic film and video training courses

• Editing, sound-designing and writing workshops

• Weekly screenings and discussions opened for everyone

• Editing lab for filmmakers and video artists

• Video/film and book library accessible to the public

In a 2017 interview&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2017/12/17/curiosity-and-the-role-of-the-artist-vietnamese-artist-and-filmmaker-nguyen-trinh-thi-interview/|title=Curiosity and the role of the artist: Vietnamese artist and filmmaker Nguyen Trinh Thi – interview {{!}} Art Radar|website=artradarjournal.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Art Radar'' when asked, "Do you think that it is part of the role of the artist in Southeast Asia to create platforms for public exposure in the arts?" 

She answered: DOCLAB came out of a need to start a community. Before I moved back to Vietnam, there were not many independent artist communities in Hanoi. Community is very important when you work as an independent artist. When I lived in Los Angeles, I was close to the Echo Park Film Center and it was very inspiring for me. When I moved back to Hanoi, I became involved in different film projects and learned more about the local conditions through those experiences. When the Goethe Institute offered a grant to do something in documentary film, I already had an idea about what we needed locally and the best approach to take in building such an organisation. Over the years, DOCLAB became a complete system with training courses, screenings, exchange, and now we even have festivals. I taught there for the first three years but now I’ve stopped to focus on my own work

In a 2010 interview&lt;ref&gt;"DISPATCH." Interview by Zoe Butt. ''INDEPENDENT CURATORS INTERNATIONAL'', April 1, 2010, 1-4. Accessed November 18, 2018. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://curatorsintl.org/images/uploads/DISPATCH_Nguyen.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; when asked "what affect do you think this will have on the nurturing of film practice and screening in Vietnam?"

I don't have any ambitions in changing the film practice in Vietnam. This is a very small effort; it won't change the industry a bit. I'm also not training professional people. I hope to give people larger exposure to practices of documentary filmmaking in the world, encourage them to create and think for themselves. Actually people who come to the training and screenings come from all kinds of disciplines. We're also hoping to nurture a local audience with a more critical awareness of documentary and experimental film, and video art.

== Styles and Themes ==
Nguyen’s works dealt with unspoken histories in Vietnam and called into question national agendas and societal norms. Her nuanced treatment of provocative and political content encapsulates the complexities of Southeast Asian history and the perplexing (and sometimes frustrating) role of the artist working within this multi-faceted sociopolitical framework&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Trinh Thi is interested in History, the Truth, in taboo subjects. She gives voice to marginalized people in society, to those who have suffered trauma in the past. She is a filmmaker who dares to question the country’s history, one that differs from the reconstruction produced by propaganda. Trinh Thi leads searches not only for reality, but is also for images. In her quest, she is constantly experimenting with new structures, formal tests on her creative path. She goes from the live-movie (Love man love woman) to found-footage thumbnail (Song to the front), from experimental documentary (Chronicle of a Tape Recorded Over) to video installations (Unsubtitled, Que faire). At the core of her work, a progressive exploration of her personal vision, Trinh Thi pays attention to gestural details, to the expressive faces of people who expose themselves and emerge out of the backdrop of a chaotic world. Her gaze is silent, anxious, humanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diacritics.org/2013/01/inauguration-of-cycle-84-a-hub-of-cinema-in-paris/|title=The Films of Nguyen Trinh Thi at Cycle 84–a hub of Cinema in Paris|date=2013-01-24|work=diaCRITICS|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and Education ==
Nguyen Trinh Thi studied [[journalism]], photography, international relations, and [[ethnographic film]] in the United States. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian and English from Hanoi Foreign Studies College, Hanoi, in 1994; a Master's Degree in Professional Journalism, [[University of Iowa]], Iowa City, in 1999; and Master of Pacific International Affairs, [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), in 2005.

In 2009, Nguyen founded and directs Hanoi DocLab, an educational center and studio for the production of documentary films and video art in Hanoi.

==Work==

=== ''Letters from Panduranga'' (2015) ===
Through a network of [[Champa]] scholars, Nguyen spent a number of residency periods in [[Ninh Thuận Province|Ninh Thuan]] between 2013 and 2015. ''Letters from Panduranga'' extends her experimentation between documentary and fiction in an essay film portraying a Cham community living in the most southern and last surviving territory of Champa, an ancient kingdom dating back nearly two thousand years and conquered by [[Dai Viet]] (present day [[Vietnam]]) in 1832. The essay film, made in the form of a letter exchange between two filmmakers, was inspired by the fact that the Vietnamese government is to build Vietnam’s first two [[nuclear power plants]] in Ninh Thuan, right at the spiritual heart of the Cham people, threatening the survival of this ancient matriarchal Hindu culture. Public discussions regarding the project have been largely absent in Vietnam due to strict government controls over public speech and media, and local communities have also been excluded from consultations.&lt;ref name="awarewomenartists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awarewomenartists.com/en/2737/|title=Colonial Persistence: Leonor Antunes and Nguyen Trinh Thi - AWARE|publisher=awarewomenartists.com|accessdate=2016-01-17}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film alludes to the legacy of war and colonialism; exploring and reflecting on landscape and portrait, documentary and fiction, and art and ethnography as methods of working in film and art, and their limitations in accessing other cultures, peoples, and experiences, as well as history and the past.
Nguyen Trinh Thi says, “As artists, we have contradictory desires: to be engaged, but also to disappear.”
Among other references are facts relating to the United States’ destructive bombing during the [[Vietnam War]], artifacts from colonial exhibitions and art collections, the vulgar place of tourists and the cultural policies of [[UNESCO]], and quotes from one of Nguyen’s main influences, [[Chris Marker]], notably his film essay ''Letter from Siberia'' (1957), and ''[[Statues Also Die]]'' (1953), both of which were incisive and novel in their critique of the impacts of industrial and colonial movements.

In previously mentioned Art Radar interview&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; it was asked: In ''Letters from Panduranga'', you said you did not want to speak on behalf of the “other” – the Cham community. However, they are part of contemporary Vietnam and their history has been subsumed into Vietnamese history. Why were you nervous to represent the Cham people?

To which Nguyen responded: Although we are all part of Vietnam now, we belong to very different groups. Vietnam is a national group, but there are so many methods of categorisation. My biggest concern was that I was imposing my perspective and vision on them. After the trip, I made a version that was more like a documentary, but I didn’t like it. It felt like the film was pretending to be objective, without really reflecting the depth and complexity of the story. ''Letters from Panduranga'' is not a film solely about the Cham people. I tried to connect their struggle to a broader issue – suppression of our voices. As I mentioned earlier, the underlying theme is power structures and who can use the image.

=== ''Song to the Front'' (2011–2012) ===
Nguyen Trinh Thi re-edited the historical Vietnamese war film, ''Bài Ca Ra Trận'', which was originally produced in 1973 by the Vietnam Feature Film Studio. She transformed the obscure black-and-white classic into a vignette that deconstructed the melodramatic and romanticized elements of social-realist drama.

An original Northern Vietnamese film, ''Song to the Front'' is a propagandist story of patriotism, a typical genre of this style of cinema that glorifies the heroic struggle of the proletariat class. Nguyen uses a form of suspense editing akin to the mastery of [[Hitchcock]], where the composition of the lens, grade of color, and sound dramatizes the narrative. In Nguyen’s edit, this near-blinded young man is shown as a human being with emotion who transforms into a fighting machine. A starry-lit sky cuts in and then a series of birds take flight. This young man’s eyes may be bandaged but his memories give him strength. After receiving surgery for his battle wounds, this heroic soldier is very weak with poor sight, but determined to continue to fight. The piece ends with the sounds of firing bullets and a young man’s crazed glee at qualifying as marksman to return to the front with a gun in his hands.

Nguyen extrapolates the central narrative of the film into a five-minute abstraction, her jump cuts and use of still frames are heightened with her use of [[Stravinsky]]’s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', referring to the ritual in pre-Christian Russia where a young girl dances herself to death – a vision that Stravinsky claimed was to propitiate the god of Spring. For Nguyen, these young soldiers who gave their lives for their country are the sacrificed pagans.&lt;ref name="proa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proa.org/eng/exhibition-afi-artistas-y-obras-nguyen-trinh-thi.php|title=Nguy&amp;ecirc;n Trinh Thi - Artists &amp;amp; Works - Artists' Film International - Exhibitions &amp;#124; Fundaci&amp;oacute;n Proa|publisher=proa.org|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her version of ‘Song to the Front’ plays with the original plot line in a deliberately ambiguous manner, designing an imaginative space for the viewer to reinterpret what were intended to be very literal epics that enforce an ideological view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proa.org/eng/exhibition-afi-artistas-y-obras-nguyen-trinh-thi.php|title=Nguyên Trinh Thi - Artists &amp; Works - Artists' Film International - Exhibitions {{!}} Fundación Proa|last=www.kells.com.ar|first=Kells,|website=proa.org|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series: "Unsubtitled" (2010), "Que faire" (2012), and "Solo for a Choir" (2013)===
In this series, Nguyen explores the possibilities for combining video installation with performance art, and of preserving differences of individuals while creating a sense of collective experience. Nguyen worked on a long-term film project about the [[Nhân Văn–Giai Phẩm affair]] – the suppressed literary movement of the 1950's and the only instance of widespread intellectual dissidence ever to occur in North Vietnam – and its legacy of dissent in Vietnamese art over the past five decades. Thematically, she continues to study these issues and reflects on the history and development of the role and position of the artist in Vietnamese society and issues related to Vietnam’s problems concerning censorship and artist freedom of expression. Nguyen invited nineteen Hanoi artists who make up the social constellation of [[Nha San Studio]] to face the camera, eat a food item of their choice, and to then state their name followed by the food item they had just consumed. Individually, these are statements parodying the Maoist practice of self-criticism, interrogation sessions where the artist in question must unequivocally explain the meaning of his work. Collectively, the chorus evokes a quiet protest against the long-running methods of surveillance and intimidation that are still pervasive in Vietnam.

===''Landscape Series #1'' (2013)===
Nguyen’s ''Landscape Series #1'' (2013) meditates on the idea of the landscape "as the silent witness of history.” During her search for photos, Nguyen came across hundreds of images of unidentified people in landscapes in the same position: pointing to indicate a past event, the location of something gone, something lost or missing. In these images, the figures are all in a similar pose, pointing at something unseen in the distance – a drama, a disappearance, a tragic episode, something that clearly seems to represent a past or a present threat, a yawning gap – which, since it cannot be seen, can only be pointed out. Together these anonymous witnesses, portrayed in compelling uniformity by innumerable Vietnamese press photographers, seem to be indicating a direction, a way forward out of the past, a fictional journey.&lt;ref name="biennaledelyon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biennaledelyon.com/uk/la-vie-moderne-home-eng/artists/nguyen-trinh-thi-eng.html|title=&amp;lt;02.&amp;gt; Artists - Nguyen Trinh Thi|publisher=biennaledelyon.com|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Love Man Love Woman'' (2007)===
Nguyen's documentary ''Love Man Love Woman'' (2007) explores the lives of gay men in Vietnam and focuses on the prevalent theme of repression in society. The film portrays master Luu Ngoc Duc, a famous spirit medium in Hanoi, as well the Mother Goddess cult in Vietnam, whose communities offer a haven to many gay Vietnamese. The Dong Co, or the religion’s priestesses, perform rites and rituals that include dazzling altars, flamboyant costumes, candles, incense, sequins, and feathers.&lt;ref name="berliner-kuenstlerprogramm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de/en/gast.php?id=1275|title=Berliner K&amp;uuml;nstlerprogramm &amp;#124; Biography: Trinh Thi, Nguyen|publisher=berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love Man Love Woman'' is not an ethnographic film about the Dao Mau community. The essence of the film is Master Luu Ngoc Duc, a spirit medium of the religion. He has a very rich Vietnamese vocabulary and was always quoting literature, poetry and folk phrases. It is amazing to watch him talk, and that kind of language is dying. Young people don’t talk like that anymore, even I find my Vietnamese so poor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Notability''' is the property of being worthy of notice, having fame, or being considered to be of a high degree of interest, significance, or distinction. It also refers to the capacity to be such. Persons who are notable due to public responsibility, accomplishments, or, even, mere participation in the [[celebrity]] industry are said to have a public profile.&lt;ref name=UKLeveson&gt;{{cite web|title=446 PART F {{!}} The Cultur e, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc07/0780/0780_ii.pdf|work=The Leveson Inquiry|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=April 22, 2013|page=445|quote=The category of people with a public profile also includes a third sub-group: individuals who are famous only for their celebrity, or put another way the mere fact of their having entered the public eye. These people are those who actively participate in the ‘celebrity industry,’ actively pursuing publicity’s sake, employing publicists to provide a steady stream of stories to the press and to inform paparazzi of their whereabouts, in order to ensure that they continue to appear in the public eye.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aesthetic theory ==
The concept arises in the philosophy of [[aesthetics]] regarding aesthetic appraisal.&lt;ref Name=AA&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3749507 Aesthetic Appraisal]'', Philosophy (1975), 50: 189-204, Evan Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; There are criticism of art galleries determining monetary valuation, or valuation so as to determine what or what not to display, being based on notability of the artist, rather than inherent quality of the art work.

== Journalism and marketing ==
Notability arises in decisions on coverage questions in [[journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Journalism in the age of the information society, technological convergence, and editorial segmentation'', Journalism February 2009 vol. 10 no. 1 109-125, Francisco José Castilhos Karam {{DOI|10.1177/1464884908098323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and newspapers may try to create notability to create [[celebrity]], [[Celebrity|fame]], or [[wikt:notoriety|notoriety]], or to increase sales, as in the [[yellow press]].

== Notables as the privileged class ==
The privileged class are sometimes called notables, when compared to peasants.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/179328 Notability and Revolution: Social Origins of the Political Elite in Liberal Spain, 1800 to 1853]'', Jesus Cruz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Notables and Arab nationalism: the politics of Damascus 1860-1920'', PS Khoury, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-521-53323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikipedia content ==
{{main|Notability in Wikipedia}}
Notability of a subject determines which articles will be included or not at Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman Lichtenstein, Craig M. Parker, "Wikipedia model for collective intelligence: a review of information quality" ''[[International Journal of Knowledge and Learning]]'', Volume 5, Number 3-4 / 2009, pp. 254-272 {{DOI|10.1504/IJKL.2009.031199}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Wikipedia Revolution]]: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia'', [[Andrew Lih]] writes that notability is at the center of the debate as to what the world's greatest encyclopedia should be - {{Quote|''"One faction believes Wikipedia should contain pretty much anything, as long as it’s factual and verifiable.... On the other side of the debate are the ‘deletionists’, although this somewhat unfairly characterizes their view in a destructive way. Some prefer the word ‘exclusionists’. This camp believes it is important to strictly determine not only whether something is factual, but whether it is notable, whether it is worthy of being included in the pantheon of human knowledge..... At the center of the debate is notability, which is where inclusionists and deletionists have their skirmishes.&lt;ref name=WR&gt;Andrew Lih, Jimmy Wales ''The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia'', 2009, p. 116 {{OCLC|488343590}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emily Artinian compares this passage with [[Borges]]' ''[[The Library of Babel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Artinian "[http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/contrad09/conpdfs/artiniantalk.pdf Wikipedia Definitions of the Artist’s Book: a Neutral Point of View?]" &lt;small&gt;({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903232044/http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/contrad09/conpdfs/artiniantalk.pdf |date=3 September 2013 }})&lt;/small&gt;, ''Traditional and Emerging Formats of the Book Conference'', University of the West of England, 9 July 2009, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons wanting to delete an article on the grounds of non-notability are called [[meta:deletionism|deletionists]]. Those not wanting to delete the article are called [[meta:inclusionism|inclusionists]].&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

A team of [[computer scientist]]s at [[MIT]] and [[Rutgers University]] has used notability at Wikipedia to create a measure of hierarchy in a directed [[online social network]].&lt;ref&gt;Mangesh Gupte, Pravin Shankar, Jing Li, S. Muthukrishnan, Liviu Iftode, "[http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~iftode/www11_socialhierarchy.pdf Finding Hierarchy in Directed Online Social Networks]" ACM 978-1-4503-0632-4/11/03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of hits from a search engine has been proposed as a measure of notability; Wikipedia does not recommend the use of Google's results.&lt;ref&gt;T Lawrence, N Pelkey, "[http://iczn.org/sites/iczn.org/files/BZN%2067(3)%20Comment%20on%20Case%203463.pdf 'Googleology': powerful tool or unreliable evidence?]" ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'', Volume 67, Number 3, September 2010, p. 26,&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[citation]]s has been proposed as a measure of notability of a publication or author; the field of study is called [[citation analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Clarke, "[http://www.rogerclarke.com/SOS/AISCit0605.html A pilot citation analysis of Australian Information Systems Researchers]", 2006 (note: this self published website article is cited in ''Australasian Journal of Information Systems'', Volume 15, Number 2, 2009 - "Electronic Commerce publications and the implications for research quality output in Australia")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rens Scheepers, Helana Scheepers, Julie Fisher, "[http://journals.sfu.ca/acs/index.php/ajis/article/viewArticle/33?ads= Electronic Commerce publications and research in Australia: Implications of the Research Quality Framework]" ''Australasian Journal of Information Systems'', Volume 15, Number 2, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

Notability may be considered to be [[wikt:absolute|absolute]]ly [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], e.g., inherently as the [[big bang]]; [[relativism|relatively]] objectively determinable using a [[Convention (norm)|convention]]al definition, which is [[subjectivity|subjectively]] determined by [[consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;Paula Berinstein, "[http://infotoday.com/searcher/mar06/berinstein.shtml Wikipedia and Britannica:The Kid’s All Right (And So’s the Old Man)]", ''Information Today''&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., an online encyclopedia consensus to consider all towns as being notable, no matter how small; or [[subjective experience|subjective]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharman Lichtenstein A1 and Craig M. Parker, "[http://inderscience.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,12;journal,5,21;linkingpublicationresults,1:112926,1 Wikipedia model for collective intelligence: a review of information quality]", ''International Journal of Knowledge and Learning'', Volume 5, Number 3-4, 2009, pp. 254-272&lt;/ref&gt; such as a notably emotional day for an individual.

== Using fallacious reasoning to confer notability==
[[Name dropping]] and [[argument by authority]] are examples of attempts to confer notability by associating the name of something notable with something else in an attempt to establish notability of that thing.

Conferring notability is related to [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and the [[syllogism]]. If all A's are notable, and x is an A, then x is notable is true by syllogism, but if A is notable, and x is an element of A, then x is not necessarily notable. If x is more notable than y, and y is more notable than z, then x is more notable than z, but if person x considers A to be notable, and A is a subset of B, then x does not necessarily consider B to be notable; an example of an [[intentional context]] in the [[paradox of the name relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Føllesdal, ''Philosophy of Quine'' (2000) 5 volumes. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3737-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}

'''Oscar Tuazon''' (née Hansen) is an American artist based in Los Angeles who works in sculpture, architecture, and mixed media.

==Early life==
Oscar Tuazon was born Oscar Hansen on July 9, 1975, in a geodesic dome his parents built in the woods at Indianola, [[Kitsap County, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Deep Springs College]], [[Cooper Union]], and the Whitney Independent Study Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/how-do-i-look-oscar-tuazon-artist-35-2008449.html How do I look?: Oscar Tuazon, artist, 35, [[The Independent]], June 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he served as a founding board member at the [[Center for Urban Pedagogy]] in New York with his former Deep Springs classmate [[Damon Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcometocup.org/People Center for Urban Pedagogy: People, Accessed April 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5529/city-without-a-ghetto-center-for-urban-pedagogy "City Without a Ghetto, Center for Urban Pedagogy", Bomb Magazine Spring 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar met and married Lan Tuazon in New York in the mid-90s and changed his name from Oscar Hansen to Oscar Tuazon. The couple would later be divorced, but he kept the last name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; His brother and frequent collaborator, Eli Hansen, is also an artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/When-brothers-Eli-Hansen-and-Oscar-Tuazon-deliver-1271392.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parcsaintleger.fr/en/portfolio/oscar-tuazon-eli-hansen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Professionally, he began his career working in the Studio Acconci of architect/artist [[Vito Acconci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/28/artist-week-oscar-tuazon "Artist of the week 98: Oscar Tuazon," The Guardian, July 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Paris in 2007, he began exhibiting widely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.fr/culture/agenda/articles/rencontre-avec-oscar-tuazon-la-biennale-de-venise-/19265 "Rencontre avec Oscar Tuazon à la Biennale de Venise," Paris Vogue]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since then exhibited at the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[Whitney Biennial]], and many group and solo shows throughout the world, and is in major art collections such as Saatchi's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-first-artists-on-the-waterfront/Content?oid=19141739 " The First Artists on the Waterfront," The Stranger, March 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon 2012 Whitney Biennial Exhibitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418142536/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon |date=2015-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic in the art magazine [[Frieze]] wrote in 2013 that "like his heroes, from [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] to wilderness survivalists, Tuazon’s non-conformist approach to artistic practice plays at the juncture of architecture, sculpture and performance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/oscar-tuazon/ "Oscar Tuazon," Frieze, April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York Times]] review described his work as "haunting ... pit[ting] Mr. Acconci's robust ego against Mr. Tuazon's raw and fragile subjectivity." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/arts/design/16galleries-005.html "Oscar Tuazon: ‘My Flesh to Your Bare Bones’," New York Times, April 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2013, he moved from France to the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood of Los Angeles with his three children and wife Dorothée Perret, a former editor at [[Purple (magazine)|Purple Magazine]] who now helms the art magazine "Paris, LA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmagazine.com/people/2013/11/dorothee-perret/ "Dorothée Perret: Saint Laurent designer Hedi Slimane isn’t the only French expat to put down roots in Los Angeles," W Magazine, November 21, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sightunseen.com/2012/01/oscar-tuazon-artist-and-dorothee-perret-editor-2/ "At Home With Oscar Tuazon, artist, and Dorothée Perret, editor," Sight Unseen, January 25, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Perseus Freeing Andromeda''''' is a painting by the Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], executed in 1622. It is housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin]], Germany.

The painting belonged the M. Pasquier collection in [[Rouen]], which was auctioned in 1755 in Paris. In the 18th century it entered the collection of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and, in 1830, it became part of the Berlinese museum collection.

The scene is similar to another ''Perseus Freeing Andromeda'' by Rubens now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of [[St. Petersburg]]. It depicts the [[Greek mythology]] hero [[Perseus]] in the act of freeing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], after defeating the sea monster which kept her as prisoner. Perseus, wearing helmet, cuirass and cloak, is sided by two puttoes, and one of them  is helping him in removing the ropes that tie Andromeda to the rock.

On the left, two puttoes are playing with [[Pegasus]], Perseus' winged horse.

'''Phiale''' is a term in [[Ancient Greek architecture]] for a building or columned arcade around a fountain, the equivalent of the Roman [[nymphaeum]].  The falling water from the fountain was and usually still is collected in a flattish bowl-shaped bowl, the usual meaning of [[Phiale (libation vessel)|phiale]], as a shape for a vessel in [[Ancient Greek pottery]] or silverware.  

In [[Byzantine architecture]] the phiale was also built in the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of, or just outside, a church or the ''[[katholikon]]'' (main church) of a [[monastery]].  Typically, there is an open arcade of columns supporting a small [[dome]], often [[octagon]]al, as a symbol of the mystery ([[sacrament]]) of [[baptism]] or new life. In addition to allowing visitors to wash and refresh themselves before entering the church, the phiale is used for taking water for [[benediction]]s and in the ceremony of the [[Great Blessing of Waters]] at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}
In [[Programming language|computer programming]], a '''return code''' or an '''error code''' is an enumerated message that corresponds to the status of a specific [[software application]]. They are typically used to identify faults, such as those in faulty [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], or incorrect user input.

==In systems software==

[[Exit status]] is the return code of computer programs running as [[process (computing)|processes]], and is communicated through [[system call]]s.

==In networking software==

[[Network protocol]]s typically support returning status codes. In the [[TCP/IP stack]], it's a common feature of higher level protocols. For example:

* [[List of HTTP status codes]]
* [[List of FTP server return codes]]
* [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#Protocol overview]]

==Error codes and exception handling==
Error codes are used in various methods of solving the [[semipredicate problem]]. They are generally similar to [[exception handling]] in programming languages that support it.

Error codes are slowly disappearing from the programmer's environment as modern [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[programming languages]] replace them with [[Exception handling|exceptions]].{{editorializing|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Exceptions have the advantage of being handled with explicit blocks of code, separate from the rest of the code.  While it is considered poor practice in methodologies that use error codes and return codes to indicate failure, programmers often neglect to check return values for error conditions. That negligence can cause undesirable effects, as ignored error conditions often cause more severe problems later in the program. Exceptions are implemented in such a way as to separate the error handling code from the rest of the code. Separating the error handling code from the normal logic makes programs easier to write and understand, since one block of error handling code can service errors from any number of function calls. Exception handling also makes the code more readable than implementations with error codes, since exception handling does not disrupt the flow of the code with frequent checks for error conditions.

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and psychological functions==
Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Figured Ostracon Showing a Cat Waiting on a Mouse.jpg|thumb|Figured ostracon showing a cat waiting on a mouse, Egypt]]
One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D.

His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J.

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940). Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"/&gt;]]
In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

The film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) starring [[Peter Sellers]] was a popular satire on the [[Cold War]].

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]] from the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'']]
Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norris (2014).

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

The American sketch comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name=TVGuide1&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-amy-poehler/ Liz Raftery – "Who Did the Best Hillary Clinton Impression on SNL?", ''TV Guide'', April 30, 2015.

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]
Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|The Juice Media#Controversy}}
In September 2017 [[The Juice Media]] received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the "Coat of Harms" based on the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]], no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the [[Australian Senate]] with the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] moved 10 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973#|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On December 29, 2009, Samsung sued [[Michael Breen (author)|Mike Breen]], and the ''[[The Korea Times|Korea Times]]'' for $1 million, claiming criminal defamation over a satirical column published on Christmas Day, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100510/1820159367.shtml |title=Samsung Sues Satirist, Claiming Criminal Defamation, Over Satirical Column Poking Fun At Samsung |publisher=Techdirt |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-fg-korea-samsung-20100510,0,7395282,full.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=John M | last=Glionna | date=May 10, 2010 | title=Samsung doesn't find satirical spoof amusing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

==Satirical prophecy==
Satire is occasionally prophetic: the jokes precede actual events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Paul Krassner | first = Paul | last = Krassner | url = http://nypress.com/terminal-velocity-television-is-here/ | title = Terminal velocity television is here | journal = New York Press | volume = 16 | issue = 35 | date = August 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | title = Lepidezze postribolari | year = 2007 | publisher = Feltrinelli | page = 275 | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eminent examples are:
* The 1784 presaging of modern [[daylight saving time]], later actually proposed in 1907. While an American envoy to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]] anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that [[Paris]]ians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.&lt;ref name='Franklin'&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Benjamin Franklin | first = Benjamin | last = Franklin |title=Aux auteurs du Journal|journal=[[Journal de Paris]]|date=April 26, 1784|issue= 117|language = French}}  Wrote [[anonymously]]. Its first publication was in the journal's "Économie" section.  {{Citation | url = http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/franklin3.html | edition = revised English version | accessdate = May 26, 2007 | title = An Economical Project}} has a title that is not Franklin's; see {{cite journal|author=A.O. Aldridge|title=Franklin's essay on daylight saving|journal=American Literature|issue=1|pages=23–29|year=1956| doi = 10.2307/2922719 |publisher=American Literature | volume = 28 |jstor=2922719}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government. (...) satirists criticized government activities, exposed ambiguities, and forced administrators to clarify or establish policies. Not surprisingly, heated public controversy surrounded satiric commentary, resulting in an outright ban on political satire in 1835 (...) Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seal of the City of Los Angeles''' is, since 1905, the official [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], a city located in the southern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is encircled by the legal name of the city (City of Los Angeles) and year founded (1781). It was adopted on March 27, 1905, via Ordinance 10,834.

==Symbolism==
The [[Heraldry|heraldic]] [[blazon]] of the [[coat of arms]], as declared in the 1905 ordinance, is: Inside the ribbon, flanking the escutcheon, are [[grape]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], major crops of California, on their plants. These are also symbolized in the colors of the [[flag of Los Angeles]]. The fruit are on a field [[or (tincture)|or]], bordered with a 77-bead [[rosary]], which presents [[Spanish missions in California]].

The arms are [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterly]]:
* &lt;u&gt;1st quarter&lt;/u&gt;: the [[:Image:Coat of arms of the United States.svg|lesser coat of arms of the United States]]. A field paleways of thirteen pieces [[argent]] and [[gules]]; chief, [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] charged with five rays argent.

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby. The Widow of an Indian Chief Watching the Arms of Her Deceased Husband.1785..jpg|thumb|right|''[[Indian Widow]]'' was exhibited at the first recorded solo exhibition of art in Britain, held by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] during 1785]]
A '''solo show''' or '''solo exhibition''' is an [[art exhibition|exhibition]] of the work of only one artist. The artwork may be paintings, drawings, [[etching]]s, [[collage]], sculpture, or photography. The creator of any artistic technique may be the subject of a solo show. Other skills and crafts have similar types of shows for the creators. Having solo shows of one's artwork marks the achievement of success and usually is accompanied by receptions and a great deal of publicity. The show may be of current work being produced, those from a single time period, or representative work from different periods in the career of the artist, the latter is termed a ''retrospective''. 

==History==
Art exhibitions have [[Art exhibition#History of art exhibitions|a history]] that dates back to 1623. It is thought that the first solo exhibition in Britain was staged by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/featuredartists/josephwrightderby/ Joseph Wright of Derby], Liverpool Museums, accessed March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the year after he refused to become a [[Royal Academy|Royal Academician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/873542 Two companion pieces by Wright of Derby], B. Nicholson, accessed March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Galleries became numerous in large cities during the nineteenth century and flourished during the twentieth century, often becoming included among [[Retailing|stores]] in small towns as well, after the middle of the twentieth century.

Generally, as artists begin to show their work they are accepted by commercial gallery owners for display among the works of many or among others who work in the same area. The works of the artists are sold and the galleries take commissions. As artists gain stature and attract a following who will purchase their works in greater numbers, gallery owners will promote their works in solo shows with a great deal of publicity about the show. The artists with the greatest appeal to a gallery's clients may be invited to be represented by that gallery consistently, developing a constant relationship that even may develop into exclusive rights to offer the sale of the works by those artists.

Once artists become recognized for their skills among critics and collectors through representation at galleries, museum directors and staff members may begin to purchase the works of the artists for [[museum collection]]s. Museums also hold exhibitions that change regularly and may choose to feature a solo show of the works of an artist as one of these exhibitions. Works that are gathered on loan from many other museums or collectors also may be scheduled for exhibition at one museum as a solo show. Planning for the exhibitions is a long process. Museums schedule their exhibitions for a given year well in advance and their negotiations may begin years before the shows are held. 

Some artists create a large number of works that they reserve as a traveling exhibition that generates income for them as they travel around the world for decades as solo shows at museums and galleries. Typically, the contract arrangements for booking such a large exhibition are that the hosting organization pays a fee to the artist, arranges for the safe delivery, set up, and return of the exhibition, and it charges admission to those attracted to the exhibition by extensive publicity generated by the host and approved by the artist. 

The term "one-man show" was used at times to describe these art exhibitions, but has fallen out of favor, even though the term "[[one-man show]]" persists to describe a solo performance among some entertainment venues and [[performing arts]].

'''Tamil cinema in Sri Lanka''' is not as developed as [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] or its Indian counterpart, the [[Tamil cinema]] of [[Kodambakkam]], [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. This is especially due to the high production rates of the influential commercial Tamil films from [[Tamil Nadu]], India and the long run [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic civil war in Sri Lanka]]. Tamils contributed significantly to [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] as well as Indian [[Tamil cinema]], also known as ''Kollywood''. Only a few [[Tamil language]] films were produced in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Earlier Tamil movies produced were all most destroyed or unrecovered due to civil war.

==Producers and directors==
* [[S. M. Nayagam]], a Sri-Lankan Tamil of Indian origin, was the first producer of a Sinhala film ''[[Kadawunu Poronduwa]]'' (roughly translated as "Broken Promise"), which was produced in 1947. Since production and technical facilities were unavailable in Sri Lanka at the time all production work was completed in Madurai, South India. He went on to produce many other Sinhala films &amp;mdash; ''Mathalang'', ''Ahankara Istree'' &amp;mdash; and was the pioneer of Sinhala cinema.
* K. Gunaratnam was one of the most successful producers of early Sri Lankan cinema.&lt;ref name="Gunara"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ranat|title=Good Start for Cinema|work=Sunday Times |year=2000 |accessdate=15 April 2009|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/000227/plus3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the popular and influential ''[[Sujatha (1953 film)|Sujatha]]'' Gunaratnam brought his Cinemas Ltd. company into original productions in 1953. Previously he had dubbed several Indian films into Sinhala. Over the span of the decade, Gunaratnam had hit after hit with such works as ''Warada Kageda?'', ''Radala Piliruwa'' and ''Saradam''. In the 1960s, he produced some sophisticated art films like ''Sandeshaya'' and ''Deewarayo'' which broke away from imitation of Indian cinema.
* M. S. Anandan gained accolades with his camera work for Sri Lankan films like ''Golu Hadawatha'' and ''Nidhanaya''. As a director he produced sophisticated commercial movies that were hugely popular in their time.
* T. Somesekeran directed and produced the Sinhala movie ''[[Seda Sulang]]'', one of the most popular Sri Lankan films of the 1950s. It helped secure the star status of Sinhala actors Prem Jayanth and Florida Jayalath.
* [[Robin Tampoe]] was one of the most prolific early Sri Lankan directors, handling the reins on such works as ''Sudo Sudu'' (1965). He worked in genres including village folk drama, comedy and romance. Tampoe produced all of his films and had his own studio, R. T.
* W. M. S. Tampoe directed several films including the popular 1963 ''Samiya Birindage Deviya''. He is the father of Robin Tampoe.
* K. Venkat directed several Sinhala films in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Thangarajah Arjuna was a graduate of the London School of Film Technique and a presidential award winning filmmaker in Sri Lanka. His film ''Wasanthaye Davask'' still holds the record for the maximum number of presidential awards given for a single feature film.
* D.M Das (Mariyadasan) directed Sinhala films in the 1960s and 1970s."Amathaka Wnada?" (1967),"Hari Maga" (1969),"Ran Wan Rekha" (1975), "Honda Hitha" (1977), "Rangaa" (1981).
* M.Rameshwaram produced 'Sorungeth Soru" (1967), "Thevatha" (1970), "Aparadhaya Saha Danduwama" (1973).
* M.V.Balan also an actor (Comedy) images as Srilankan Nagesh who directed "Oba Nethi Nam" (1969),"Mage Ran Putha" (1978),"Rahasak Nethi Rahasak" (1982).
*J.Selvaratnam,J.Rasaratnam, V.Sivadasan,S.Thevendran, E.Rutnam, S.V.Chandran and several others directed films.

==Music directors and singers==

* [[M. K. Rocksamy]] (1932–1988) was a prolific [[Sri Lanka]]n musician and music director. He became involved in film work after coming in contact with [[R. Muttusamy]] (1928-1988) of the Sundera Murugan Studio in Kandana. Rocksamy was asked to contribute to the soundtrack of several films made at the studio beginning with ''Bandara Nagarayata Pemineema'' (1952). In 1962, he got the opportunity to play a bigger role directing three songs for Shanthi Kumar's ''Sansare'' after its original music director B. S. Perera died.
* A. E. Manoharan (1944-2018) is a Jaffna Tamil baila singer highly popular in Sri Lanka during the 1970s. A star of many Sri Lankan Tamil films, his only appearance in Sinhala cinema was in Titus Thotawatte's ''Maruwa Samage Wase'' in a baila medley scene that included his hit "Suranganee".

==Actors and actresses==

* [[Rukmani Devi]] was the first star of Sri Lankan cinema with her performance in the 1947 ''[[Kadawunu Poronduwa]]''. Through the 1950s and 1960s, she remained highly popular, starring in many successful films. She is the only Sri Lankan actress to sing her own songs. She is of [[Colombo Chetty]] origin.
* [[Shayama Ananda|Shyama Anandan]] was the star of several of her father M. S. Anandan's productions (i.e. ''Chandi Shyama'') that highlighted the exploits of her rebellious teenager character. She also had a supporting role in the art film ''[[Gehenu Lamai]]'' which gained her critical praise.
* Asoka Ponnamperuma was a hefty actor who starred in several films during the 1960s. He directed a film later.
* [[Darshan Dharmaraj]] is one of the most popular and influential modern day tamil actors work in Sinhala cinema. He was awarded several times for Best Actor in films like [[Matha (film)|Matha]] and [[Ini Avan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Hiru golden film awards which took srilankan cinema to global stage concludes successfully massive response from public|url=http://www.hirunews.lk/95557/hiru-golden-film-awards-which-took-sri-lankan-cinema-to-global-stage-concludes-successfully-massive-response-from-public-video|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=Hiru News|date=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Bernstein]]'s '''Symphony No. 2 ''The Age of Anxiety''''' is a piece for [[orchestra]] and solo [[piano]]. The piece was composed from 1948 to 1949 in the [[United States|US]] and [[Israel]], and was revised in 1965. It is titled after [[W. H. Auden]]'s [[The Age of Anxiety (poem)|poem of the same name]], and dedicated to [[Serge Koussevitzky]].

==History==
A friend is claimed to have given Bernstein the idea to write music based on ''The Age of Anxiety'' in a letter:
::What do you think of the 'Anxiety' idea? There is so much musical-subtlety in it, and those various metres brought about by the different roads the couples take and their differing means of transportation, to say nothing of the moods, and the separateness that becomes Oneness under alcohol and/or libidinal urges. You mentioned it being good ballet material, yes, but I think, first, it should be composed as music by itself and therefore protect it from being too obvious program music, and then if some clever choreographer can put the musical composition to work, with what added quality good music may give to the themes and material, well and good. I would rather have 'it' in the concert hall, where it can be less 'handled' than in the ballet school where many different talents brush it up. It's too good a thing for many hands.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.leonardbernstein.com/works_anxiety.htm Leonard Bernstein.com] &lt;/ref&gt;

When beginning to write the piece, Bernstein stated that Auden's poem was "one of the most shattering examples of pure virtuosity in the history of English poetry" and that a "composition of a symphony based on The Age of Anxiety acquired an almost compulsive quality."&lt;ref&gt; Chisolm &lt;/ref&gt; Having won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1948, "The Age of Anxiety" Bernstein lauded the piece, saying "When I first read the book I was breathless." Bernstein worked on the composition "in Taos, Philadelphia, Richmond, Mass., in Tel-Aviv, in planes, in hotel lobbies..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/symphony-no-2-age-of-anxiety-leonard-bernstein LA Phil]&lt;/ref&gt; Though titled as such, “The Age of Anxiety” bucks the traditional form of a symphony. Instead of a conventional four-movement, exclusively orchestral work, Bernstein scored it for solo piano and orchestra, and divided the piece into six subsections – mirroring Auden’s text – split equally into two parts that are performed without pause.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the piece on March 20, 1949 in New York City. Unsatisfied with the ending of the composition, Bernstein revised it in 1965 to firmly establish his idea for the true ending.  The work was dedicated to and commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky who was preparing to end his 25-year career conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

==Instrumentation and structure==
The symphony is composed for an orchestra containing 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, 2 harps, celesta, pianino (upright piano), strings, and solo piano.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/symphony-no-2-age-of-anxiety-leonard-bernstein&lt;/ref&gt;

Structurally, there are two parts, each comprising three sections. Each movement is named after the six sections of Auden's poem, trying to mirror the moods and events in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardbernstein.com/works_anxiety.htm Chisholm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part One===
* a) The Prologue: Lento moderato
* b) The Seven Ages: Variations 1 – 7
*# Variation 1 L'istesso tempo
*# Variation 2 Poco più mosso
*# Variation 3 Largamente, ma mosso
*# Variation 4 Più mosso
*# Variation 5 Agitato
*# Variation 6 Poco meno mosso
*# Variation 7 L'istesso tempo
* c) The Seven Stages: Variations 8 – 14
*# Variation 8 Molto moderato, ma movendo
*# Variation 9 Più mosso (Tempo di Valse)
*# Variation 10 Più mosso
*# Variation 11 L'istesso tempo
*# Variation 12 Poco più vivace
*# Variation 13 L'istesso tempo
*# Variation 14 Poco più vivace

In accordance with Auden’s “Prologue,” the poem begins with four lonely individuals (three men and one woman) in a bar, each reflecting on his or her own disquietude while acknowledging the presence of the others. Musically, a plaintive clarinet duet signals the beginning of the characters’ journey, with a long descending scale signaling their retreat to a shared unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt;  It is here that the characters begin discussing life in each of their own points of view, moving onto “The Seven Ages.”  Here, Bernstein composed a set of variations that are unique in the fact that, rather than all sharing the same melody or thematic material like a traditional theme and variations would, each variation plays on the material from the variation immediately before it.  This gives the work a constantly shifting landscape that is reminiscent of the past but progressing for the future.  It then proceeds to “The Seven Stages,” that tells the tale of the same “group [embarking] on a collective dream, one of even more heightened awareness, attempting to rediscover the deeper meaning of their own humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt;  Emulating the characters conflicting ideals and desires, Bernstein weaves a frantic and confused musical tapestry that shows the characters trying desperately to find what they are searching for, but falling short, though becoming closer because of their experience.  This brings the first half of the piece to a dramatic and abrupt close.

===Part Two===
* a) The Dirge: Largo
* b) The Masque: Extremely Fast
* c) The Epilogue: Adagio; Andante; Con moto

The second half of the piece opens with “The Dirge”, a theme, first introduced by the solo piano, based on a 12-tone row that gives way to a contrasting middle section, reminiscent of Brahms’ romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, the four travel to the women’s apartment by cab, mourning the loss of their fallen father ("Dad") figure.  Once they arrive at the apartment, the four are determined to have a party, but refuse to take the attention away from any of the others, and all opt to turn in for the night.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt;  “The Masque” is a speedy piano solo that is accompanied by syncopated rhythms in various percussion instruments.  The main theme is the tune from Ain't Got No Tears Left, a song cut from [[On the Town (musical)|On The Town]].  The piano is joined by the rest of the orchestra for a time before it drops out entirely, becoming “traumatized” as it tries to come to terms with its “escapist living.”&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm&lt;/ref&gt;  The energy from “The Masque” fades and the entire orchestra comes in to repeat the bars it had been playing before, now joined by the strings and starting “The Epilogue.” Here, echoes of the “Prologue” resound while the new 4 note theme is contemplated by the reminiscent piano soloist.  Answering the orchestra’s calls for clarity, a solo piano cadenza, added in 1965, revisits the journey of the characters, and is taken up by the full orchestra, which builds to a radiant close. The listener, as well as the reader, finds that “what is left, it turns out, is faith.”&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premiere==
The work was premiered on April 8, 1949, with [[Serge Koussevitzky]] conducting the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and the composer at the piano. It was met with good reviews and received a repeat performance in Tanglewood that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded for the first time by Columbia Records in 1950 with Bernstein himself conducting the New York Philharmonic with pianist Lukas Foss as the soloist. A typical performance of the work lasts approximately 35 to 40 minutes.

W.H. Auden, who reportedly did not care for ballet and thought it a "very, very minor art", appears not to have appreciated the translation of his poem into other media. After the Symphony's premiere he commented that it "really has nothing to do with me. Any connections with my book are rather distant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| accessdate = March 24, 2018 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVh_BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp; | pages=136–7 | title = A Companion to American Literary Studies | publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons | author =Catherine Gunther Kodat | chapter = Performance Anxieties: The A-Literary Companions of American Literary Studies |date =2015 | editor-first1= Caroline F. |editor-last1= Levander |editor-first2= Robert S. |editor-last2= Levine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Angelus''''' (''L'Angélus'') is an [[oil painting]] by French painter [[Jean-François Millet]], completed between 1857 and 1859.

The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the [[Angelus]], that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work.&lt;ref name="Gamb"/&gt;

Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector [[Thomas Gold Appleton]], who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the [[Barbizon school]] up to record amounts in the late 19th century.

==History==
Millet said: "The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed".&lt;ref name=musee&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=339 ''L'Angelus'', Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt; Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, ''Prayer for the Potato Crop'', to ''The Angelus''.

It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in [[Barbizon]], with a view of the church tower of [[Chailly-en-Bière]]. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as "a young peasant and his companion". Millet sold ''The Angelus'' after his ''[[The Gleaners]]'' was sold at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount he sold ''The Gleaners'' for. ''The Angelus'' was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in [[Brussels]] in 1874, where it was greatly admired by [[Léon Gambetta]].&lt;ref name="Gamb"&gt;Foley, Susan.  [http://www.h-france.net/rude/rudevoliv/FoleyVol4.pdf "A Great and Noble Painting": Léon Gambetta and the Visual Arts in the French Third Republic] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, [[Salvador Dalí]] saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/angelus-work Schneider, Nathan. "The Angelus at Work", ''America'', March 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial – perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting ''A Burial at Ornans'' (1850) – but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower.

==Commentary==
At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers.
While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, "There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in."&lt;ref name=Huguenaud&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/the-angelus/ Huguenaud, Karine. ''The Angelus'', April 2010, Napoleon.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Praët exchanged it for Millet’s ''Bergère avec son troupeau'' (Shepherd and his flock) and commented dryly, “What can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome”.&lt;ref name=Huguenaud/&gt; 

==Provenance==
The painting triggered a rush of patriotic fervour when the Louvre tried to buy it in 1889, and  was vandalized by a madman in 1932.&lt;ref name=musee/&gt; 
 
With reference to the [[Musée d'Orsay]], the provenance of the work is as follows; although (until updated) some events are missing, such as the Brussels show in 1874:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000345&amp;cHash=e2e2221b05 record for nr.

==Legacy==
A month after the Secretan sale, ''The Gleaners'' was sold for 300,000 francs, and the contrast between the auction prices of Millet's paintings on the art market and the value of Millet's estate for his surviving family led to the ''[[droit de suite]]'' ([[French language|French]] for "right to follow"), a French law that compensates artists or their heirs when artworks are resold. 

The imagery of ''The Angelus'' with peasants praying was a popular sentimental 19th-century religious subject.  Generations later, [[Salvador Dalí]] had seen a reproduction of it on the wall of his childhood school and claimed to have been spooked by the painting. He felt the basket looked like the coffin of a child and the woman looked like a [[praying mantis]]. He was inspired to create his [[Paranoiac-critical method|paranoiac-critical]] paintings ''The Architectural Angelus of Millet'' and ''[[Gala Dalí|Gala]] and the Angelus of Millet Preceding the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses'' in 1933. These were followed two years later by a similar pair of paintings which included a partial reproduction of Millet's ''The Angelus'', called ''The Angelus of Gala'' and ''Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus''. In 1938, he published a book ''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet''.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet'', by Jean-Jacques Pauvert with plates by Salvador Dalí, 1963, {{ISBN|2844854184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[Mythical theology]] for the theological concept.''
'''''Theologia mythologica''''' is a 1532 book by [[Georg Pictorius]]. It was one of the first treatises of [[Classical mythology]] in the [[German Renaissance]]. Pictorius interprets the Greek pantheon as [[allegory]], e.g. [[Cybele]] as the [[Earth]], her chariot wheels as symbolizing the rotation of the Earth.

The '''Twentieth Century Society''' ('''C20''') is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] which campaigns for the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of [[architectural]] heritage from 1914 onwards.&lt;ref name="C20about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society's interests embrace buildings and artefacts that characterise 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; It is formally recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[listed building]]s within its period of interest, and must be notified of any proposed work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was formed as The Thirties Society in 1979, the year in which the prominent "Thirties – British art and design before the War" exhibition was shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]].&lt;ref name=c20history&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gavin |last1=Stamp |authorlink1=Gavin Stamp |first2=Alan |last2=Powers |authorlink2=Alan Powers |title=A Brief History |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was inspired by and loosely modelled on the [[Victorian Society]], which aims to protect pre-1914 Victorian and Edwardian buildings. [[Bevis Hillier]] was the first president, and [[Clive Aslet]] the first honorary secretary.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; In 1992, the society changed its name to The Twentieth Century Society, as it was felt that "Thirties Society" failed to indicate its interest in the protection of buildings from other periods as well.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;

*The catalyst for establishing the society in 1979 was the proposal to replace Sir [[Edwin Cooper (architect)|Edwin Cooper]]'s classical 1928 building for [[Lloyds of London]] with a new building by [[Richard Rogers]]. The society's protests were too late, and Rogers' [[Lloyd's building]] was completed in 1986 (and was itself [[listed building|listed]] Grade I in 2011).&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*The society's first serious high-profile case was that of the [[Art Deco]] [[Firestone tyre factory]] of 1928 on the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Great West Road]] in West London. The building was demolished by its owners over a [[bank holiday]] weekend in August 1980 in anticipation of its being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1985–6 the society campaigned against the wholesale replacement of the traditional K-series [[red telephone box]]es designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] between 1926 and 1936. The campaign attracted much public support, and led to a number of boxes being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1987, the society successfully campaigned for the listing of [[Bracken House, London]], the former home of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', designed by Sir [[Albert Richardson]] and built between 1955 and 1958. This was the first post-[[Second World War]] building to be listed, the previous cut-off date having been 1939.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; 
*In 1993–4, the society successfully persuaded the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] to take into care and open to the public [[2 Willow Road]], [[Hampstead]], completed in 1939, and designed by the Hungarian architect [[Ernő Goldfinger]] for his own occupation.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; 
* In the 1980s and 1990s the society campaigned repeatedly for the preservation and listing of [[Bankside Power Station]], designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], constructed in two phases in 1947–52 and 1958–63, and decommissioned in 1981. The campaign was ultimately successful, and the building reopened as the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2000.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt;

The '''Vancouver Asian Film Festival''' (VAFF) is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] for about 4–5 days in November.  Launching in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2006/11/01/vancouver-asian-festival.html?ref=rss CBC covers VAFF's 10th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt; it is Canada’s oldest Asian film festival, exhibiting films and videos by North American artists of Asian heritage. It was founded in 1995 and debuted in September 1997. Since then, tens of thousands of film lovers have experienced a diverse selection of North American-Asian and international films.

Each year VAFF attracts close to 4,000 audience members over its four-day festival and year-round events. It also reaches many more through word of mouth, pre-festival events, and traditional and social media throughout the year.

Awards include a juried award for Best Canadian Short. Categories include: Narrative (i.e. drama, comedy, romance), Documentary, Animation, and Experimental.  Visiting artists have included [[Ham Tran]], [[Justin Lin]], [[Michael Kang (director)|Michael Kang]] and [[Jessica Yu]], as well as BC filmmakers, [[Mina Shum]] and [[Julia Kwan]].  The festival has been host to major stars such as [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-169830/ping-pong-park-grace-vaff Straight.com covers Grace Park at VAFF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaff.org/news-archives/closing-night-at-vaff-with-grace-park Grace Park at VAFF]&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

VAFF is a not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/festival/Vancouver_Asian_Film_Festival/ Film Festival World]&lt;/ref&gt; VAFF is entirely organized and produced by a group of dedicated volunteers, and is made possible by generous financial support from corporate sponsors, public funders and private donors.

==Mission==
VAFF strives to promote dynamic and innovative images of Asians, especially Canadian Asians, in a typical roles usually not found in mainstream film and television with the belief that in order to have these images, the creative control and storytelling must come from the Asian Canadian communities themselves and the support must begin with these independent Asian filmmakers. Therefore, this festival was created to showcase their works to both Asian and non-Asian audiences. This festival aims to include all Canadian communities and to develop open and appreciative communications between all communities in Vancouver.

The '''Weinberg Center''' is a venue located in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. It holds various showings of music, theatre, films and visual art.  The theatre was built as the Tivoli Theatre by the Stanley-Crandall concern and opened on December 23, 1926.  It was the premiere movie theatre of Frederick for nearly fifty years but, after considerable damage suffered in a 1976 flood, closed.  The Weinberg family, which then owned the old movie palace, chose to present it to the city as a gift rather than attempt to keep it open as a movie house.  The theatre has been maintained in the splendid style of 1926.  The theatre's organ, a two-manual, eight-rank [[Wurlitzer]], is the only original [[theatre organ]] installation in the state.   The Weinberg Center holds several dozen events every year, and has an annual budget of over one million dollars.
