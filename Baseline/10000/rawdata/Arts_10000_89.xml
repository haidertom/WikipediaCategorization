{{French art history}}
'''19th-century French art''' was made in France or by French citizens during the following political regimes: [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[First Consul|Consulate]] (1799-1804) and [[First French Empire|Empire]] (1804-1814), the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (1814-1830), the [[July Monarchy]] under [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe d'Orléans]] (1830-1848), the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848-1852), the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]] (1852-1871), and the first decades of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871-1940).

Many of the developments in French arts in this period parallel changes in literature.  For more on this, see [[French literature of the 19th century]].

For more on French history, see [[History of France]].

==Romanticism==
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France.  The program of exaltation and mythification of the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of Gros and Guérin.

Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]] and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, all these elements of [[Romanticism]] created a vibrant period that defies classicism.

[[Image:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[The Massacre at Chios]] - Eugène Delacroix]]

One also finds in the early period of the 19th century a repeat of the debate carried on in the 17th between the supporters of Rubens and Poussin: there are defenders of the "line" as found in [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and the violent colors and curves as found in [[Eugène Delacroix]].  The comparison is however somewhat false, for Ingres' intense realism sometimes gives way to amazing voluptuousness in his Turkish bath scenes.

Romanticism is a literary language based on feelings.  Writers who illustrated this concept included [[John Keats]] and [[Benjamin Constant]].  The Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century: both idealized landscape painting and [[Naturalism (visual art)|Naturalism]]  have their seeds in Romanticism: both [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments, as is too the late 19th century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters at [[Gustave Moreau]] (the professor of Matisse and Rouault) or [[Odilon Redon]]. [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Camille Claudel]] are the most famous sculptors of their time.

==Birth of the Modern==
[[Walter Benjamin]] called Paris "the capital of the 19th century".  In order to  understand the amazing diversity of artistic expressions which Paris gave birth to from the 1860s to all nightboulevards, but also replaced poorer neighborhoods and created fast routes to move troops through the city to quell unrest.  Yet there was also a second Paris at the limits of Haussmann's city on the hill of [[Montmartre]] with her windmills, cabarets and vineyards.  Café culture, cabarets, arcades (19th century covered malls), [[anarchism]], the mixing of classes, the radicalization of art and artistic movements caused by the academic [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] system, a boisterous willingness to shock &amp;mdash; all this made for a stunning vibrancy.  What is more, the dynamic debate in the visual arts is also repeated in the same period in music, dance, architecture and the novel: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Proust, Nijinski, etc.  This is the birth of [[Modernism]].

[[Édouard Manet]] represents for many critics the division between the 19th century and the modern period (much like [[Charles Baudelaire]] in poetry).  His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude and his radical brush strokes are the first step toward Impressionism.

[[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one further, rejecting once and for all a belabored style (and the use of mixed colors and black), for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (in part inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]).  [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers.

Some of these techniques were made possible by new paints available in tubes.  These painters were also to a certain degree in a dialogue with another discovery of the 19th century: photography.

From this point on, the next thirty years were a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born but living in France, opened the road to expressionism.  [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a pointillist technique that controlled the Impressionist experiment. [[Paul Cézanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world (that left many of his peers indifferent). [[Paul Gauguin]], the banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbler, becomes the model for the naïve revolution.

The [[Little Red Riding Hood]] [[fairy tale]] has often been '''adapted''', and into a wide variety of media.

==Comics==
[[File:zenescope1.jpg|thumb|Little Red Riding Hood in one of a number of comic book adaptations. Art by [[Al Rio]], published by Zenescope.]]
*In the Tales of [[Asgard]] section of [[Marvel Comics]]' series ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (1965 March), a story which at the end claims to be the basis of Little Red Riding Hood appears. The goddess [[Iðunn|Iduna]] walks the forests of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] carrying a bundle of golden apples. These "Golden Apples of Immortality" are for All-Father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and Iduna brings them to him every year. Along her journey she meets Haakun the Hunter. Haakun greets her warmly and tells her to go in peace. As Iðunn continues further down the path, wearing her crimson cloak and hood, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]] the Wolf-God sees her and transforms himself. Iduna next comes upon "a frail stranger". The stranger offers Iduna protection along her journey, but she declines the offer. The stranger takes a strong interest in Iduna's basket and begins asking her questions. She quickly grows suspicious, saying his hands seem so grasping -so brutal, and he has an odd voice, like the guttural snarl of a wild beast. She finds his manner sinister-frightening, and says his eyes burn with hatred-with pure savagery. She then discovers that the stranger is actually Fenris the Wolf God in disguise. Fenris shape shifts into his true form and attacks her. Haakun the Hunter arrives and drives Fenris away with his enchanted battle ax, causing the Wolf to shrink in an attempt to escape. The ax pursues Fenris and finally strikes him, spiriting him off to the shadowy land of Varinheim.
* [[Neil Gaiman]] worked a darker, more erotic, pre-Perrault version of the Red Riding Hood tale in ''[[The Sandman: The Doll's House|The Doll's House]]'' arc of ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'' comics (1995). In this version, the wolf kills the old lady, tricks the girl into eating her grandmother's meat and drinking her blood, orders the girl to undress and lie in bed with him, and finally devours her. According to Gaiman, his portrayal of the tale was based on the one reported in Robert Darnton's book ''The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2001_11_01_archive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320210843/http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2001_11_01_archive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 20, 2006|website=NeilGaiman.com|title=Archive|date=November 1, 2001|author=Gaiman, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood are characters in the ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]'' [[comic book]] universe (2002–present). The Big Bad Wolf has taken on human form and become known as [[Bigby Wolf]]. He is the sheriff of [[Fabletown]] when the series begins. The figure of Red Riding Hood ("Ride") appears three times. The first two instances are actually spies working for the Fables' enemy The Adversary, magically disguising themselves as Little Red Riding Hood (the second of which is actually the witch [[Baba Yaga]]). The third Red Riding Hood seems to be the genuine article.
* In [[Kaori Yuki]]'s manga ''[[Ludwig Kakumei]]''  (2004-2007), Red Riding Hood is an infamous assassin whose first victims are her parents, after she is tricked by the Prince.
* The character "Red", in the [[webcomic]] ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (webcomic)|No Rest for the Wicked]]'' (2004–present), lives alone in the woods and always carries an axe with her. After being attacked by a wolf (which she has presumably killed and eaten), she has  systematically killed many other wolves in the forest.
* [[Benkyo Tamaoki]] created a twisted and dark version of Red Riding Hood in the manga ''[[Tokyo Red Hood]]'' (2003-2004). It is about a demonic girl dressed as Red Riding Hood who wanted to be devoured by a creature only known as ''Mr. Wolf''.
* [[Palmeros]]' one-shot manga, ''[[Little Red Riding Hood and the Kind Wolf]]'', is a dialogue-less tragedy based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood, portraying the title character as a young girl who befriends a wolf, only for a grim series of events to unfold when she is revealed to have been abused.
* A comic created by Hector Sevilla and Mike S. Miller called ''Lullaby'' features a Red Riding Hood character who is half girl and half wolf (because she got bitten by The Big Bad Wolf). The art can be viewed at [[DeviantArt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Deviant Art|url=http://www.elsevilla.deviantart.com/ |title=elsevilla.deviantart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood in Zenescope's [[Grimm Fairy Tales (comic series)|''Grimm Fairy Tales'' comic series]] depicts Red Riding Hood as a teenage girl nicknamed Red who is going off to bring food to her sick grandmother, who lives deep in the woods. Red gets attacked by a werewolf that kills her grandmother and attacks Red. Red is saved by the woodsman, named Samson, and the wolf turns out be a former lover. This story was a teenager's dream sequence after she gets into a fight with her boyfriend, who wanted to have sex with her.
* The [[manga]] ''[[One Piece]]'' references Red Riding Hood in chapter 413: "The Hunter". One of the protagonists, [[Usopp|Sogeking]], wears a red cloak and is almost killed by a "wolfman", Jyabura. He is saved by Sanji, "the hunter". Later on, Jyabura, attempting to bluff his way out of a fight, depicts [[Nico Robin]] (in a red hood) as his sister.
* Streetfables published a modern, urban adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood called ''Red''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetfables.com:80/red/ |website=Streetfables |title=Red |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313132656/http://www.streetfables.com/red/ |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issue #1 of the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales#Spider-Man Fairy Tales|Spider-Man Fairy Tales]]'' (2007) is an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, with [[Mary Jane Watson]] as the protagonist.
* In Shaun Healey's [[webcomic]] ''EverAfter'', Little Red Riding Hood is depicted as having gone insane inside the Big Bad Wolf's belly, and emerged a violent [[sociopath]] who chopped up the woodsman with his own saw, and needed to be placed in the EverAfter Maximum Security Asylum, along with other twisted fairy tale characters ranging from [[Tom Thumb]] to [[Goldilocks]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Miss Muffet]], etc., all under the care of President [[Humpty Dumpty]] and Dr. Crooked (from a nursery rhyme).
* [[Serena Valentino]] and [[Foo Swee Chin]] wrote and illustrated an adaptation of Red Riding Hood in ''[[Nightmares &amp; Fairy Tales]]'' #8, wherein Red is known as Luna. This comic version focuses on Luna's struggle to cope with her fellow villagers' intense disdain for wolves. When a supposedly "dead" wolf kills her father, Luna sympathizes with the animal more than her parent, causing her mother to throw her out of the house in a fit of rage. Luna befriends a kind young man on the way to her grandmother's house and eventually discovers that her grandmother is a werewolf. When Luna's mother arrives and kills Luna's wolf-grandmother, Luna begins to change into a white wolf but is spared a gruesome death when her friend, in wolf-form, rescues her.
* The origin of [[Batman]]'s famous foe, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], is often shown to involve him dressing up as a character the Red Hood, which criminals hoped to use to make him seem like the mastermind of a robbery.

==Film==
* In the early 1960s, María Gracia starred as Little Red Riding Hood in a trilogy of [[Mexico|Mexican]] films by director Roberto Rodriguez, which were then re-dubbed in English and released in the [[United States]] courtesy of [[K. Gordon Murray]]: the so-called "King of the Kiddie Matinee". These films were: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053693/ ''La Caperucita roja''] (''Little Red Riding Hood'', [[1960 in film|1960]]), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055825/ ''Caperucita y sus tres amigos''] (''Little Red Riding Hood and Her Friends''/''Little Red Riding Hood and Her Three Friends '', [[1961 in film|1961]]) and ''[[Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood|Caperucita y Pulgarcito contra los monstruos]]'' (''Little Red Riding Hood and the Monsters'', [[1962 in film|1962]]). The latter of these films also starred Cesáreo Quezadas, who reprised his recurring role of ''Pulgarcito'' ([[Tom Thumb]]).
* In a 1960 [[Popeye]] film called ''Little Olive Riding Hood'', [[Olive Oyl|Olive]] is using a red hood and delivering hamburgers to her sick friend, [[Wimpy (Popeye)|Wimpy]]. The [[Sea Hag]] wants those hamburgers for herself.
* [[Liza Minnelli]] starred in the television film ''The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood'' (1965), with [[Cyril Ritchard]] as the Wolf and [[Vic Damone]] as the huntsman. This [[Fictional revisionism|revisionist fairy tale]] is told from the Wolf's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0281766|The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood (1965 TV movie)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Soviet film studio [[Belarusfilm]] (1977) made the film ''[[Pro Krasnuyu Shapochku]]'' (''About Red Hat'' ({{lang-ru|Про Красную Шапочку}}) ([[:ru:Про Красную Шапочку (фильм)|in Russian]]).
* Artist [[Red Grooms]] made a 16-minute farcical film version in 1978 starring his daughter Saskia. In 2014 it was combined with a 1984 immersive sculptural work, ''The Alley'', into an exhibition titled ''Beware a Wolf in the Alley''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/arts/design/red-grooms-beware-a-wolf-in-the-alley.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://marlboroughchelsea.com/broome-st/exhibitions/red-grooms-beware-a-wolf-in-the-alley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Filmmaker [[Neil Jordan|Neil Jordan's]] [[horror film|horror]]/[[fantasy film]] ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]), based on the eponymous short story by [[Angela Carter]], told an interweaving series of folkloric tales loosely based on Red Riding Hood that fully exploited its subtexts of [[lycanthropy]], violence and sexual awakening.
* In the [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] live-action film ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (1987; aka ''Akai Megane''), the featured "young lady" (as mentioned in the French and German versions of the tale), an allegory for Fate, is dressed like the Little Red Riding Hood. An anime version of this character appeared later in the film's sequel, ''Jin-Roh''.
* ''[[Red Riding Hood (1989 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' (1989), starring [[Isabella Rossellini]] and [[Craig T. Nelson]], is an American/Israeli musical film directed by [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]].
* [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s television film adaption, ''The Trial of Red Riding Hood'' (1992), starring figure skater [[Elizabeth Manley]], premiered on the [[Disney Channel]] in 1994.
* ''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), starring [[Kiefer Sutherland]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]], adapts the story&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629104317/http://www.salon.com/nov96/freeway961111.html Salon review of film]&lt;/ref&gt; into a modern setting in which the major characters become a psychotic but charming serial killer (named Bob Wolverton) and a sexually abused teenage girl.
* [[Christina Ricci]] starred in ''[[Little Red Riding Hood (1997 film)|Little Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[1997 in film|1997]]), a [[short film]] based on the subject matter.
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] short film ''[[Black XXX-Mas]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]) translates the story to a nightmarish, futuristic urban setting. "The Forest" is the nickname for the jungle-like city, and "Wolfy" is a crooked police officer who hounds this film's Little Red.
* The Kenneth Liu short film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317473/ ''Falsehood'' ([[2001 in film|2001]])] refigures the Little Red Riding Hood story as a legal drama, with the [[Big Bad Wolf]] on trial and [[Little Bo Peep]] as his attorney. Scenes between Peep and the Wolf pay homage to the [[Clarice Starling]]/[[Hannibal Lecter]] scenes in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).
* The [[horror film]] ''[[Red Riding Hood (2003 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), directed by [[Giacomo Cimini]], was a darker take on the classic story.
* [[Cinema of Singapore|Singapore]] cult director [[Tzang Merwyn Tong]] directed the 45-minute short film ''[[A Wicked Tale]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).
* ''[[Hoodwinked]]'' (2005) is an American [[computer-animated]] [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] that retells the folktale ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' as a police investigation, using flashbacks to show multiple characters' points of view.
* The film ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'' (2005), in which a young girl ensnares and tortures a suspected paedophile, was not originally intended to be a ''Red Riding Hood'' homage; however, the film's star, [[Ellen Page]], incidentally chose a red [[hoodie]] to wear in the final scenes, giving them an unintended metaphoric subtext that was later exploited in advertising for the film.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Hard Candy'', Hard Candy DVD&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;!--Can people please refrain from writing about this particular film in a way akin to advertising it. This is meant to be a brief synopsis that leads into the main article--&gt;''[[Red Riding Hood (2006 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) is a [[musical film]] adaptation directed by [[Randal Kleiser]] and test-released in late 2004. The [[experimental film|experimental]] virtual reality features were then enhanced for over an additional year. The film stars [[Morgan Thompson]] as "Red"; also among the actors are [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ashley Rose Orr]], [[Andrea Bowen]], and music opera entertainers well known on Broadway: [[Lainie Kazan]], [[Debi Mazar]], and [[Joey Fatone]].
* The [[short film]] ''Big Bad Wolves'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0874259|Big Bad Wolves (2006 short)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rajneel Singh takes a [[black comedy|black-comedy]]-meets-[[fantasy]] approach by having the story told from the point of view of [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino-style]] [[gangsters]] who try to convince each other that it is actually a [[fable]] about [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. This version features a more classic, [[fairy tale]] approach to the narrative and visuals, but also utilizes a [[werewolf]] as a literal [[sexual predator]].
*The [[horror anthology]] film ''[[Trick r Treat]]'' (2007) contains one story thread inspired by the tale. A girl, played by [[Anna Paquin]], dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood for a Halloween party, but is waylaid by a serial killer in the woods. However, the story twists when she reveals herself to be a werewolf seeking her "first time".
*The 2007 family film [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]] depicts Red Riding Hood as the villain of the story who 'tells it a little bit differently' when relating the events of the fairy tale. Princess Giselle claims that her chipmunk sidekick stopped Red from hacking the innocent wolf to death with an axe.

After her grandmother's death, Roudette took the skin and combined it with her pre-existing red cloak; initially enchanted to block magic, Roudette had the runes changed so that they deflect fairy magic, the combination of the two cloaks making Roudette immune to magic cast on her directly and able to transform into a wolf.

* The Japanese animated film ''[[Jin-Roh]]'' (1999; also known as ''Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade''), about a secret society within an anti-terrorist unit of an [[alternate history|alternative]] post-World War II Japan, makes several literary and visual references to the German oral version of the story (most notably a ''Rotkäppchen'' book offered to the main character by one of the female bomb couriers), which is closer to the Perrault version, than the tale of Grimm, with an anti-terrorist commando as the wolf (the title is literally "Man-wolf" in Japanese"), and a former terrorist courier as the young lady.

* The computer-animated children's [[film]], ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' (2005), uses the anachronistic parody approach to the tale typified by the ''[[Shrek]]'' films, envisioning the story as a ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''-like mystery in which the [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] animal police of the forest question the four participants of the story after they are detained for an apparent domestic disturbance that the police suspect is tied to the mysterious "Goodie Bandit", a thief who has been stealing sweet shop store owners' books. One by one, each character is interviewed and explains to the police their story of how they got to Granny's house and why, and each story is followed in a lengthy flashback. All four characters are discovered to not quite be what they initially appear to be, and all of their stories have overlap with each other:
**Red Puckett is a worldly wise delivery girl, who gets her name from the red hooded cloak she wears. She is determined to protect her Granny's recipe book after someone breaks into Granny's store.
**Granny Puckett secretly lives a double life as an extreme sports athlete named "Triple G". She participates in a ski race and is nearly killed by the Bandit's henchmen. After incapacitating them by staging an avalanche, she ends up bound and gagged in her own closet when the parachute and ripcord she uses to escape get caught in her ceiling fan after she comes down the chimney.
**The Wolf (full name Wolf W. Wolf) is an investigative journalist. He and his assistant, a hyperactive squirrel named Twitchy, think that Red is somehow involved in the Goodie Bandit thefts.
**Kirk Kirkkendall, the woodsman, is not a lumberjack, but an out-of-work actor who spends his days selling schnitzel out of a truck and has just been auditioned for a foot ointment commercial.

Almost all of the characters in the anime are based on characters from Little Red Riding Hood or other fairytales.

In it, a wolf/human creature is kidnapping young girls who wear red hoodies/jackets. He lures them by leaving a small [[figurine]]. The main character must find him after a little girl is reported missing on her way to her grandfather's house.
* Though not explicitly an adaptation, in an episode of ''[[Kamen Rider Ghost]]'' entitled "Real Worth! The Power of Fun!", Takeru Tenkuji transforms into Kamen Rider Ghost Mugen Damashii in the Dream World, while dressed as Little Red Riding Hood.

==Toys==
*The [[Lego Minifigures (theme)|Lego Minifigure]], "Grandma Visitor", is based on Little Red Riding Hood.
* [[Todd McFarlane]]'s "Twisted Fairy Tales" [[action figure]] line includes a more voluptuous Red Riding Hood holding a dead wolf with its entrails and Grandma dripping out of its stomach. A similar but less gory figure is part of the "Scary Tales" line of figures (not by McFarlane).

==Video games==
* An unlicensed game called ''[[Little Red Hood]]'' was produced for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].
* ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales]]'' includes a pair of storybooks entitled "Mini Red Riding Hood", which uses the popular story as its basis, but instead of being threatened by a wolf, Red has to contend with the lightning spirit [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|Ramuh]] on her way to her grandmother's house.
* [[World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade]] features The Big Bad Wolf as one of the random encounters in the Karazhan opera event. The Wolf transforms a random player into Red Riding Hood and chases her around the room.
* ''Little Red Riding Hood'' is the title of the second episode of the episodic game series ''[[American McGee's Grimm]]'' (2008) which features a dwarf ("Grimm") bent on returning fairy tales to their supposedly much darker origins. American McGee also returned to the theme of Red Riding Hood with his 2010 interactive story for the [[iPad]]: "Akaneiro: A Red Riding Hood Story."
* A 2008 action video game called ''[[Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ]]'' was released for the Nintendo DS. It was developed by [[EnjoyUp]] and published by [[Destineer]] (known for other DS games such as ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy]]'' and ''[[Candy Factory]]'') and got a successful review score of 8.6 at IGN.com.
* The French publisher [[Anuman Interactive]] launched an edutainment software based on Perrault’s tale, ''Little Red Riding Hood'', on PC.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* Former [[Capcom]] designer [[Akira Yasuda|Akira "Akiman" Yasuda]] created a character entitled [[B.B. Hood]] (an acronym for "Baby Bonnie Hood", Japanese name "Bulleta"), who is inspired by the protagonist in the Little Red Riding Hood fables. "Hood" as-it-were is something of a loose interpretation of the character; in that her persona is far more eccentric, volatile, and outlandish then what is typically depicted in the classic tale. This particular character has been seen in subsequent Capcom video game releases including: the ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' video game series (in which she first appeared), and the second installment of the fan-favorite video game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]''.
* ''[[The Path (video game)|The Path]]'', a 2009 [[art game]] by [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Video game developer|developer]] Tale of Tales, is primarily inspired by various older versions of the Red Riding Hood tale.
* ''[[Overlord: Dark Legend]]'' features a mysterious young girl named Li'l Red who asks the Overlord to escort her through the Withering Woods to her grandmother's house near the beginning of the game. However, once they reach her grandmother's house it is revealed that she is actually a "Wolf Queen" in disguise, essentially taking the place of both Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf.
* [[Adventure Quest Worlds]] has a brunette variation of Red Riding Hood, called Red Hunting Hood here. She is a skilled hunter who wants the players' help to hunt down several monsters.
* ''[[Fairytale Fights]]'' has Lil' Red as a playable character.
*In Dark Parables: The Red Riding Hood Sisters, the fourth installment in the Dark Parables franchise, you play as the fabled detective and investigate the appearance the Wolf Queen! Centuries ago, the first Red Riding Hood Isabella was saved from the wolf by the huntsman. He adopted the orphaned girl and taught her how to fight. After he was killed in a wolf attack Isabella established the "Order of Red Riding Hood Sisters" in the Vosges Mountains, Eastern France.
*[[The Wolf Among Us]], a video game adaptation was made from the comic [[Fables (comics)|Fables]] where you play as the Big Bad Wolf, Bigby Wolf. The character Red is only mentioned briefly, mentioning that she didn't survive after the fables escaped their homelands. Later, the Fables series was amended by a comic book adaptation of the game.
*[[Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries]] is a side-scrolling platform hack and slash video game developed and published by Belgian independent development studio GriN Gamestudio.

==Visual art==
*For the Grimm's Fairy tales 200th anniversary, Google featured the Red Little Riding Hood Story as the Google Doodle

'''''Adoration of the Christ Child''''' (Italian: ''Adorazione del Bambino''), is a circa 1619&amp;ndash;1621 [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] by the [[Dutch Golden Age]] artist [[Gerard Honthorst]] in the collection of the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/240573 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The Adoration of the Child shows a moonlit scene with Mary laying the Child in swaddling clothes. Joseph is looking over her shoulder and two angels are leaning over the crib. The moonlight is reflected off the faces in such a way that suggests the Child as a light source. The composition is reminiscent of much earlier versions, such as the 1490 ''[[Nativity at Night]]'' by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]. The "Child as light source" aspect was used again and further exaggerated by Honthorst the next year when he painted the same subject, today held by the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Provenance==
This painting is one of five paintings by Honthorst in the Uffizi, and all of them feature a [[tenebrist]] style that shows why the Italians call him ''Gherardo delle Notti'' or "Gerard of the Night".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/inv1890/scheda.asp?position=1&amp;ninv=739 739] in Florentine museum&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably these were all purchased in 1628 by [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who had just returned from a trip to Northern Europe and sent an intermediary to inquire after "6 paintings" that were for sale in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42718380 Florentijnsche Gegevens II] by J.A.F.

'''''Aerograd''''' ({{lang-ru|Аэроград}}, also referred to as '''''Air City''''' or '''''Frontier''''') is a 1935 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[adventure film]] by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], a coproduction between [[Mosfilm]] and [[Dovzhenko Film Studios|VUFKU]]. It is an adventure story set in the Soviet Far East in the future.

==Plot==
A [[Russia]]n outpost in Eastern [[Siberia]] comes under threat of attack by the [[Japan]]ese in this patriotic film from 1935. Aerograd is a new town with a strategically located airfield of vital interest to the government. Work on the new outpost is complicated when tensions develop between workers and a religious sect. The sect threatens to give their support to a band of marauding [[samurai]] warriors who battle for control of the region. Relations between the two countries are further strained in the days before [[World War II]], dating back to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905. In this feature, the Russians are victorious as airplanes throughout the country come to the aid of the beleaguered new town. Director Alexander Dovzhenko, long considered a giant in Russian classic cinema, also wrote the screenplay for this feature.

'''Alexander Demetrius Goltz''' (25 January 1857, [[Püspökladány]] - 14 May 1944, [[Vienna]]) was a Hungarian-born Austrian painter, illustrator and scenic designer.

== Biography ==
He was the son of a railway engineer and, after the age of two, grew up in Vienna. From 1874 to 1875, he studied with [[Otto Seitz]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]]. Then, for the next two years, he was a student of [[Anselm Feuerbach]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|2|29||Goltz Alexander Demetrius|}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibition was in 1876 and he became a member of the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]].

This was followed by several study trips, a stay in Munich from 1884 to 1888, and studies with [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] in Paris. He finally returned to Vienna in 1892.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Reinhard Müller: [http://agso.uni-graz.at/marienthal/biografien/goltz_alexander_demetrius.htm ''Alexander Demetrius Goltz'']. In: ''Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal'', Juni 2008; retrieved, 18 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning as a history painter, he later turned to landscapes and portraits. From 1904 to 1907, he was in charge of the scenic equipment at the [[Burgtheater]], then held the same position at the [[Vienna State Opera]] from 1909 to 1910.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; During this time, he painted the portraits of numerous performers; notably [[Josef Kainz]].

He was a member of the [[Hagenbund]] from 1900 to 1911 and served as its President for the year 1906/07. During the First World War, he served as a [[battle painter]] for the Imperial {{ill|Kriegspressequartier|de|k.u.k. Kriegspressequartier}} and worked at the fronts in Belgium, Russia, Italy, Serbia and Turkey. Most of these paintings are now on display at the [[Museum of Military History, Vienna|Museum of Military History]].

From 1925 to 1929, he was President of the Artists' Cooperative at the Künstlerhaus. He was married twice. His second wife (who he married in 1909) was the actress Mary Mell (1885-1954), sister of the writer, {{ill|Max Mell|de}}. In 1927, he became a citizen of Vienna and is buried at the [[Zentralfriedhof]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

'''Art Nouveau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|r|t|_|n|uː|ˈ|v|oʊ|,_|ˌ|ɑː|r}}; {{IPA-fr|aʁ nuvo|lang}})  is an international [[style (visual arts)|style]] of art, architecture and [[applied art]], especially the [[decorative arts]], that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reaction to the [[academic art]] of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).  The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as ''[[Vienna Secession|Secessionsstil]]'' after ''[[Wiener Secession]]''; in Spanish ''Modernismo''; in Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]''; in Czech ''Secese''; in Danish ''Skønvirke'' or ''Jugendstil''; in German ''Jugendstil'', Art Nouveau or ''Reformstil''; in Hungarian ''Szecesszió''; in Italian Art Nouveau, ''Stile Liberty'' or  ''Stile floreale''; in Lithuanian ''Modernas''; in Norwegian ''Jugendstil''; in Polish ''Secesja''; in Slovak ''Secesia''; in Ukrainian and Russian ''Модерн'' (Modern)&lt;!--''Ар-нуво'' [Ar-nuvo] or ''Югендстиль'' [JUgendstil']--&gt;; in Swedish and Finnish ''Jugend''.

Art Nouveau is a [[gesamtkunstwerk|total art style]]: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, [[Art Nouveau furniture|furniture]], textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. 

By 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by [[Art Deco]] and then by [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Hope, review of H. Lenning, ''The Art Nouveau'', ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 34 (June 1952), 168–171 (esp. 168–169): Discussing the state of Art Nouveau during 1952, the author notes that Art Nouveau, which had become disfavored, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their respective catalogs. He predicts an impending change, however.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Michèle Lavallée, "Art Nouveau", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Art Nouveau took its name from the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' (''House of the New Art''), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German [[art dealer]] [[Siegfried Bing]] that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style" due to its roots in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], ''Style moderne'', or ''Style 1900.''&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; It was also sometimes called ''Style Jules Verne'', ''Le Style Métro'' (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), ''Art Belle Époque'', and ''Art fin de siècle''.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed ''Style nouille'' (noodle style) or ''Style coup de fouet'' (whiplash style).&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Britain, it was known as the ''Modern Style'', or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow,  as the [[Glasgow School|"Glasgow" style]].

In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co]] department store (mostly designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]), it was sometimes called the ''Stile Liberty'' ("Liberty style"),  ''Stile floral'', or ''Arte nova'' (New Art).

In the United States, due to its association with [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], it was often called the "Tiffany style".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23"&gt;Duncan (1994): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called ''Jugendstil'', after the popular German art magazine of that name.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;  In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a similar style emerged, called ''Secessionsstil'' in German, ({{lang-hu|szecesszió}}, {{lang-cs|secese}}) or ''Wiener Jugendstil'', after the artists of the [[Vienna Secession]].

The style was called ''Modern'' (Модерн) in Russia and ''Nieuwe Kunst'' (new art) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; In Spain the related style was known as ''Modernismo'', ''Modernisme'' (in Catalan), ''Arte joven'' ("young art"); and in Portugal ''Arte nova'' (new art). 

Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: ''Stile Floreal'' ("floral style") in France; ''Paling Stijl'' ("eel style") in the Netherlands;  and ''Wellenstil'' ("wave style") and ''Lilienstil'' ("lily style") in Germany.&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of [[William Morris]], and in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish [[Peacock Room]] by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Heywood Sumner]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Alfred Gilbert]], and especially [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau'' (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], a declared enemy of the historical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]]. In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', he wrote, "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet le-Duc, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

The French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''L'Écho de Paris'', 28 December 1891, cited in Bouillon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=26}}

Another important influence on the new style was [[Japonism]]: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese [[woodblock printing]], particularly the works of [[Hiroshige]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Utagawa Kunisada]] which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising [[Siegfried Bing]] founded a monthly journal, ''Le Japon artistique'' in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including [[Gustav Klimt]]. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain,  jewelry, and furniture.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color [[lithographs]], played an essential role in popularizing the new style. ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' in England, ''Arts et idèes'' and ''Art et décoration'' in France, and ''[[Jugend]]'' in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in England, and [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Félix Vallotton]] achieved international recognition as illustrators.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=30}}

With the posters by [[Jules Cheret]] for dancer [[Loie Fuller]] in 1893, and by [[Alphonse Mucha]] for actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and other artists achieved international celebrity status.

The Franco-German art dealer and publisher [[Siegfried Bing]] played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize [[Japonism]] in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Eugène Grasset]], which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Société nationale des beaux-arts]] in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at [[Rue de Provence|22 rue de Provence]] in Paris, the ''[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]'', devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect [[Henry Van de Velde]], one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' showed paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], glass from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Emile Gallé]], jewelry by [[René Lalique]], and posters by [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies."{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] by Victor Horta and the [[Bloemenwerf]] house by [[Henry Van de Velde]], were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.

Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=127}}

Van de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the [[Bloemenwerf]], the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.

After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, [[Hector Guimard]] built the [[Castel Béranger]], the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under [[Napoleon III]] by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new [[Paris Métro]] system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']].&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm Gontar, Cybele.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Paris 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition universelle'']] marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]: the main exhibit hall, the [[Grand Palais]] had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

The Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: [[Lalique]] crystal and jewelry; jewelry by [[Henri Vever]] and [[Georges Fouquet]]; [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] glass; the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] in [[porcelain]]; ceramics by [[Alexandre Bigot]]; sculpted glass lamps and vases by [[Emile Gallé]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and Company from the United States; furniture by [[Édouard Colonna]] and [[Louis Majorelle]]; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, [[Siegfried Bing]] presented a pavilion called '' Art Nouveau Bing'', which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.&lt;ref name="eidelberg"&gt;Martin Eidelberg and Suzanne Henrion-Giele, "Horta and Bing: An Unwritten Episode of L'Art Nouveau", ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 119, Special Issue Devoted to European Art Since 1890 (Nov. 1977), pp. 747–752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncanbing"&gt;Duncan (1994), pp. 15–16, 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] marked the beginning of the [[Modernisme]] style in Spain, with some buildings of [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]]. The [[Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna (1902)|''Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna'']] of 1902 in [[Turin]], Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by [[Jules Lavirotte]], who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the [[Lavirotte Building]], at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including ''[[Maxim's]]'' at [[Rue Royale, Paris|3 rue Royale]], and [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|''Le Train bleu'']] at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1900).{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the ''Alliance provinciale des industries d'art'', also known as the ''[[École de Nancy]]'', was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts.  The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators [[Emile Gallé]], the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] brothers in glass design, and the designer [[Louis Majorelle]], who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect [[Henri Sauvage]] brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his [[Villa Majorelle]] in 1898.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including ''The Studio'', ''Arts et Idées'' and ''Art et Décoration'', whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion,  virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.

Belgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of [[Victor Horta]], who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] in 1893, and the [[Hôtel Solvay]] in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young [[Hector Guimard]]. Other important designers included architect [[Paul Hankar]], who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer [[Henry van de Velde]], the decorator [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]], and the graphic artist [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescohorta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005|title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of [[ivory]] imported from the [[Belgian Congo]]; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as [[Philippe Wolfers]], was popular.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

In the Netherlands, the style was known as the ''Nieuwe Kunst'', the New Art. Architects included [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], who designed a more functional, rational variant, while [[Carel Adolph Lion Cachet]], [[Theo Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof]] designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern [[Indonesia]]), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of [[batik]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

Prominent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist [[Théophile Steinlen]], creator of the famous poster for the Paris [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir|''Le Chat noir'']], and the artist, sculptor and decorator [[Eugène Grasset]], who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (''École normale d'enseignement du dessin''), where his students included [[Augusto Giacometti]] and [[Paul Berthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan37"&gt;Duncan (1994), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the [[arts and crafts movement]] of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], published in 1883.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers [[Aubrey Beardsley]] whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing [[wrought iron]] from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included [[Walter Crane]] and [[Charles Robert Ashbee|Charles Ashbee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art|date=22 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], with the creations of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow School]], whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]], a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the ''Glasgow Rose".{{Sfn|Lahor|page=160}}

[[Léon-Victor Solon]], made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in [[Tubelining|tube-lined]] vases marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the [[Viennese Secession|Viennese art movement]]).&lt;ref name="Muter"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41809144 | title=Leon Solon and John Wadsworth | work=Journal of the Decorative Arts Society | year=1985 | author=Muter, Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Leek silk industry]]&lt;ref&gt;He was commissioned by the Wardle family of dyers and printers, trading as "Thomas Wardle &amp; Co" and "Bernard Wardle and Co".[http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ The Wardel Pattern Books Revealed]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044031/http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[doublure (bookbinding)|doublure]]s for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the ''Sutherland'' binding in 1895.

The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the [[Former Everard's Printing Works|printing works of Edward Everard]], features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and [[William Morris]], both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, ''Jugendstil''. The name is taken from the artistic journal, ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Die Jugend]]'', which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by [[Georg Hirth]] (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: ''Jugendstil'' ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,&lt;ref&gt;A. Philip McMahon, "review of F. Schmalenbach, ''Jugendstil''", ''Parnassus'', vol. 7 (Oct., 1935), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the forms of organic [[typography]] and [[graphic design]] found in and influenced by German magazines like ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'', ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;Reinhold Heller, "Recent Scholarship on Vienna's "Golden Age", Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele", ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were [[Munich]] and [[Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Mathildenhöhe]]).

Two other journals, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', published in Munich, and ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of ''Jugendstil'', especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] [[poster]]s. Designers often used unique display [[typeface]]s that worked harmoniously with the image.

One of the most famous German artists associated with both ''Die Jugend'' and ''Pan'' was [[Otto Eckmann]]. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the [[leitmotif]] for the Jugendstil.

One of the most prominent German designers in the style was [[Richard Riemerschmid]], who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=52}}

{{Main article|Vienna Secession}}
Vienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]], an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], [[Max Kurzweil]], and [[Otto Wagner]]. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward [[historicism]] expressed by [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, ''[[Ver Sacrum]]'', to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the ''Jugendstil'' in neighboring Germany.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=63}} The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the [[Stoclet Palace]] built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. [[Koloman Moser]] was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of [[Ödön Faragó]] in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. [[Pál Horti]], another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

[[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the ''Hotel Central'' and the [[Jubilee Synagogue]], built in 1908.

The style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] architect [[Dušan Jurkovič]] who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in [[Skalica]] in [[Slovakia]] (1905), buildings of spa in [[Luhačovice]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near [[Nowy Żmigród]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the [[Church of St. Elisabeth (Bratislava)|Church of St. Elisabeth]] (The Little Blue Church) in [[Bratislava]].

Italy's ''Stile Liberty'' took its name from the British department store [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]], the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included [[Galileo Chini]], whose ceramics were inspired both by [[majolica]] patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas  ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]''.

The [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]], by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]], is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.

The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was [[Carlo Bugatti]], the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the [[Brera Academy|Milanese Academy of Brera]], and later the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=310}}

In Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]'', appeared in [[Barcelona]]. Its most famous creator was [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]], who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1886).{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=142}}&lt;ref&gt;James Grady, ''Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau'', in "The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs from about 1903, the ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1904–1906) and ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan52"&gt;Duncan (1994): 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, famous structures such as the ''[[Sagrada Família]]'' characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist [[Neo-Gothic]].&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the [[Castell dels Tres Dragons]] (1888), [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] and [[Casa Lleó Morera]] (1905).&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Another major modernista was [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the [[Casa Martí]] and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the [[Caixa Forum|CaixaFòrum]] art museum), Casa Macaya, [[Casa Amatller]], the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes ("House of Spikes"). Also well-known is [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with houses in [[Sant Joan Despí]] (1913–1926), several churches near [[Tarragona]] (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in [[Barcelona]]. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in [[Terrassa]] (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a "farmhouse"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], with his spectacular "wine cathedrals", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central [[Catalonia]]. A [[Valencian Country|Valencian]] architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the [[United States|States]] was [[Rafael Guastavino]]. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in [[Castellar de n'Hug]], among other buildings.

The Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=311}} Examples of Art Nouveau (''Arte nova''), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in [[Porto]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].  A notable example is the '[[Livraria Lello]]' bookstore in [[Porto]], designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).

Art Nouveau was popular in the [[Nordic countries]], where it was usually known as [[Jugendstil]], and was often combined with the [[National Romantic Style]] of each country. In [[Norway]] the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by [[Viking]] folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and [[Celts|Celtic]] patterns, and [[Gerhard Munthe]], who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}} Other examples include the [[Skien Church]] (1887–1894) and [[Fagerborg Church]] in [[Kristiania]] (Oslo) (1900–1903).

In [[Finland]], good examples are the [[Helsinki Central railway station]], designed by [[Eliel Saarinen]], father of the famous American modernist architect [[Eero Saarinen]]. Examples of the style include the [[Finnish National Theatre]], [[Kallio Church]], the [[Finnish National Museum]], and [[Tampere Cathedral]]. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/article/the-charm-of-old-helsinki/|title=The Charm of Old Helsinki — VisitFinland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnouveau.eu/en/city.php?id=136|title=Art Nouveau European Route : Cities|website=www.artnouveau.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "Мир искусства" (transliteration: ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'') ("The World of Art"), by Russian artists [[Alexandre Benois]] and [[Léon Bakst]], and chief editor [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Konstantin Somov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], and the book illustrator [[Ivan Bilibin]]. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'', headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, ''[[L'Illustration]]'', [[La Vie Parisienne (magazine)|''La Vie parisienne'']] and [[Gazette du Bon Ton|''Gazette du bon ton'']], and the Russian style became known in Paris as ''à la Bakst''. The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alistair, ''Art déco'', Thames and Hudson (1988), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the [[Hotel Metropol (Moscow)|Hotel Metropol]] in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, ''The Princess of Dreams'', by scenic designer [[Mikhail Vrubel]];  and the [[Vitebsk Railway Station]] in Saint Petersburg (1904)

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the United States, the firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of [[Thomas Edison]], he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''1900 Exposition Universelle'']] in Paris; his stained glass window called the ''Flight of Souls'' won a gold medal.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=167}}

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect [[Louis Sullivan]], best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned ''White City'', he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].

==Form and character==
[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La tournée du Chat noir de Rodolphe Salis'' (1896) by [[Théophile Steinlen]]]]

Although Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in ''Pan'' magazine of [[Hermann Obrist]]'s wall hanging ''Cyclamen'' (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan27"&gt;Duncan (1994): 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as ''The Whiplash'' but the term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.&lt;ref name="duncan27" /&gt; Such decorative "whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist [[William Morris]] to the cluttered compositions and the [[Gothic revival|revival]] tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the [[Arts and crafts movement]].&lt;ref name="duncan10"&gt;Duncan (1994): 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s book-cover for ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s City Churches'' (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan10" /&gt; About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block prints]], especially those of [[Katsushika Hokusai]], had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan14"&gt;Duncan (1994): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Japonisme]]'' that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world.&lt;ref name ="duncan14" /&gt; Besides being adopted by artists like [[Emile Gallé]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen [[Siegfried Bing]] and [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]] at their stores&lt;ref&gt;Before opening the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'', Bing managed a shop specialising in items from Japan; after 1888, he promoted Japanism with his magazine [[Artistic Japan|''Le Japon artistique'']]: Duncan (1994): 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris and London, respectively.&lt;ref name="duncan14" /&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed: "One of the first Art Nouveau paintings can be found at [[Roquetaillade castle]] (France). [[Viollet-le-Duc]] restored the castle during the 1850s, and, even though his ideal was to create a [[Gothic revival]], his [[fresco]] in the keep of the castle is a pure example of "pre" Art Nouveau style—organic movement and color. "--&gt;
[[File:Immeuble rue de l'église détail Porte.jpg|thumb|upright|Doorway at 24 place Etienne Pernet, ([[15th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 15e]]), 1905 Alfred Wagon, architect.]]

In architecture, [[hyperbola]]s and [[parabola]]s in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative [[:molding (decorative)|mouldings]] 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of [[Rococo]] style, such as [[flame]] and [[Animal shell|shell]] textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use [[seaweed]], [[grass]]es, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century [[auricular style]], best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|left|upright0.1||''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] (1907)]]
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] styles, and artists like [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Jan Toorop]] could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the [[artisan]]-oriented [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and [[abstraction]] in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726155845/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }} Edmond Lachenal produced editions of Rodin's sculptures&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many [[technology|technological]] innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.
 
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In [[Denmark]], for example, it was one aspect of ''Skønvirke'' ("aesthetic work"), which itself more closely relates to the [[Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Opie, ''A Dish by Thorvald Bindesbøll'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 132 (May, 1990), pp. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", in ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 4 (Spring, 1987), pp. 16–29 (esp. 18 n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the ''[[Młoda Polska]]'' ("Young Poland") style in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Danuta A. Boczar, ''The Polish Poster'', in ''Art Journal'', vol. 44 (Spring, 1984), pp. 16–27 (esp. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Młoda Polska'', however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Batorska, "Zofia Stryjeńska: Princess of Polish Painting", in ''Woman's Art Journal'', vol. 19 (Autumn, 1998–Winter, 1999), pp. 24–29 (esp. 24–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color [[lithography]] which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', then black and white illustrations for [[Salome]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine ''The Studio'', which helped publicize European artists such as [[Fernand Khnopff]] in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=99}}

The Swiss-French artist [[Eugène Grasset]] (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret [[Le Chat Noir|Le Chat noir]] in 1885 and made his first posters for the ''Fêtes de Paris''. He made a celebrated posters of [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers [[Jules Chéret]], [[Georges de Feure]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play ''[[Gismonda]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]]. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;''[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/muchalecture.htm An Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau]'', lecture by [[Ian Johnston (academic)|Ian Johnston]] of [[Malaspina University-College]], [[Nanaimo]], British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Julie. H. [http://www.style2000.com/p05b.html "Recycling art"] style2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure.  He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=112}}

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was [[Koloman Moser]] (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, ''Ver Sacrum'', as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.{{Sfn|Lahor|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Painting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the [[Nabis]] in France and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] in France and Austria. In 1892, [[Siegfried Bing]] organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], and [[Maurice Denis]]; and his ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' exhibited paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, [[Fernand Khnopff]] worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of [[Josef Hoffmann]] for the [[Palais Stoclet]]. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer [[Loie Fuller]], portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau (1870-1914)'', Skira, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass art]] was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of [[Emile Gallé]] and the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] studio, led by [[Auguste Daum|Auguste]] and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including [[Ernest Bussière]], [[Henri Bergé]], and [[Amalric Walter]]. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]], whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the [[Villa Majorelle]] and other houses.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=318}}

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of [[Val Saint Lambert]], which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by [[Philippe Wolfers]]. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of [[symbolist]] glass, often with metal decoration attached. In [[Bohemia]], then a region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] noted for crystal manufacture, the companies [[Lobmeyr]] and [[Loetz-Witwe]] also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; [[Otto Prutscher]] was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] for the architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."

In the United States, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process [[Favrile glass]], which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the [[Tiffany lamp]] in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by [[Siegfried Bing]], and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, [[Steuben Glass]], was founded in 1903 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, NY]], by [[Frederick Carder]], who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was [[John La Farge]], who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

The 19th-century architectural theorist [[Viollet-le-Duc]] had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Hector Guimard]] went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=322}}

In the United States, the designer [[George Grant Elmslie]] made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]].

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=324}}

Art Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], or [[citrine quartz|citrine]].&lt;ref name="Art Nouveau Jewelry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/art-nouveau|title=Art Nouveau Jewelry|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including [[agate]], [[garnet]] [[opal]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]] and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others [[vitreous enamel|enameling]], and new materials, including [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], molded glass, and [[ivory]].

Early notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included [[Louis Aucoc]], whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, [[René Lalique]], served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as [[Paul Follot]], best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included [[Jules Brateau]] and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work was shown at the shop of [[Siegfried Bing]] and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. designer [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. [[C. R. Ashbee]] designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile [[Glasgow]] designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for ''Jugendstil'' jewelry was the city of [[Pforzheim]], where most of the German firms, including [[Theodor Fahrner]], were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

The style first appeared in Brussels' [[Hôtel Tassel]] (1894) and [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1900) of [[Victor Horta]]. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by [[Hector Guimard]], who used the same style in his first major work, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new [[Paris Métro]], which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], the prefect of Paris under [[Napoleon III]]. [[Bow window]]s were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of [[Jules Lavirotte]], which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], around the [[Villa Majorelle]] (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]. It was designed by [[Henri Sauvage]] as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings;  the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], where two major designers, [[Émile Gallé]] and [[Louis Majorelle]] had their studios and workshops, and where the ''Alliance des industries d'art'' (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of [[marquetry]] in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included [[Eugène Vallin]] and [[Émile André]]; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included [[Henri Bellery-Desfontaines]], who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]; and [[Georges de Feure]], [[Eugène Gaillard]], and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its [[rococo]] influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was [[François-Rupert Carabin]], a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Other influential Paris furniture designers were [[Charles Plumet]], and [[Alexandre Charpentier]].{{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}}  In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century [[Rococo]] furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the ''Art Nouveau movement'', [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]], designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration.  The Belgian designer [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called ''Nieuwe Kunst'' or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration.&lt;ref name="Lucie-Smith, 160"&gt;Lucie-Smith, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of [[Peter Behrens]] and the [[Jugendstil]] was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] in Vienna, led by [[Otto Wagner]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], Josef Maria Olbrich and [[Koloman Moser]]. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the [[Biedemeier]] style.{{Sfn|RIley|2007|page=308}}
 
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. [[Carlo Bugatti]] in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of [[Antoni Gaudi]] and the ''Modernismo'' movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was [[Charles Rohlfs]] in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of [[Celtic Art]] and [[Gothic art]], with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (''grand feu'') porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional [[Stoneware|''grés'']] methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, [[Jules Lavirotte]] and [[Hector Guimard]] among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of [[Alexandre Bigot]], giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was [[Ernest Chaplet]], whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter [[Paul Gauguin]] on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors [[Félix Bracquemond]], [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] outside Paris; [[Nymphenburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]] in Germany, and [[Doulton Industrial Products|Doulton]] in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included [[Taxile Doat]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat|fr}}, [[Edmond Lachenal]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Dammouse|fr}} and [[Auguste Delaherche]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edmond Lachenal and His Legacy'', by Martin Eidelberg, Claire Cass, Hudson Hills Press; illustrated edition (25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine ''Dancer with a Scarf'' by [[Agathon Léonard]], made for the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The [[Zsolnay|Zsolnay factory]] in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]], was led by [[Miklós Zsolnay]] (1800–1880) and his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900,) with [[Tádé Sikorski]] (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of [[eosin]]. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Fair in Vienna]], then at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World Fair in Paris]], where Zsolnay received a ''Grand Prix''. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarkeramia.hu/keramia/zsolnay/page_en.html Timeline], accessed 1/23/08&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs o[[William Morris]] had helped launch the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty department store]] in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the [[Silver Studio]], which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from [[Glasgow School]], and [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]]. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of Glasgow".

In France, a major contribution was made by designer [[Eugène Grasset]] who in 1896 published ''La Plante et ses applications ornamentales'', suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer [[Hermann Obrist]]  specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian [[Henry van de Velde]] presented a textile work, ''La Veillée d'Anges'', at the Salon ''La Libre Esthéthique'' in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of [[Paul Gauguin]] and of the [[Nabis]]. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by [[batik]] patterns from the Dutch colonies in the [[East Indies]]. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of [[Gerhard Munthe]] and [[Frida Hansen]] in Norway. The ''Five Swans'' design of [[Otto Eckmann]] appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer [[János Vaszary]] combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=328}}

He started composing music in the early 1980s, and his first Punjabi album was of the singer [[Hakam Sufi]], titled "Mela Yaaran Da". From there he went on to compose music for numerous albums for artistes like [[Hans Raj Hans]], [[Sardool Sikander]], [[Kuldip Manak]], [[Gurdas Maan]], as well as Punjabi movies like "Jatt Jeaona Mour" (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ravi|first1=Ravinder|title=Jatt Jeona Mor (1991)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316054/|website=imdb.com|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Badla Jatti Da" (1991), delivering many multi platinum selling albums on the way.

====Surjit Bindrakhia====

During this time, he mentored a then young and raw singer [[Surjit Bindrakhia]]. Along with the lyricist Samsher Singh Sandhu, the three formed perhaps one of most legendary and finest team in Punjabi music.

'''Buddha Park''', also known as '''Xieng Khuan''' (as well as other variations of the spelling), is a [[sculpture garden|sculpture park]] located 25 km southeast from [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]] in a [[meadow]] by the [[Mekong|Mekong River]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Cranmer|author2=Steven Martin|author3=Kirby Coxon|title=Rough guide to Laos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSTQdorOvr0C&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=November 2002|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-905-2|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nick Ray|author2=Thomas Huhti|title=Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos &amp; the Greater Mekong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9i1zYNbcgwsC&amp;pg=PA271|accessdate=18 June 2011|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-761-5|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not a [[temple]] (''Wat''), the park may be referred to as '''Wat Xieng Khuan''' ([[Lao language|Lao]]: ວັດຊຽງຄວນ;{{lang-th|วัดเซียงควน}}), since it contains numerous religious images.&lt;ref name="Staff2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Let's Go, Inc.

==Overview==
[[File:BuddhaPark from Thai.jpg|thumb|200px|The top of the `pumpkin' tower in Buddha Park, seen through the trees from the Thai side of Mekong.]]
The park was started in 1958 by Luang Pu (Venerable Grandfather) [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]].&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a [[priest]]-[[Shamanism|shaman]] who integrated [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; His unique perspective was influenced by a Hindu [[rishi]] under whom he studied in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jock O'Tailan|title=Footprint Laos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHd2sa4IBFUC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=17 June 2008|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-906098-18-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution in 1975, anxious about the repercussions of the rule of [[Pathet Lao]], he fled from [[Laos]] to [[Thailand]] where he built another sculpture park, [[Sala Keoku]] in [[Nong Khai]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"/&gt; Both parks are located right next to the Thai-Lao border (Mekong river), only a few kilometers apart from each other, and the tallest structures of the Buddha Park can actually be seen from the Thai side of Mekong. 

The statues are made of [[reinforced concrete]] and are ornate, and sometimes bizarre, in design.&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"/&gt; The statues appear to be centuries old, though they are not. There are sculptures of [[human]]s, [[Deity|gods]], [[animal]]s, and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="www.visit-mekong.com"/&gt; There are numerous sculptures of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], characters of Buddhist beliefs like [[Avalokiteśvara]], and characters of [[Hindu mythology|Hindu lore]], including [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt;  These sculptures were presumably cast by unskilled workers under the supervision of Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat.&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; One notable sculpture resembles a giant [[pumpkin]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt; It has three stories representing three levels - [[Hell]], [[Earth]] and [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt; Visitors can enter through an opening which is a mouth of a {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall [[demon]] head}} and climb [[Stairway|staircase]]s from hell to heaven.&lt;ref name="www.visit-mekong.com"/&gt; Each story contains sculptures depicting the level.

A '''chew toy''' is a [[toy]] designed to be chewed by animals for purposes of stimulation and relief from boredom .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogproofball.com/5477815.html Dog chew toy (United States Patent 5477815)]&lt;/ref&gt; The act of gnawing on a chew toy is meant to be soothing and to assist small animals, like puppies, in event of easing the pain when breaking in their adult teeth as the chewing process releases feel-good chemicals from the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogproofball.com/how-to-prevent-puppy-chewing-problems How to Prevent Puppy Chewing Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different types of chew toys, including [[Rawhide (textile)|rawhide]], [[wood]], [[paper]] and [[mineral]].  Chew toys are commonly associated with [[puppies]] and [[dog]]s, though they are also used for [[bird]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[rabbit]]s.

Chew toys are a vital part of a happy, healthy animal's life.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In addition to providing hours of entertainment, they also allow the animal to work out anxiety and boredom by being occupied with chewing a toy.  Chew toys also distract small animals from chewing on other "forbidden" items, and they assist in maintaining healthy teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_12162339|title=Use chew toys, leash to help train puppies|last=Lynn Smith|first=Chandra|date=2009-04-19|publisher=The Evening Sun|accessdate=2009-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903211938/http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_12162339|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar toy called a [[Teether]] is also given to human children as a soothing tool to help soothe inflamed gums during teething.

==Rawhide==
[[File:Dog with rawhide chew toy.jpg|thumb|right|A dog with a rawhide chew toy.]]
[[Rawhide (textile)|Rawhide]] chew toys are most often associated with puppies and dogs, though rawhide toys are plentiful in the bird toy section of most pet stores. Rawhide is suitable for all animals except [[herbivores]], as it is made of animal skin. Rabbits, which only eat vegetation, cannot have rawhide toys because their digestive systems cannot process them. This is a rather sturdy kind of chew toy and it can take months for a small animal or bird to destroy.  Examples of rawhide chew toys are twists and rawhide bones. Chew toys made of leather are not recommended for dogs as they cannot be properly digested in the stomach and may cause blockage in the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parent |first=Lucia E. |authorlink= |author2=Lucia Roesel-Parent |editor= |others= |title=Beagles: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Handling, and |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKxxFgRbz74C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22dog+toy%22+leather&amp;lr=&amp;sig=xSXCcsMpGIpgHpvnLCTSWrOzAxE |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2003 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location= |language= |isbn=0-7641-2002-6 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood==
[[Wood]] chew toys are made of a safe, non-poisonous, softer wood and are often coated in bright, vegetable-based dyes or paints. Wooden chew toys are given in place of the wood that small animals would find in the wild. They are a safe alternative for a small animal owner to purchase if the owner has no knowledge of the trees and shrubs growing in their area. They are generally used as either small rodents toys or rabbit toys. Wooden chew toys help to keep teeth trimmed down, preventing eating difficulties in pets and unnecessary trips to a vet  for teeth clipping. An example of a wooden chew toy is the commercial product toy ropes

==Paper==
[[Paper]] chew toys are made of non bleached  non-toxic paper. They are an inexpensive, or often free, option for small pet owners and can provide hours of stimulation and play for small animals. One common paper chew toy is an empty [[toilet paper]] tube. These can double as tunnels for very small rodents, and can also be used as modified [[piñatas]] for larger small animals. Wadded up [[newspaper]] pages, old spineless books, and the commercial product ''Chubes'' are other commonly used paper chew toys.

==Mineral==
[[Mineral]] chew toys are made of flavored animal-safe minerals. These range from flavored fruit-shaped blocks for birds to ice-cream cone shaped mineral treats for rabbits. They also come shaped as bowls with fluffy minerals inside. A common mineral chew toy is the [[cuttlebone]], a toy for birds that helps to keep nails and beaks trimmed and healthy.

==Rubber==
[[File:Dog enjoying black kong toy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A dog eating treats out of a Kong, a rubber chew toy.]]
There is a variety of [[rubber]] chew toys for dogs on the market that are molded into different shapes. Some of them are hollowed so that treats can be placed in them. This way, the dog has to "work" to get a treat. Rubber is a good chew toy for dogs but is unhealthy for small animals

The '''director of audiography''', (DA) within Indian-style [[filmmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/india/ The Culture-Specific Use of Sound in Indian Cinema (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the head of the sound department and the person responsible for planning the [[audiography]]  and managing the audiographers of a film. 
The title is not used professionally in most of the world. The role of audiographer and the title "director of audiography" derives from [[Bollywood]]-style filmmaking in India, where it is an established title credit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254967/fullcredits#cast Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276628/combined Yehi Hai Zindagi (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120456/fullcredits#cast Virasat (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0991346/fullcredits#cast Bhoothnath (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The DA works to carry out the [[Film director|director's]] vision, identifies the tasks necessary to realize this vision, budgets for those tasks and coordinates all the work from pre-production to post-production whilst keeping an eye on overall sound quality.

Since the onset of the "[[talkies]]", a creative and professional conflict has emerged from the ongoing tension between the visual and aural dimensions of film. Production sound crews often complain about the lack of consideration given to sound on film productions.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/production-sound/openletter.htm An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.0)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curleysound.com/soundltr.pdf  An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Having a DA in pre-production helps to exert a powerful presence to defend the dimension of sound in film.

In the early days of the Hollywood [[studio system]], every studio had a sound director (SD)&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or a recording director (RD), who headed the sound department and took sole credit for the work done by a large crew of sound technicians.
&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsound.org/murch/stretching.htm Walter Murch]&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood sound editor David Yewdall bemoans the loss of the SD in [[Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and recalls the story of [[film producer]] Ross Hunter, working on the film ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', who neglected to take the advice of sound editor Joe Sikorski to record aircraft sound effects on location; an SD would have immediately appreciated the financial implications of ''not'' taking such advice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 116) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the studio system and the loss of the sound director, part of this role was delegated to the post-production supervisor, [[supervising sound editor]], [[sound designer]] or [[production sound mixer]] - each role allegedly having less influence, responsibility and scope than the former SD. Where no DA is hired - as is the case when making films in the [[Western world|West]] - there has been some debate on the most appropriate role to head the sound department; a supervising sound editor is seen as a technical manager - comparable to an [[art director]] - whereas a sound designer is viewed as a creative visionary, analogous to a [[production designer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994), page. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sounds of Movies'' by Nicholas Pasquariello (1996, 1997), page. 130&lt;/ref&gt; 
In practice, the industry sees both roles as equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amps.net/ AMPS website] - see the note on Supervising Sound Editors in the Directory of Members PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The DA should not be confused with a production supervisor or post-production supervisor - both are administrative roles in the production department. In contrast, the DA is a technical role blending leadership, management and administrative skills with creative audiography ranging over pre-production, production and post-production - constrained only by the Director's vision and the production's schedule and budget. In many ways the DoA role is a natural extension of the more limited post-production role of supervising sound editor.

The term director of sound (DoS) has also been proposed as an alternative title to that of DA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/QA/sound-design-philosophy.htm Randy Thom]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''double-sided painting''' is a [[canvas]] which has a [[painting]] on either side. Historically, [[artist]]s would often paint on both sides out of need of material. The [[wikt:subject-matter|subject matter]] of the two paintings was sometimes, although not normally, related.

'''Emil Thoroddsen''' (June 16, 1898 &amp;ndash; July 7, 1944) was an Icelandic composer, pianist, playwright, critic and translator. He was the chief art critic of "Morgunblaðið" newspaper from 1926–1933 and worked for the [[RÚV|Icelandic National Broadcasting Service]] since its establishment in 1930. Among his most widely known songs are „Íslands Hrafnistumenn“ and „Hver á sér fegra föðurland“ which was premiered at the Festival of the Republic in 1944, shortly before he far too prematurely died from pneumonia.

In his youth, Emil practiced sports among young men from his neighborhood and was involved in the creation of the football club [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavik]] at the age of twelve, hosting the club's inaugural meeting and initially taking the role of club secretary. He later produced coverage about the club's operations and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Mbl.is Archives.

The '''flag of the [[City of London]]''' is based on the [[flag of England]], having a centred [[red]] [[St George's Cross]] on a [[white]] background, with the red [[sword]] in the upper hoist [[Flag terminology|canton]] (the top left quarter). The sword is believed to represent the sword that beheaded [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] who is the [[patron saint]] of the city. The tip of the sword always points upwards; therefore, when the flag is held on its side as a banner, the sword would be printed to face hoist and would be located on the left as it is hanging down (see [[#Usage|below]]).

This flag does not represent [[Greater London]] (which does not have its own flag, aside from the banner of the arms of the former [[Greater London Council]]), only the historical [[City of London]] which covers approximately {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. All references in this article relate to that city, not Greater London, unless specified.

==Symbolism and history==
[[File:Coat of Arms of The City of London.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms|Arms]] of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of the City of London]]: ''Argent, a cross gules in the first quarter a sword in pale point upwards of the last''; [[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]]: ''Two dragons with wings elevated and addorsed argent on each wing a cross gules''; [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]: ''On a dragon's wing displayed [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] a cross gules''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca19.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The flag is a [[banner of arms]], derived from [[Coat of arms of the City of London|the city's coat of arms]] with the sword symbolising the sword that beheaded [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] who is the [[patron saint]] of the city. Saint Paul has featured as a symbol of the city since about the 13th century. His full figure representation was rapidly replaced with his symbolic representation of the sword.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

Some believe the sword is a [[dagger]] that commemorates the dagger of Sir [[William Walworth]], former [[Lord Mayor of London]], which killed [[Wat Tyler]], leader of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], in 1381. A  verse at [[Fishmongers' Hall]] may explain the relationship:
:
"Brave Walworth, Knight, lord mayor that slew&lt;br /&gt;
Rebellious Tyler in his alarmes;&lt;br /&gt;
The king therefore did give him in lieu&lt;br /&gt;
The dagger to the city armes.

However this is believed to be a fable, with the sword on the arms being used several months before the killing of Wat Tyler (Tyler being stabbed in June, and the Arms being designed in April&lt;ref name="COL"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040302214758/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/leisure_heritage/libraries_archives_museums_galleries/clro/pdf/cityarms.PDF  The City Arms], City of London Corporation, hosted by webarchive&lt;/ref&gt;).

The earliest mention of the city's coat of arms was on 17 April 1381 when the old seal was deemed "ill-befitting the honour of the City" and a replacement commissioned by Walworth. Both Saint Paul and [[Saint Thomas Becket]] featured in the previous design and were carried over to the new one similar to the modern design.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Flag of the City of London banner.png|thumb|150px|Flag shown when displayed as banner]]
[[File:London, Tower Bridge - coat of arms and flags - geograph.org.uk - 560793.jpg|left|thumb|Flag flying on Tower Bridge]]
The flag flies from various buildings in the city such as the formal buildings of [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] (the seat of power in the city) and [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], the [[official residence]] of the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (the Lord Mayor has a variant of the flag, defaced with his coat of arms).

It can also be seen on sites outside the city that are administered by the [[City of London Corporation]] (the governing body) such as on [[Tower Bridge]], the Animal Reception Centre at [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Hampstead Heath]]. It can also be seen on certain landmarks, such as the bridges maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]].

The flag is used on the [[One pound (British coin)|one pound coin]] design of 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">In [[art criticism]] of the 1960s and 1970s, '''flatness''' described the smoothness and absence of curvature or surface detail of a two-dimensional work of art.  Critic [[Clement Greenberg]] believed that flatness, or two-dimensional, was an essential and desirable quality in [[painting]], a criterion which implies rejection of [[painterliness]] and [[impasto]].  The valorization of flatness led to a number of art movements, including [[minimalism]] and [[post-painterly abstractionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artlex.com/ArtLex/Fi.html Art-Lex], "Flat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wolfe]], ''The Painted Word'' (Bantam, 1975: {{ISBN|0-553-38065-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]] of the arts happened during the second half of the 19th century and extended into most of the 20th. This period of art is identified by art forms consisting of an image on a flat two-dimensional surface. This art evolution began in the 1860s and culminated 50 years later. By this time almost all three-dimensional works had been eliminated. This new approach to painting was to create a visual appearance of realism. Looking at a surface with only two-dimensions our perception of depth is an illusion. The reduction of depth in painting was the consequence of investigation. This new essence of self-analysis attempted to establish an experience or effect from the viewer of the painting.&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Croddy. “Explaining Modernism,” n.d. http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestCrod.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flatness''' can be used to describe much of the popular American art work of the 1950s and 1960s. The art of this period had a basic yet colorful design that held a degree of two dimensional form. Thus the term '''flatness''' is used to describe this medium. The ground work idea for [[Minimalism]] began in Russia in 1913 when [[Kazimir Malevich]] placed a black square on a white background claiming that: “Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object as such, and believes that it can exist in and for itself without things.”&lt;ref&gt; Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first [[Minimalism]] artworks was created in 1964 by [[Dan Flavin]]. He produced a neon sculpture titled ''Monument for V. Tatlin''. This work was a simplistic assembly of neon tubes that were not carved or constructed in any way. The idea was that they were not supposed to symbolize anything but to just merely exist. The Minimalist approach to art was to conceive by the mind before execution. Traditional modes of art composition were looked away from in favor of improvisation, spontaneity and automatism. This new expressionist style consisted of improvised pattern making where every stroke of the brush was viewed as expression and subjective freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept inspired a whole new art form called [[Pop Art]]. It retained the color scheme and simplicity of [[Minimalism]], but it borrowed images from pop culture to become relatable. The works now in question held a meaning for the viewer with familiar imagery but it still retained the [[avant-garde]] approach of [[Minimalism]]. [[Pop Art]] is a well-recognized movement for 1960s culture. This type of art was very free form fashionable and rebellious. It was wild and colorful but many works retained the idea of two dimensional '''flatness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Sandler. American Art Of The 1960s. Harper and Row, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop Art]] fell out of fashion and a new movement came into being. [[Op Art]] or Optic Art was now the latest trend in home décor and fashion. This form of modern art shares a strong relationship with the culture thought and design of the 1960s. This new art form focused on non-objective painting that focused on design, color, form, and line. These paintings where hand drawn or created with a mechanical aid. They featured a flat looking two dimensional design that could appear to pop out in an almost three dimensional form. Some pieces look as if they are moving due to shape and line placement creating a trick of the eye. This form of art was created to test the limits of the conscious perception of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt; Houston, Joe. Optic Nerve Perceptual Art Of The 1960s. London, New York: Merrell Publishers Limited, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright colors were no longer favored as much of [[Op Art]] is black and white with little use of color. The designs presented migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is [[Bridget Riley]] who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to pull the eye in such a way to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley composes her art with the thought in mind; that we all have a narrow view on how we see things and our vision is rarely stretched to new abilities. Her work confronts the observer with new imaginative sensations, and the overall purpose of the artist’s disappears and is replaced with what the viewer conceives. This form of art has no clear outlined theme therefore it allows total freedom for one to compose their imagination. Riley’s work ignores object and instead focuses on movement to create a seemingly endless pattern. Riley’s art appeared in the fashion of that era. Similar patterns still remain popular in clothing today.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utrecht]], [[Museum Catharijneconvent]]. The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'' {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For about a thousand years, in obedience to interpretations of specific [[Bible]] passages, pictorial '''depictions of God in Western Christianity''' had been avoided by [[Christian]] artists. At first only the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], often emerging from a cloud, was portrayed.  Gradually, portrayals of the head and later the whole figure were depicted, and by the time of the [[Renaissance]] artistic representations of [[God the Father]] were freely used in the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'', {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

God the Father can be seen in some late Byzantine [[Cretan School]] icons, and ones from the borders of the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, under Western influence, but after the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] came down firmly against depicting him in 1667, he can hardly be seen in Russian art.  Protestants generally disapprove of the depiction of God the Father, and originally did so strongly.

==Background and early history==
Early Christians believed that the words of [[Book of Exodus]] 33:20 "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live" and of the [[Gospel of John]] 1:18: "No man hath seen God at any time" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father.&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"&gt;James Cornwell, 2009 ''Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art'' {{ISBN|0-8192-2345-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enluminure Drogon c.jpg|thumb|The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] symbol in the [[Ascension of Christ|Ascension]] from the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850]]
The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], an artistic metaphor, is found several times in the only ancient [[synagogue]] with a large surviving decorative scheme, the [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into [[Early Christian art]] from [[Jewish art]]. It was common in [[Late Antique]] art in both East and West, and remained the main way of depicting the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. It also represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Jewish depictions.

Historically considered, God the Father is more frequently manifested in the [[Old Testament]], while the Son is manifested in the [[New Testament]]. Hence it might be said that the Old Testament refers more especially to the history of the Father and the New Testament to that of the Son. Yet, in early depictions of scenes from the Old Testament, artists used the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] to represent the Father,&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167&lt;/ref&gt; especially in depictions of the story of [[Adam and Eve]], the most frequently depicted Old Testament narrative shown in Early Medieval art, and one that was felt to require the depiction of a figure of God "walking in the garden" (Genesis 3:8).

The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ, [[God the Son]].  From the 4th century the church was also keen to affirm the doctrine of [[consubstantiality]] confirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.


It was therefore usual to have depictions of Jesus as Logos taking the place of the Father and creating the world alone, or commanding [[Noah's Ark|Noah]] to construct the ark or speaking to Moses from the [[Burning bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167-170&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a brief period in the 4th century when the [[Trinity]] were depicted as three near-identical figures, mostly in depicting scenes from Genesis; the [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] in the Vatican is the best known example.  In isolated cases this iconography is found throughout the Middle Ages, and revived somewhat from the 15th century, though it [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|attracted increasing disapproval]] from church authorities.  A variant is [[Enguerrand Quarton]]'s contract for the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] requiring him to represent the Father and Son of the Holy Trinity as identical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Thiébaut: "Enguerrand Quarton", Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://www.groveart.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar has suggested that the enthroned figure in the centre of the [[apse]] mosaic of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome of 390-420, normally regarded as Christ, in fact represents [[God the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Suggestion by F.W. Sclatter, see review by W. Eugene Kleinbauer of ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'', by Thomas F. Mathews, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations, such as the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] was used, with increasing freedom from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]] until the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].  This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], seems to have been borrowed from [[Jewish art]], and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.

The use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of [[Byzantine]] coin types in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, 1985 ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the [[Council of Trullo]] in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of [[Christ]] were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (literally ''image-breaking'') started. Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717&amp;ndash;741), suppressed the use of icons by [[emperor|imperial]] [[edict]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons.&lt;ref&gt;According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes&lt;/ref&gt; The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.

==The end of iconoclasm==
[[File:Gottvater thronend Westfalen 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|240px|God the Father on a throne, with the [[Virgin Mary]] and Jesus, [[Westphalia]], Germany, late 15th century.]]
The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 effectively ended the first period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, 1995 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' {{ISBN|0-679-60148-1}} page 1693&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint [[John of Damascus]], drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

In his treatise ''On the Divine Images'' John of Damascus wrote: "In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see".&lt;ref&gt;St. John of Damascus, ''Three Treatises on the Divine Images'' {{ISBN|0-88141-245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole [[Trinity]] before Christ remains true for the Father and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ermitorio del Calvario 5.jpg|thumb|left|Calvary hermitage, [[L'Alcora|Alcora]], Spain, 18th century.]]
Around 790 [[Charlemagne]] ordered a set of four books that became known as the [[Libri Carolini]] (i.e. "Charles' books") to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the [[Western Church]], images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.

The [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of [[iconoclasm]]. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen, 2005 ''Theological aesthetics'' {{ISBN|0-8028-2888-4}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but images of God the Father were not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be depicted.{{cn|date=June 2016|reason=this was before the schism between Catholic and Orthodox}}

==Middle ages to the Renaissance==
[[File:God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing.jpg|thumb|240px|''God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing'', with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, [[Girolamo dai Libri]] c. 1555.]]
Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to represent a separate depiction as a full human figure of [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"/&gt; Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the 10th century AD.

It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a delineation of the whole person. Typically only a small part would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person.  In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|baptismal font in Liège]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).  Gradually the amount of the body shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in [[Giotto]]'s [[fresco]] of c. 1305 in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arena Chapel]], at the top of the triumphal arch, ''God sending out the angel of the Annunciation''. See Schiller, I, fig 15&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 14th century the [[Naples Bible]] carried a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the early 15th century, the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] has a considerable number of images, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the [[Garden of Eden]] (gallery), which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress.  The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|"Gates of Paradise" of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 show a similar tall full-length Father.  The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer.  At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''Logos'' in Genesis scenes.  In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].

[[File:Andrea_del_Verrocchio,_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Baptism_of_Christ_-_Uffizi.jpg|thumb|left|Two "''Hands of God''" (relatively unusual) and the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|''Baptism of Christ'', by Verrocchio]], 1472.]]
[[File:Damian. The Ancient of Days.jpg|thumb|''The Ancient of Days'', a 14th-century fresco from [[Ubisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
In an early Venetian school ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' by [[Giovanni d'Alemagna]] and [[Antonio Vivarini]], (c. 1443) (see gallery below) The Father is shown in the representation consistently used by other artists later, namely as a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the description of the [[Ancient of Days]] in the [[Old Testament]], the nearest approach to a physical description of God in the Old Testament:&lt;ref&gt;Bigham Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Annunciation'' by [[Benvenuto di Giovanni]] in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as "hands and dove" continued, e.g. in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's ''Baptism of Christ'']] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' {{ISBN|1-4179-0870-X}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father as an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal tiara, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book. He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the [[Throne of Mercy]] iconography. A dove, the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]] may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian [[Pietà]], God the Father is often shown wearing a papal dress and a papal tiara, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They float in heaven with angels who carry the [[instruments of the Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, 1987 ''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} pages 8 and 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The orb, or the globe of the world, is rarely shown with the other two persons of the Trinity and is almost exclusively restricted to God the Father, but is not a definite indicator since it is sometimes used in depictions of Christ. A book, although often depicted with the Father is not an indicator of the Father and is also used with Christ.&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"/&gt;

==From Renaissance to Baroque==
Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the [[Jansenist]] and [[Baianist]] movements as well as more orthodox theologians.  As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones.  In the [[Western Church]], the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the [[Trinity]] were condemned.  In 1745 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] explicitly supported the [[Throne of Mercy]] depiction, referring to the "Ancient of Days", but in 1786 it was still necessary for [[Pope Pius VI]] to issue a [[papal bull]] condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dividing Light from Darkness.jpg|thumb|302x302px|''[[Separation of Light from Darkness]]'', by [[Michelangelo]], c.first half of 1512.]]
God the Father appears in several Genesis scenes in [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], most famously ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''. God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (see gallery below) in the [[Frari of Venice]], long admired as a masterpiece of [[High Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 ''From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art'' {{ISBN|0-8262-0796-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of [[God the Father]]. In some of these paintings the [[Trinity]] is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but  [[Giovanni Battista Fiammeri]] also depicted God the Father riding on a cloud, above the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin A. Bailey, 2003 ''Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome'' {{ISBN|0-8020-3721-6}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the ''Last Judgment'' and the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' paintings by [[Rubens]] (see gallery below) he depicted God the Father in the form that by then had become widely accepted, as a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray.  In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (whose father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]] was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] both depicted God the Father as a patriarchal figure with a white beard (see gallery below) in a purple robe.

While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the [[Star Chamber]] court in England (except the [[Archbishop of York]]) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote that he considered the depiction of God the Father as an old man "a dangerous act" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, {{ISBN|0559376871}}, 2006 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a "''[[Romish|Romish trend]]''" (a term used to refer to [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]]) that he considered best avoided in England.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Great Moscow Council]] specifically included a ban on a number of depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Tarasov, 2004 ''Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia'' {{ISBN|1-86189-118-0}} page 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genuineorthodoxchurch.com/moscow_1666.htm Orthodox church web site]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the "Ancient of Days" was Christ, as ''Logos'', not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as [[Greece]], [[Romania]], and other Orthodox countries.

'''Gourd art''' involves creating works of [[art]] using ''[[Lagenaria]] spp.'' hard-shell gourds as an art medium. Gourd surfaces may be carved, painted, sanded, burned, dyed, and polished. Typically, a harvested gourd is left to dry over a period of months before the woody surface is suitable for decorating.

Gourd decoration, including [[pyrography]], is an ancient tradition in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] as well as among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], notably the central highland people of [[Peru]], the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Hopi]] and [[Pueblo]] nations of the [[American Southwest]], and the [[Nuxálk Nation|Nuxálk]] and [[Haida people|Haida]] nations of [[British Columbia]]. Gourd crafting and painting has evolved from early hand carvings to the modern day use, by some, of electric wood burners and high-speed pen-shaped rotary tools that can be used to inscribe almost any design. 

A wide variety of gourd shapes and sizes yields an array of art pieces, including: ornaments, bowls, sculpture, vases, and wall art such as masks. Artistic styles can range from craft to fine art. Perhaps the most prolific and successful gourd artist in the United States is Robert Rivera of New Mexico.

The American Gourd Society, headquartered in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], was founded in 1937 and publishes its own [[magazine]]. The Canadian Gourd Society was formed in 1999 and is located in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Both are national nonprofit organizations dedicated to the education and instruction of those interested in gourd history, cultivation, painting, crafts, and participating in competitions. Gourd Art shows and festivals occur in many places throughout [[North America]], the oldest running festival was founded in [[North Carolina]] in 1942. In recent years, [[Internet]] technology has considerably broadened exposure to the art form which in turn has helped generate a marked increase in the number of participants. In North America, gourd art has been the subject of specialty television programs such as ''[[The Carol Duvall Show]]'' on [[Home &amp; Garden Television]]. No longer considered just a [[craft]], gourd art is being elevated to the point where it has been featured in a number of galleries and magazines and exhibited at the [[United States Botanic Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 2003, gourd artists from the United States, [[Australia]], and Canada got together to create the world's first Gourdpatch [[quilt]]. Each artist brought their particular artistic style to a flat 4" × 4" gourd tile which was stitched together to create a quilt.

The '''Hasbro Universe''' is referred to several [[Shared universe|shared]] [[fictional universes]] featuring characters from several franchises owned by [[toy]] company [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Transformers, G.I.

== Comics ==
=== Marvel Comics (1979–2004) ===
Since 1979, [[Marvel Comics]] has published its own comic books based on ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts]]'', ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', set in [[Earth-616]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, the ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'' series were later established non-canon (they set on Earth-91274). Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'' (guest starring the [[X-Men]]) and ''[[New Avengers/Transformers]]'' (guest starring the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to ''Rom'' and ''Micronauts'' have occurred since.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Dreamwave Productions (2004) ===
On 2004, [[Dreamwave Productions]] published ''Transformers/G.I. Joe'', another crossover set in the time of [[World War I]], and including a one-shot titled ''Transformers/G.I. Joe: Divided Front''. This series only lasted six issues, due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== IDW Publishing (2005–present) ===
{{Main|Hasbro Comic Book Universe|Hasbro Reconstruction}}

Between 2005 and 2008, [[IDW Publishing]] acquired the license to make comics based on ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'', but neither have ever shared the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] before. On 2016, IDW announced the [[Hasbro Reconstruction]] branding along with the crossover event ''[[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]]'', which officially set ''[[The Transformers (IDW Publishing)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[G.I. Joe (IDW Publishing)|G.I.

== Television ==
=== Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions (1983–1987) ===
From 1983 to 1987, [[Marvel Productions]] and [[Sunbow Productions]] developed the series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]'' and ''[[Inhumanoids]]''. These series had been hinted to share the same universe, mostly due to the appearance of the character named [[Hector Ramirez (Sunbow)|Hector Ramirez]].{{Citation needed|reason=Ni official link to be|date=December 2016}}

=== ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (2010–2017) ===
The ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (comprising the animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'') features a reference to [[M.A.S.K.]] as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' - Season 3: ''Beast Hunters'' - Episode 5: Project Predacon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' - Season 1 - Episode 17: One of Our Mini-Cons is Missing&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hatchimals''' is a line of robotic toys produced by [[Spin Master]].
== Overview ==
Hatchimals are electronic birds that you can nuture and can hatch from a plastic egg.

Later, in 2017, Hatchimals CollEGGtibles, collectible figurines that you can take out of smaller eggs, was released.

== History ==
It began in 2013, where Spin Master's head of robotic creations [[James Bartin]] explained that his team hated the popularity of [[unboxing]] videos on [[YouTube]], and envisioned a concept for a toy that could "unbox" itself.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt; This idea evolved into a concept for a [[robotic]] creature that would hatch itself from an egg, necessitating the design of a mechanism for the hatching, and a material for the egg itself. Hatchimals was officially launched on October 7, 2016, backed by advertising on television and digital platforms, such as [[social networking service]]s.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Toronto company invented this year's hottest toy: Hatchimals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/how-a-toronto-toy-company-created-hatchimals-and-why-you-cant-find-them/article32932641/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

== Demand ==
Demand for Hatchimals has been extremely high, which have led to them being designated as the "hottest" toy of the 2016 [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]]; in late-October 2016, Hatchimals occupied multiple spots on [[NPD Group]]'s top ten list of best-selling toys in the United States, including first, second, sixth, and ninth place. The firm compared the phenomenon to those surrounding [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] and [[Tickle Me Elmo]]&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;''. [[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' documented the organization of raffles and waiting lists for the toys, and sellers on websites such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]] selling Hatchimals at over three times their suggested retail price of US$60, if not higher.&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/well/family/the-hunt-for-hatchimals-the-elusive-toy-of-the-holiday-season.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin Master was caught off-guard by the unexpected demand; the company originally stated that the toy would appeal primarily to girls aged 6 to 8, but Hatchimals ultimately became popular among boys and older youth audiences as well.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt; The company attempted to address the supply issues by having its remaining stock from China delivered via air freight instead of by ship, but stated that there may not be new stock of Hatchimals until 2017. However, Martin added that the company planned to introduce new species and features to the Hatchimals line, and asked customers to be patient. A California mother sued Spin Master for an egg not hatching because the Hatchimal's batteries were dead.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

[[File:Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece]]

'''''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae''''' is an 1813 publication by the [[botanical illustrator]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]].

Bauer was scientific illustrator on board {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} during [[Matthew Flinders]]' exploration of Australia, and as such he worked closely with the expedition's naturalist, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]. When these men returned to England in 1805, they brought with them thousands of specimens and hundreds of sketches. Initially, they planned to publish a large-scale work, to be entitled ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'', but this venture failed, and Brown decided to publish his scientific descriptions separately, in ''[[Transactions of the Linnean Society of London]]'', and later his own ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]''. Bauer then undertook to publish a lesser work himself, with Brown providing text limited to a brief preface and some captioning.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher=CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually, Bauer not only did all the illustrations, but also engraved the printing plates and hand-coloured the illustrations. It was exceedingly unusual for a single artist to perform all three roles; it is said that Bauer did the engraving himself because he could not find a good engraver, and previous works of his were disappointing because of incompetent engraving.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt;

Three issues of ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'' were published, all in 1813. These three issues totalled fifteen plates, and a sixteenth was bound into some copies. Publication then ceased, probably because the venture was a financial failure.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt; It is estimated that less than fifty copies of the work were sold, and some of these were uncoloured. It is therefore now an extremely rare book. In 1997, a copy was sold at [[Christie's]] for $57,000.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bauer, Ferdinand | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/450 | accessdate = 14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Man of Sorrows''''' is a small  [[Early Netherlandish]] oil on wood panel painting completed c. 1485-1495. It is attributed to [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] and in the tradition of the devotional images of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which typically show Christ before his crucifixion, naked above the waist, bearing the wounds of his [[passion of Jesus|Passion]]. The panel has an unusually complex and suffocating spatial design, and depicts the [[mocking of Jesus]], and his [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|grieving mother]].&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire; Rosen, 348&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is steeped in both complex iconography and deep pathos. Christ is in obvious pain and holds his wounds up for the viewer. He looks out while  white robed weeping angels bear the [[Arma Christi]] -objects associated with his crucifixion and death- float around him. The attending saints include Mary and the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]].

''Man of Sorrows'' has been described as "one of the most moving...in Early Netherlandish art", and is usually considered a highly emotive and sorrowful work, especially in its description of Christ's  pitiful, almost defeated expression and blood-run face.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about the lost right hand panel; it may have contained another religious scene or a [[donor portrait]].&lt;ref name="R150" /&gt; It is housed in the [[Museum Catharijneconvent]], [[Utrecht]].

==Devotional type==
[[File:Israhel van Meckenem the Younger - Man in sorrow - WGA14734.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Israhel van Meckenem the Younger]], ''Vera icon'', engraving, c. 1490. [[Staatliche Museen, Berlin]]]]
The panel is in the tradition of the iconic devotional image of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which developed in Europe from the 13th century, and was especially popular in Northern Europe. The phrase, in the passages of [[Isaiah 53]] (''[[Servant songs]]'') in the [[Hebrew Bible]], translates into English as "Man of Sorrows" ("vir dolorum" in the [[Vulgate]]):
&lt;small&gt;

3) He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.  

4) Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 

5) But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.

6) All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=53&amp;version=48 |title=21st Century King James Version |work=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

In such works the viewer is asked to stand before the wounded and maimed, half naked body of Christ, and contemplate and contemplate and take responsibility for his sufferings.&lt;ref name="d69"&gt;Decker (2008), 69&lt;/ref&gt; Geertgen's depiction differs from previous iconographical depictions in that Christ's head is raised, and he looks directly at the viewer.&lt;ref name="d63"&gt;Decker (2008), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Geertgen Man van smarten (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with angel overcome by grief]]
Christ stands in his tomb, a stone [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; His entire body is lacerated and deformed by wounds sustained during his [[Flagellation of Christ|flogging]].&lt;ref name="d61"&gt;Decker (2008), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he not clearly dead, as in earlier depictions. His eyes stare directly at the viewer, a device identified by the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] as referring to the biblical text "Behold what I have suffered for you; what have you suffered for me".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1953), 124&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was earlier identified by art historian [[Alois Riegl]] as evoking an "external unity" where Christ's gaze becomes one with the viewer's world.&lt;ref name="R153"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 153&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Wouter Slob writes that Christ's expression "confronts the contemporary viewer with the consequences of ''His'' sinning; the blood, splashing from the panel, flows because of his guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Slob, 40&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite Christ's apparent agony, his animated, half-standing, half-kneeling pose in his sarcophagus seems to reference his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. He may be equally descending into or our the tomb.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

To his left, [[Mary Magdalene]] kneels in prayer. Her arms rest on the sarcophagus, her eyes are downcast, her plaintive expression is a study of grief. At the foot of the cross, Jesus' [[Mary, mother of Jesus|mother, Mary]], laments with arms folded, as large drops of tears pour down her face.&lt;ref name="S29" /&gt; She is supported by [[John the Evangelist]] with only his head and hands visible, wiping his tears with the back of his hand.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A motif borrowed from [[Robert Campin]]'s ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]''. See Barasch, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Angels dressed in white robes, their eyes swollen with tears, carry the remaining [[Arma Christi]], including the lance, [[Holy Sponge]] and the [[Nail (relic)|three nails from the cross]].&lt;ref name="b22"&gt;Bara, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
===Mourners===
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Detail of [[Mary Magdalene]]]]
A number of saints and angels are openly weeping, imbuing the Passion with very human qualities, and expressive of emotional turmoil.&lt;ref name="b26"&gt;Barasch, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the employment of tears is reflective of Geertgen's tendency towards emotionalism, but may also have been to intended to invoke [[contrition]], forcing the viewer to view Christ's sufferings individual terms, and reflect on their own [[original sin|culpability]]. Church theology of the time encouraged compassion for Christ's suffering, while emphasising that mankind was the source of his torments. According to art historian John Decker, medieval "sermons and devotional tracts encouraged the faithful to study the broken body of Christ, to tally his wounds, and to bear always in mind that humankind's various sins caused each injury."&lt;ref name="d68"&gt;Decker (2008), 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The scene allowed viewers "opportunities to interact empathetically with sacred history"; and encouraged [[contrition]] and [[penitence]],&lt;ref name="d65"&gt;Decker (2008), 65&lt;/ref&gt; an approach reflected in works by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], later adopted by Geertgen.&lt;ref name="d59-63"&gt;Decker (2008), 59-63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail2.jpg|400px|thumb|Detail showing [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], with a tear on her cheek]]
The use of tears to denote grief was probably derived from Rogier, who fascinated by tears, refined a subtle formula for the depiction of crying,&lt;ref name="b22" /&gt; as can be seen especially his Madrid ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' of c. 1435.&lt;ref name="b27"&gt;Barasch, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary has a large tear pouring down her cheek, which art historian Moshe Barasch describes as "painted with subtle shadows to give it material substance, with reflections and a highlight to make it transparent and shiny", and compares its rendering to that of jewelry or glass.&lt;ref name="b26" /&gt;

In some instances the tears are implied by a hand gesture rather than actually shown. This is again influenced by Rogier's ''Descent'', but originates from Campin's ''Entombment'', where a figure is implied to be crying by the fact that he wipes his face with the back of his hand, a technique Rogier borrowed and perfected some 20 years later.&lt;ref name="b23"&gt;Barasch, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crucifixion===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Deposition (detail) - WGA25578.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Detail from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The panel shows Christs tortured body at his resting place on [[Calvary]], still carrying the torment of his [[True Cross|wooden cross]], his knees buckling from its weight.&lt;ref name="R152"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 152&lt;/ref&gt; The painting contains many symbols of his Passion.&lt;ref name="d59"&gt;Decker (2008), 59&lt;/ref&gt; He wears the [[Crown of Thorns]]; its spikes spill blood across his face. His arms are heavily lacerated by what appear to be [[Scourging of Jesus|whip marks]], and he weakly raises his right hand to display the deep [[Five Holy Wounds|wound]] to his side, where according to [[Bible|scripture]], he was pierced by a [[Holy Lance|lance]] after his death on the cross.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; In 1927, Panofsky identified the panel in the tradition of iconic devotional depictions (''[[andachtsbilder]]'') of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", noting especially its focus on the sacrificial aspect of the Passion and the its unflinching, yet emotive depiction of physical suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some respects the work is unsophisticated; composed mainly from simplified geometric forms, while there is not much differentiation in the oval, idealised faces of the female figures. The clothes of any of the figures are not especially detailed; their volume and texture only suggested by the heavy folds.&lt;ref name="R152" /&gt; However, it is highly regarded for its complex and innovative composition, with many of the elements presented at oblique angles. It is very tightly cropped, for the era it was produced, cutting off the Magdalene and Evangelist would have been considered daring.&lt;ref name="R150"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
[[File:Triptych-with-the-entombment-of-christ-1822 (detail).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Robert Campin]], ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]'', c. 1410-15. [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London]] 
The work is attributed to Geertgen tot Sint Jans mainly for its typically simplified geometric shapes, and similarity to his ''The Lamentation of Christ''; a painting in which the faces and expressions of Mary and John bear striking similarity to the present work. The attribution was accepted by both Friedländer and Panofsky. Especially Panofsky was enthusiastic about the panel, but Friedländer did not hold it in high regard. He praised the description of the Virgin, especially her face and hands, and described the depiction of the Magdalene as "realistic...with such carefully observed shadows" and "among the masters best work". However he found the figure of Christ to be "traditional", and wrote that the "absence of spatial elaboration overall is felt to be all the more vexing". Overall the image, he believed, lacked depth of field and compositional balance.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Panofsky, although he generally admired Friedländer's analysis, disagreed strongly, and in a 1927 treatise on Netherlandish depictions of the "Man of Sorrows" wrote, "As, however, all the seemingly haphazard composition lines lead with compelling force to the face of the Savior, which, lifted out of the image, focuses its large, tearful eye on us, the sum of all the sorrows which he suffers, and all of the mourning that is suffered for him, now appears to besiege us."&lt;ref name="R153" /&gt;

==Provenance==
Nothing is record of the panel's commission or early owners.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;  Given the remnants of hinges on its frame, the work probably formed the left hand side of a diptych of which the opposite panel is now lost, possibly split up during the 18th century when composite works of this era were out of fashion and were broken up to be sold as individual easel pictures. The ''Man of Sorrows'' is thought to have been created as part of a series of small paintings for the [[Haarlem]] [[Janskerk (Haarlem)|Commandery of the Knights of St John]], a group of works that explore a range of human emotions.&lt;ref name="S29"&gt;Smith, 129&lt;/ref&gt; That group of paintings originally hung in the organisation's Church of St. John in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

'''Peter Halley''' (born September 24, 1953) is an American artist and a central figure in the [[Neo-Conceptualist]] movement of the 1980s. Known for his Day-Glo geometric paintings, Halley is also regarded as a writer, the former publisher of ''[[index Magazine]]'', and a teacher, having served as Director of Graduate Studies in Painting and Printmaking at the [[Yale University School of Art]] from 2002 to 2011. Halley lives and works in New York City.

==Introduction==
Halley is an American painter. He came to prominence as an artist in the mid-1980s, as part of the generation of [[Neo-Conceptualist]] artists that first exhibited in New York’s East Village, including [[Jeff Koons]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Annette Lemieux]], [[Steven Parrino]], Phillip Taaffe, [[Gretchen Bender]], and Meyer Vaisman. Halley's paintings explore both the physical and psychological structures of social space; he connects the hermetic language of geometric abstraction—influenced by artists such as [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]—to the actualities of urban space and the digital landscape. In the 1990s, he expanded his practice to include installations based around the technology of large-scale digital prints.

Halley is also known for his critical writings, which, beginning in the 1980s, linked the ideas of French [[Post-Structuralist]] theorists such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] to the digital revolution and the visual arts. From 1996 to 2005, Halley published ''[[Index Magazine]]'', which featured in-depth interviews with emergent and established figures in fashion, music, film, and other creative fields. Having also taught art in several graduate programs, Halley became the Director of Graduate Studies in Painting and Printmaking at the [[Yale University School of Art]], serving from 2002 to 2011. 

===Early life and education===
Halley was born and raised in New York City. He is the son of Janice Halley, a registered nurse of Polish ancestry, and [[Rudolph Halley]], an attorney and politician of German-Austrian Jewish descent. In 1951, Rudolph “became an instant celebrity,” as Halley has said, while serving as chief prosecutor for the [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce]], also known as the Kefauver Committee (after Senator Estes Kefauver). “This series of hearings with various colorful mobsters was broadcast on television all over the country,” Halley notes.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Katherine Hixson, “Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolph was also assistant counsel to the wartime [[Truman Committee]], investigating fraud and waste in defense contracting. He served as president of the New York City Council from 1951 to 1953, and ran for New York City Mayor in 1953. He passed away soon after at the age of forty-three, when Halley was three years old.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Katherine Hixson, “Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, “Between Neo- and Post-,” The New Yorker, 24 Nov 1986, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable family members include Rudolph’s first cousin [[Carl Solomon]] (1928-1993), to whom [[Allen Ginsberg]] dedicated his epic poem "[[Howl]] (for Carl Solomon)" in 1955. The Halleys are also related to Samuel Shipman (1884-1937), a well-known and colorful writer of Broadway comedies in the 1920s. Halley's great aunt and uncle, Rose and [[A.A. Wyn]], published [[Ace Comics]] from 1940 to 1956 and [[Ace Books]] from 1952 to 1973. Ace Books was an American publisher of science fiction that published [[William Burroughs]]’s first novel, ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'', in 1953, as well as the first novels by several prominent science-fiction writers including [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Katherine Hixson, “Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A precocious child, Peter started first grade at Manhattan's Hunter College Elementary School at the age of 6. He later attended [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts, a prep school known for its art museum and, at the time, innovative art program. While at Andover, Halley took an interest in various forms of media and became the programming director for the school’s low-wattage radio station. It was also during this time that he began painting, making his first works in his great uncle Aaron’s art studio.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, “Between Neo- and Post-,” The New Yorker, 24 Nov 1986, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received college acceptances with full scholarships from Brown, Harvard, and Yale, but chose to study at Yale because of their renowned art program.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Katherine Hixson, “Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; But, after his sophomore year, Halley was denied entry into the art major and decided to move to New Orleans, where he lived for one year. He returned to Yale the following year to study art history, and wrote his senior thesis on [[Henri Matisse]] before graduating in 1975. After graduation, Halley returned to New Orleans and, in 1976, enrolled in the University of New Orleans MFA program. He received his MFA in 1978 and lived in New Orleans until 1980 (also traveling to Mexico, Central America, Europe, and North Africa during this time).&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career and New York City===
In 1980, Halley returned to New York City and moved into a loft on East 7th Street in the East Village, Manhattan; there, [[Talking Heads]] frontman [[David Byrne]] was his upstairs neighbor. New York City had a lasting influence on Halley’s distinct painting style. He became enamored with the city's intensity, scale, and three-dimensional urban grid—the “geometricization of space that pervaded the 20th century.” Likewise interested in abstract painting, Halley “set out to connect the language of geometric abstraction to the actual space that he saw all around him, transforming the square—borrowed from [[Malevich]], [[Albers]], and others—into architectural icons he called ‘prisons’ and ‘cells,’ and connecting them by straight lines called ‘conduits.’”&lt;ref&gt;This Will Have Been: Art, Love &amp; Politics in the 1980s, exhibition catalogue (Chicago: Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

These particular geometric icons, which he developed in the early 1980s in the midst of a global technology boom, became the basis of Halley’s painting for the decades to come. Halley derived his language not just from the urban grid but from the gridded networks permeating all facets of the contemporary “media-controlled, post-industrial world.” With this background, the "cells" could be seen as “images of confinement and as cellular units in the scientific sense,” according to [[Calvin Tomkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, “Between Neo- and Post-,” The New Yorker, 24 Nov 1986, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The “conduits”—the lines connect various “cells” and other geometric patterns in a given work—represent the supports of “underlying informational and structural components of contemporary society,” Amy Brandt writes.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; “Halley wished to incite public awareness of the confining, underlying structures of industrialized society and commodity capitalism.”&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to urban structures such as modernist buildings and subways, Halley drew influence from the pop themes and social issues associated with [[New Wave music]].&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, “Between Neo- and Post-,” The New Yorker, 24 Nov 1986, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Siegel, "The Artist/Critic of the Eighties: Peter Halley and Stephen Westfall,” Arts Magazine (Sep 1985): 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the modernist grid of previous abstract painting—namely, according to Brandt, the work of [[Frank Stella]]—and amplified its colors and impact in accordance with the postmodern times. During this early period, Halley employed new colors and materials with specific connotations. He began to use fluorescent Day-Glo paint, which has an uncanny glow that recalls the artificial lights of postmodern society and the bright government-issued signs that mark streets and workers’ clothing. Halley also uses Day-Glo colors in response to developments in modernist painting—a “hyperrealization” of art-historical motifs, in Halley terms (following Jean Baudrillard)—and as a means of delineating space on his canvases.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 155, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley also began to employ Roll-a-Tex, a textural additive that gives his “cells” and “prisons” a tactile, architectural quality, as Roll-a-Tex is most often used as surfacing in buildings such as suburban homes and motels.&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern, commodity-like color and texture, not to mention the thickness, of Halley’s canvases entered them into the art-historical conversation surrounding painting and objecthood. The mixture of harsh colors and textures at once “seduce[s] and repel[s] viewers with assaults on their senses of sight and touch.”&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 151, 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Katherine Hixson, “Peter Halley: Oeuvres de 1982 à 1991” exhibition catalogue, Bordeaux: CAPC, Musee d'Art Contemporain, 1991, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Halley's practice and career developed amid the artistic and intellectual discourse that arose in East Village artist-run galleries like International with Monument, Cash/Newhouse, and Nature Morte. These spaces were a community for artists such as Halley, Jeff Koons, Haim Steinbach, Sherrie Levine, [[Ashley Bickerton]], and [[Richard Prince]], who “shared a focus on the role of technology in postmodern society and rejected nature as a touchstone of meaning.” (Bob Nickas, Dan Cameron, and the curatorial team Tricia Collins and [[Richard Milazzo]] were curators and critics associated with this scene.)&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Carrier, “Baudrillard as Philosopher, or, The End of Abstract Painting,” Arts Magazine (Sep 1988): 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;These artists used irony and pastiche to subvert and comment upon structural issues of the time; they drew from Conceptual Art to create “paintings and sculptures that operated as a set of pictorial signs referencing artists and moments in postwar art history,” expanding their boundaries as artists to also encompass the theoretical discourse around the art objects themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley staged solo projects at PS122 Gallery in 1980 and at the East Village bar Beulah Land in 1984. In 1983 he organized a show at the John Weber Gallery, ''Science Fiction'', which included, among others, Jeff Koons as well as Ross Bleckner, Richard Prince, Taro Suzuki, Robert Smithson, and [[Donald Judd]], the latter of whom had been an influence on Halley. Alison Pearlman described the relevance and influence of the show, writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gallery presentation dramatized a pop-futuristic sensibility. To begin, the space was painted entirely black. Because many of the works incorporated geometric shapes, Plexiglas and lights, some flashing or rotating, the total effect was crystalline like a ''Star Trek'' idea of Peter Halley, Jeff Koons, and the Art at Marketing… This high-tech sensibility has been common in popular science fiction as well as fashion, music, and other consumer products made to look geometricizing, streamlined, synthetic, or otherwise ultra-urban. The aesthetic coincides with actual fashions of the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, Unpackaging Art of the 1980s (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2003), 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Halley’s first larger one-person exhibition came in 1985 at International with Monument, a gallery at the heart of the East Village scene run by [[Meyer Vaisman]], Kent Klamen, and Elizabeth Koury, who had all met at the [[Parsons School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;Cara Jordan, Peter Halley, “Introduction,” Stuart Shave Modern Art, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Halley introduced Jeff Koons to Vaisman, and Koons subsequently exhibited at International with Monument as well.

In October 1986, Vaisman organized a group show at New York's more established [[Sonnabend Gallery]] that featured work by Halley, [[Ashley Bickerton]], Jeff Koons, and Vaisman himself. Embodying the intellectual style that had been established by International with Monument, the show marked a departure from the painterly style of [[Neo-Expressionism]], the dominant style in New York’s art scene of the earlier 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Taylor, “The Hot Four,” New York Magazine, 27 Oct 1986, 50–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition at Sonnabend received popular and critical attention, and the four artists became identified on a wider scale with the labels “Neo-Geo” and “[[Neo-Conceptualism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Larson, “Masters of Hype,” New York Magazine, 10 Nov 1986, 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York (magazine)|New York]] magazine Kay Larson called the artists "Masters of Hype," while in the same magazine a month earlier, Paul Taylor had dubbed them “The Hot Four” and called Halley the “intellectual of the group.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Taylor, “The Hot Four,” New York Magazine, 27 Oct 1986, 50–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay Larson, “Masters of Hype,” New York Magazine, 10 Nov 1986, 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta Smith wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "Halley's geometric abstractions suggest diagrams of battery cells with conduits or prison cells with barred windows (that is, electrical or social systems), while their powerful fluorescent colors come from somewhere beyond art."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Smith, “Four Young East Villagers at Sonnabend Gallery,” The New York Times, 28 Oct 1986, C30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
As he began his art career, Halley became interested in the French Post-Structuralist writers, including [[Michel Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Paul Virilio]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]], many of whose works were translated into English in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were being discussed among New York intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Milazzo, Selected Essays: 1982-2001, “Introduction,” Edgewise Press: New York, 2013. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, 1985; Stuart Sim, Fifty Key Postmodern Thinkers (New York: Routledge, 2013), 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of the French writers informed Halley's use of synthetic colors and materials in his painting, and also the writing that he began to produce around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brandt, Interplay: Neoconceptual Art of the 1980s (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2014), 151, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; “The modernism I grew up with was that it was spiritual,” Halley said, “it was about a kind of purity and Emersonian transcendentalism… Feeling less and less comfortable with that, I decided that for me modernism was really about skepticism, doubt, and questioning. Things that we now say are part of a postmodern sensibility.”&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rosenthal, Abstraction in the Twentieth Century, Guggenheim Museum: New York, 1996. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley put forth such ideas on modernism, postmodernism, culture, and the digital revolution—derived in part from Foucault, Baudrillard, and others, and with a neo-Marxist slant—in his numerous writings.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, “Non-representation in 1988: Meaning Production Beyond the Scope of the Pious,” Arts Magazine (May 1988): 30–39.&lt;/ref&gt; He published his first essay “Beat, Minimalism, New Wave, and Robert Smithson” in 1981 in ''[[Arts Magazine]]'', a New York-based publication that published seven more of his essays throughout that decade.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Milazzo, Selected Essays: 1982-2001, “Introduction,” Edgewise Press: New York, 2013. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essays, published from the 1980s to early 2000s, Halley makes reference to the shifting relationship between the individual and larger social structures, and how artists of his generation responded to the emerging social, economic, and cultural conditions of the 1980s and 1990s.  Halley highlighted the various roles of New Wave music, Cold War cultural politics, and the increased digitization of experience brought about by computers and video games. Additionally, he provided a critical overview of contemporary art during this period through examining a range of sources including the social theories of [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Norbert Elias]], and [[Richard Sennett]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Milazzo, Selected Essays: 1982-2001, “Introduction,” Edgewise Press: New York, 2013. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, Unpackaging Art of the 1980s (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2003), 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Halley’s writings were anthologized in ''Collected Essays 1981-1987'', published by Galerie [[Bruno Bischofberger]] in Zurich. In 1997, a second anthology, ''Recent Essays 1990-1996'', edited by Richard Milazzo, was published by Edgewise Press. Milazzo’s updated book, ''Peter Halley: Selected Essays 1981-2001'', was published by Edgewise in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Selected Essays: 1982-2001, “Introduction,” Edgewise Press: New York, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artwork from the 1990s to the present===
Following the 1986 exhibition at Sonnabend Gallery, Halley had many more exhibitions in Europe and the United States, including his first museum survey, ''Peter Halley: Recent Paintings,'' at the Museum Haus Esters in Krefeld, Germany, in 1989. In 1991-1992, CAPC Musee d'Art Contemporain, Bordeaux, staged an extensive retrospective of Halley’s work that traveled to FAE Musee d’art Contemporain, Lausanne, Switzerland; the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia]], Madrid; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Halley: Recent Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Krefelder Kunstmuseen, Museum Haus Esters, Krefeld, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Halley: Works from 1982–1991, exhibition catalogue, CAPC Musée d'art contemporain, Bordeaux, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, in response to the changes in communications and media caused by the digital revolution, Halley adapted his visual language to the effects of the digital revolution in the 1990s. &lt;ref&gt;Pariss Sloan, “Pleasure and Alienation,” Tirade Magazine, Issue 3, (Apr 2014): 10–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The “conduits” that marked his painting began to multiply and increase in complexity, and he began to add pearlescent and metallic paints to his Day-Glo color palette of the 1980s. “My earlier paintings were rational, diagrammatic, and logical,” he said in a 1995 interview with [[Flash Art]], explaining the difference between his ’80s and subsequent outputs. “Then I made a break around 1990, and since then they’ve become really exaggerated, almost parodic; and they aren’t analytical at all. In any case, I don’t see a great formal break in the ’90s, although there is a psychological break.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Rian, “Peter Halley Makes a Move,” Flash Art (Oct 1995): 89–92,128.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990 Halley began producing bas-reliefs, many of them hollow and constructed from fiberglass.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, Unpackaging Art of the 1980s (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2003), 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he began experimenting with digital printing and web-based art.

In 1993, Halley created ''Superdream Mutation'', a digital print available for viewing and downloading on the web bulletin board-style platform The Thing. The piece, a monochrome image, was distributed as a GIF—and is considered to be the first artwork exclusively available for online viewing and sale (for twenty dollars).&lt;ref&gt;David Platzker and Elizabeth Wyckoff, Hard Pressed: 600 Years of Prints and Process, Hudson Hills: New York, 2000. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this work, Halley highlighted his thought process and the way in which the digital work related to his painting: “I set up the matrix and the person has certain choices within it. It's also based on a Jasper Johns print edition from the mid-sixties, in which there was a line drawing of a target, and a little box of water colors. It was a kit. Another factor for the Web project was my skepticism about the notion of ‘interactivity’ on the computer. Most decisions are choices between two paths; binary decisions are the only possible ones with computers. So I wanted to do something in which the choices were very mechanistic.”&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tribe, “Peter Halley, On Line______” Rhizome, http://rhizome.org/discuss/28280, 4 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Halley did another online project called ''Exploding Cell'' with the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, on the occasion of his 1997 exhibition ''New Concepts in Printmaking 1: Peter Halley'', a one-person show that highlighted Halley's print and installation practices. ''Exploding Cell'' was published online at the time and is still available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/interactives/projects/1997/Halley/&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Lowry, director of the museum, has stated that this was MoMA’s first digital acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;“Glenn Lowry with Joachim Pissarro, Gaby Collins-Fernandez, and David Carrier,” The Brooklyn Rail, 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the twenty-first century, Halley has continued to employ his iconic “cells,” “prisons” and “conduits” in his painting, as his primary subject remains the organization of social space. But, Halley explained in 2011, “the nature of the social space we live in has changed immensely in the last thirty years since my project began. When I started my work in the ’80s, the limits of communications technology were the telephone, the fax machine, and cable television. In a very short time, we’ve gone from the era of limited, linear communications to the epoch of the web, Google, and Facebook.”&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley has continued to exhibit internationally, including in New York at Mary Boone Gallery (2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013); in Cologne at Jablonka Gallery (1988, 1990, 1993, 1998); in Zurich at Galerie Bruno Bischofberger (1988, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1998); in Paris at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac (1992, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007); in Brescia at Galleria Massimo Minini (1997, 2000, 2008, 2012); in London at Waddington Galleries (1999, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2013); and in many other cities around the world. In 2016, he staged an installation with Galerie Thomas, Munich, at Art Unlimited at Art Basel. As of 2016, Halley is represented by Greene Naftali Gallery in New York and Stuart Shave Modern Art in London.

===Digital prints and installations===
In the mid-1990s, Halley began implementing digital software as a means of developing his compositions. He also began to explore printmaking, using a variety of techniques including silkscreen, digital, and inkjet printing. In his prints, Halley often includes comic book imagery as well as a new motif of explosions and exploding cells, often made through printing images from the computer and auto-tracing them.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Rian, “Peter Halley Makes a Move,” Flash Art (Oct 1995): 89–92,128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Princenthal, “Peter Halley at the Museum of Modern Art,” Art in America (May 1998): 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s, Halley started to produce site-specific installations for museums, galleries, and public spaces that would interact with the surrounding architecture. His installations mix imagery and media such as painting, fiberglass relief sculpture, wall-size flowcharts, and digitally generated wallpaper. Halley created his first site-specific installation at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]]; this installation included paintings, silkscreen prints, wallpaper, and murals of flow charts and other images. The flow charts had entered Halley’s lexicon around 1994 as both elements of paintings and as independent works; they are “readymade models from textbooks and manuals and other such sources of hierarchies or processes of various kinds, from business hierarchies and divisions of labor to psychological and sociological theories of human relationships and behavior to commodity-production processes.”&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, Unpackaging Art of the 1980s (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2003), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his new approach, specifically the implementation of flow charts on the walls, Halley said: &lt;blockquote&gt;When I was planning to include them [flow charts] in my Dallas show some people said that it would be too didactic to put a flow chart next to a painting to show the connections between them. But I use flow charts that are as opaque as possible; in other words there is no specific information. In fact, they make no sense without their captions. What happened in Dallas was that viewers first looked at the flowcharts, then they looked at the paintings. I think it was a way of giving the average person information about the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Rian, “Peter Halley Makes a Move,” Flash Art (Oct 1995): 89–92,128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other notable installations include at [[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, in 1999, and [[Disjecta]], Portland, in 2012, as well as “Judgment Day,” an installation of digital prints for the exhibition, Personal Structures, at the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Halley: Recent Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Krefelder Kunstmuseen, Museum Haus Esters, Krefeld, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://artdaily.com/news/48434/Peter-Halley--Judgment-Day---An-Installation-in-Personal-Structures-at-the-Venice-Biennale#.WG6Kk7YrK-o&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, he exhibited ''The Schirn Ring'', a large, multi-part installation at Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Lewis, “Wander About an Art Installation Inspired by the Large Hadron Collider,” Smithsonian (Online edition), www.smithsonian.com, 16 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley has created several permanent works in public spaces. In 2005, he was commissioned to make a 17-by-40 foot painting consisting of a grid of eight individual panels, for the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dfwairport.com/art/P1_017299.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Michlin, “The Art of Flying,” American Way, Fort Worth, TX, 15 Jul 2005, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 2008, he completed a permanent installation of digital prints extending over five floors for the [[Gallatin School of Individualized Study]] at New York University.

Halley’s longstanding interest in design has led to collaborative installations with international designers, creating a compelling dialogue between fine art and design. In 2007 he collaborated with French designer Matali Crasset on an installation at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris, France; and with Italian architect [[Alessandro Mendini]] at Galleria Massimo Minini, Brescia, Italy, and at [[Mary Boone Gallery]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bates, “Matali Crasset,” Icon Eye (Nov 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Index Magazine''==
{{Main|Index Magazine}}

In 1996, Halley and Bob Nickas, a curator and writer, co-founded ''index'', a magazine inspired by Andy Warhol’s ''Interview'' that featured interviews with people in various creative fields. Halley ran index from his New York studio. The magazine often employed rising photographers like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Ryan McGinley]], and ran interviews with artists of diverse media like [[Björk]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Agnes b.]], [[Diamanda Galas]], [[Harmony Korine]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. Halley stopped production of ''index'' in 2005. In 2014, [[Rizzoli (publisher)|Rizzoli]] published ''Index A to Z: Art, Design, Fashion, Film, and Music in the Indie Era'', which documents the magazine's run as well as that era's cultural movements.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, Unpackaging Art of the 1980s (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2003), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Halley has taught and lectured at universities continuously throughout his career, both in the United States and abroad. In the early 2000s, Halley was an active teacher in the graduate art programs at Columbia University, UCLA, and Yale University. In 2002, he became director of the Graduate Painting and Printmaking program at the Yale School of Art, where he served until 2011.  From 2010 to 2011, he was appointed as an endowed chair, the Leffingwell Professor of Painting, at the Yale University School of Art. Halley’s prominent students include artists Mary Reid Kelly, Tala Madani, [[Keltie Ferris]], Matt Connors, Ella Kruglyanskala, Anna Betbeze, Sacha Braunig, Ahmed Alsoudani, Njideka Akununyili Crosby, Abigail Deville, Jennifer Packer, and (from the Columbia MFA program) Dana Schutz.&lt;ref&gt;“Peter Halley” exhibition catalogue, Galerie Thomas Munich, 2011, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale News, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Life==
Halley is married to the painter Ann Craven. He has two children, Isabel and Thomas, from a previous marriage to Caroline Stewart.

'''Phamaly Theatre Company''' (formerly the '''Physically Handicapped Actors &amp; Musical Artists League''' or '''PHAMALy'''), also known as just '''Phamaly''' (as in "family"), is a theater group and touring company based in [[Denver, Colorado]] formed entirely of people with disabilities from across the spectrum.{{r|Moore-2015}} Phamaly was founded in 1989 by a group of former students of the Boettcher School, a now-closed school for the disabled.{{r|ACA}} The students were frustrated with the lack of theatrical opportunities for people with disabilities and wanted to create a theatre company that provided those individuals with the opportunity to perform.{{r|about}} Phamaly Theatre Company performs primarily at the [[Denver Performing Arts Complex]] and the Aurora Fox Theatre.{{r|where}}  The company's season also includes various touring and educational shows. Its recent seasons have seen productions tour outside the state of Colorado into neighboring Wyoming as well as [[Osaka, Japan]].{{r|Moore-2015}}

==Recognition==
Phamaly Theatre Company has gained national attention and has received numerous local awards, including the Mayor's Award for Excellence in the Arts{{r|AVD}} and Theatre Company of the Year from [[5280 Magazine]] and the Alliance for Colorado Theatre.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2016}} Phamaly's 2005 production was awarded two Ovation Awards from the [[Denver Post]], including Best Musical and Best Director, was recognized by the [[Rocky Mountain News]] as one of ten best productions of the year, and was named top overall show by the [[Boulder Daily Camera]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2016}} At the 2008 [[Henry Awards]] (Denver's version of the [[Tony Award|Tonys]]),{{r|Flomberg-2015}} Phamaly won four awards with ''Urinetown, the Musical'', for Outstanding Actress in a Musical (Juliet Villa), Outstanding Lighting Design (Stephen D. Mazzeno), Outstanding Choreography (Debbie Stark, Cindy Bray) and Outstanding Direction of a Musical (Steve Wilson).{{r|Calhoun-2008}}

On August 29, 2006, Phamaly was featured in a lengthy segment of ''[[The News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].{{r|Bowser-2006}} This marked the company's first mainstream national publicity. Previous to that, Phamaly is also the subject of a documentary short entitled ''We Are PHAMALY'' directed by [[Daniel Junge]].{{r|Crosetto-Garcha-Horan-2009}} Long-time company member Mark Dissette made a feature-length documentary, ''There's Still Hope for Dreams (A PHAMALy Story)'' (2008).{{r|DFS}}

Phamaly was honored to receive grants for community impact from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 2013 and 2014.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2016}}

==Productions==
Phamaly performs a musical every summer, usually in the Space Theatre at the [[Denver Performing Arts Complex]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2016}}

In January 2007, the company opened the first non-musical production in its history at the Aurora Fox Theatre on historic [[Colfax Avenue]].  The company has performed at the Aurora Fox every winter since. In 2011 it expanded to the [[Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities]] as well.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2016}}

Since the fall of 2008, Phamaly has also produced a series of sketch comedy productions entitled ''Vox Phamalia''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">'''Philosophy of design''' is the study of assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[design]].  The field is defined by an interest in a set of problems, or an interest in central or foundational concerns in design.  In addition to these central problems for design as a whole, many philosophers of design consider these problems as they apply to particular disciplines (e.g. [[philosophy of art]]).  Although most practitioners are [[philosopher]]s, several prominent [[designer]]s and [[artist]]s have contributed to the field. For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/en/cephad/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

{{History of Turkish literature}}
Roughly speaking, the '''prose of the Ottoman Empire''' can be divided along the lines of two broad periods: early Ottoman prose, written prior to the 19th century CE and exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature; and later Ottoman prose, which extended from the mid-19th century [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat period]] of reform to the final fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1922, and in which prose [[fiction]] was first introduced.

==Early Ottoman prose==
Early Ottoman prose, before the 19th century CE, never developed to the extent that the contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose of the time was expected to adhere to the rules of ''[[seci]]'', or [[rhymed prose]], a type of writing descended from Arabic literature (''[[saj']]'') and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]].

Nevertheless, there was a long tradition of prose in the Ottoman Empire. This tradition was, for centuries, exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature—the [[fiction]] tradition was limited to narrative poetry. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:
* the ''seyahâtnâme'', or [[Travel literature|travelogue]], of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century ''[[Seyahatname|Seyahâtnâme]]'' of [[Evliya Çelebi]]
* the ''sefâretnâme'', a related genre that is a sort of travelogue of the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman [[ambassador]], and which is best exemplified by the 1718–1720 ''Paris Sefâretnâmesi'' of Yirmisekiz Mehmet Çelebi Efendi, ambassador to the court of [[Louis XV of France]]
* the ''siyâsetnâme'', a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century ''[[Siyasatnama|Siyāsatnāma]]'', written in Persian by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], [[vizier]] to the Seljuk rulers [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malik Shah I]]
* the ''tezkire'', a collection of short [[Biography|biographies]] of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century ''tezkiretü'ş-şuara''s, or biographies of poets, by Latîfî and [[Aşık Çelebi]]
* the ''münşeât'', a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of ''[[belles-lettres]]''
* the ''münazara'', a collection of [[debate]]s of either a religious or a philosophical nature

'''Sam Ely and Lynn Harris''' are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as [[Per Hüttner]], [[Lisa Lefeuvre]], [[Apolonija Šušteršič]], Simon Morris, [[Dallas Seitz]] and [[Denise Hawyrsio]]. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations. They are currently developing volume 4 for their online research/curatorial project [[Unrealised Projects]].&lt;ref&gt;Jablonskiene, Lolita, October 2008, Printed Project, Issue 10, 'The Art of Living with Strangers', p132, ISSN 1649-4075.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism''''' was an exhibition curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48720&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, through bringing about a hundred works each of four modern Indian artists, namely [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] on the centre stage, put the Santiniketan art movement into focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1418/14180690.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar argues that the "Santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style, and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique. Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual modernism==
The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition "Place for People"—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian Kumar’s exhibition and related publication, ''A Contextual Modernism'', focused on the [[Santiniketan]] artists [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. Of the Santiniketan artists, Kumar observed that they "reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kumar "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual modernism and the Bengal School of Art==
{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kumar had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 1980s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was misleading. According to Kumar, "this happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiniketan: art movement and school==
{{History of art sidebar}}
Kumar draws distinction between ''Santiniketan the art movement'' and ''Santiniketan the School'':

{{Quotation| I am not sure, however, if everyone noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan as an art movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position and the other a modernist position. I am not suggesting that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.|''ALL THE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF THE LIVED WORLD &lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The shared perspectives==
{{Quotation|The brief survey of the individual works of the core Santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but by a community of ideas. Which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward. Thus they do not represent a school but a movement.|''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism, 1997}}

A '''sculpture trail''' - also known as "a culture walk" or "art trail" - is a [[walkway]] through [[Open-air museums|open-air galleries]] of [[outdoor sculpture]]s along a defined route with sequenced viewings encountered from planned preview and principal sight lines.

==Settings==
Often the distinct walkway is one choice among other less structured ways of exploring intimate [[sculpture garden]]s, larger [[sculpture park]]s and expansive environmental art sites. They are often disabled and [[wheelchair access]]ible routes offering viewing and experiencing the art for many.

Sculptural works of [[land art]] and larger [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] outdoor [[installation art]], especially in fragile natural [[habitats]], use sculpture trails for low-impact accessibility. Some culture walks have sculptor-in-residence programs for creating new temporary or permanent works.

Sculpture trail settings can range from [[urban park]]s and private estates, through art museum gardens, to large regional open space and art [[park]] sites, with walkways giving access to the [[sculpture]]s.

The '''St. Louis Symphony Orchestra''' is an American [[symphony orchestra]] based in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. Founded in 1880 by Joseph Otten as the St. Louis Choral Society, the St. Louis Symphony is the second-oldest professional symphony orchestra in the United States, preceded only by the [[New York Philharmonic]]. Its principal concert venue is [[Powell Hall]].

==History==
The St. Louis Choral Society performed in the auditorium of the [[St. Louis Mercantile Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~landc/bookplates/20_4_StLouisMercantile.htm| last=Hoover| first=John Neal| title=St. Louis Mercantile Library| journal=Journal of Library History| volume=20| issue=4| pages=440–443| date=Fall 1985| accessdate=2008-02-21| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704154632/http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~landc/bookplates/20_4_StLouisMercantile.htm| archivedate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Locust and Broadway in [[Downtown St. Louis]]. During the 1881/82 season the 80-member chorus was joined by an orchestra of 31 members. A disbanded Musical Union joined the group. In 1893, the St. Louis Choral-Symphony was formally incorporated. It remained largely a choral organization through its performances at the [[1904 World's Fair]] under [[Alfred Ernst]] when it expanded to a 200-member chorus and an orchestra of 55. Under [[Max Zach]]'s tenure (1907 to 1921), it changed its name to the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Before moving to its current home in [[Powell Symphony Hall|Powell Hall]], the SLSO performed for many years at the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]]. The orchestra has given concerts regularly at [[Carnegie Hall]] and has made overseas tours to Europe and to Japan. The St. Louis Symphony has recorded for the Columbia, RCA Victor, Red Seal, Telarc, Vox/Turnabout, Angel EMI, and Nonesuch labels. It has also issued CD recordings on its own label, Arch Media, and has received seven [[Grammy Award]]s and 58 nominations. For [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]], the St. Louis Symphony has been the resident orchestra since 1978, divided into two ensembles, each performing two of the operas in the season.  Also associated with the orchestra is the St. Louis Symphony Chorus, which was founded in 1977. Its first director was Thomas Peck.  Since 1995, Amy Kaiser has served as the chorus director. 

The national prestige of the St. Louis Symphony grew most prominently during the music directorship of [[Leonard Slatkin]], from 1979 to 1996. During his tenure, the orchestra made many recordings for the EMI and RCA Victor labels, and toured to Europe and the Far East, as well as concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]]. However, this growth in prestige was not matched by stabilization of long-term finances. In 2000, the SLSO's endowment stood at [[United States dollar|US$]]28&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2000-11-01/culture/muse.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201073602/http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2000-11-01/culture/muse.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=1 February 2013| title=Facing the Music| work=[[Riverfront Times]]| first=Eddie| last=Silva| date=1 November 2000| accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the executive director and President of the SLSO at the time, Don Roth, had secured a US$40&amp;nbsp;million challenge grant from the Taylor family (owners of privately held [[Enterprise Rent-A-Car]]) to help the organization's money situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2001-09-12/culture/muse.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201133630/http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2001-09-12/culture/muse.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=1 February 2013| title=Stop the Music| work=Riverfront Times| first=Eddie| last=Silva| date=12 September 2001| accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same year, he revealed the situation of severe financial problems with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra finances, which nearly led to the orchestra's bankruptcy in 2001. Roth resigned his position in July 2001, and was succeeded by Randy Adams, a former St. Louis bank executive. Adams embarked on extensive fund-raising efforts in the following years, seeking to enlarge the SLSO's endowment in the process. As part of the budget cuts and cost-saving measures, the musicians agreed to salary cuts over that time, and also a reduction of their 52-week contract to 42 weeks.

Following the departure of Hans Vonk as music director after the 2001-2002 season, [[Itzhak Perlman]] served as music adviser to the orchestra from 2002 to 2004. In December 2003, the symphony's board announced David Robertson as the next music director of the orchestra, effective with the 2005/06 season.  

In January 2005, a labor dispute led to a cancellation of concerts for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0120/p11s02-almp.html |title=Symphony strike echoes across US |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Sarah Bryan |last=Miller |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/04/national/04orch.html| title=Labor Dispute Halts Music in St. Louis| newspaper=The New York Times| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=4 January 2005| accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/arts/music/17loui.html| title=The Silence in St. Louis Is Starting to Hurt| newspaper=The New York Times| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=17 February 2005| accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the musicians could vote on the terms of the new contract, management changed the locks to Powell Hall without notifying them. Auditions were cancelled, and the health insurance for musicians was cancelled without notice as well.  Whilst the musicians considered themselves to be 'locked out', management considered this action to be an illegal strike, since the players' attorney, Leonard Leibowitz, had advised them against filing certain documents as required by law.  The National Labor Relations Board agreed with management. After a two-month period of negotiations, the musicians agreed to a ten-week reduction from a 52-week season, and 30% wage reductions. Upon returning to the stage, the musicians enacted a "Vote of No Confidence" on Executive Director Randy Adams. Both parties then reached a mutual agreement under which they agreed to refer to the eight-week period as a "Work Stoppage" and the "Vote of No Confidence" was rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/1465.html

Since September 2005, the American conductor [[David Robertson (conductor)|David Robertson]] has been the music director of the orchestra.  During Robertson's tenure, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra has partnered with [[KWMU|St. Louis Public Radio]] to broadcast its subscription concerts live every Saturday night during its regular season, since the fall of 2010, after the sale of the St. Louis classical radio station [[KFUO-FM|KFUO]].  Robertson conducted the orchestra's first-ever appearance at [[The Proms]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Tim| last=Ashley| title=Prom 71: St Louis Symphony/Robertson| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/05/prom-71-st-louis-symphony-review| work=[[The Guardian]]| location=Manchester| date=2012-09-05| accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2013, Robertson's contract was extended through the 2015/16 season, and a further contract extension, announced in March 2014, was through the 2017/18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.stlsymphony.org/en/about-us/press-room/current-press-releases-and-archives/2014/2014-3-04-david-robertson-contract-extension/| title=St. Louis Symphony Announces Contract Extension with Music Director David Robertson through 2017–2018| publisher=St. Louis Symphony| date=4 March 2014| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the SLSO and Robertson jointly announced an additional one-year extension of his contract through the 2018-2019 season, at which time he is scheduled to conclude his SLSO tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| title=David Robertson will leave the SLSO at end of 2018-19 season| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/david-robertson-will-leave-the-slso-at-end-of-/article_b1d51d29-2408-588d-9612-f902d7927f76.html| work=[[St Louis Post-Dispatch]]| date=2016-12-20| accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017, the orchestra noted an update to Robertson's contract, where he is scheduled to conclude his tenure in 2017-2018, in a reversion of the December 2016 situation.&lt;ref name="Deneve2017"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.stlsymphony.org/en/about-us/press-room/current-press-releases-and-archives/2017/06-07-17---Stephane-Deneve-Named-Music-Director-of-the-St-Louis-Symphony/| title=Stéphane Denève Named Music Director of the St. Louis Symphony| publisher=St. Louis Symphony| date=7 June 2017| accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams stood-down as the orchestra's president and executive director in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, "SLSO President and Executive Director Randy Adams Announces Resignation". Press release, 20 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Symphony president says he will step aside in June".

''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', 15 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with declining ticket sales and deficits, Bronstein immediately launched an aggressive new revenue plan with audience development at the core of its actions. Bronstein has also taken steps to broaden and diversify the symphony's programming through popularly oriented programming series such as "Live at Powell Hall". Since 2008, because of new programming and marketing strategies, ticket revenues have grown 39% in the 2012 fiscal year, the highest revenues in over a decade, while seats sold grew by 16% and more than 31,000 new people were added to the customer base, reversing five years of decline. Because of successful audience development initiatives at the core of the plan as well as other revenue progress and strong management of expenses, the structural deficit (whose gaps are funded by additional contributions) has declined 18% from $3.4M in 2007 to $2.8M in 2011, dipping as low as $2.62m in 2010.

Symphony management undertook a rebranding in 2010, by adopting of a new logo and a new look and changing its name from the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) to the St. Louis Symphony. The move was not received with universal approval, and many, including members of the local news media, proved resistant to the marketing-based change. The name was changed back, without fanfare, in the summer of 2017.

Bronstein left the SLSO to head the Peabody Conservatory in Spring 2014. In February 2015, the SLSO named Marie-Hélène Bernard, then-president of the [[Handel and Haydn Society]] as its new president and CEO. She began her new job on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/st-louis-symphony-orchestra-names-new-president-and-ceo/article_96036f5f-6c33-542a-a7e1-ec93734433b0.html| title=St. Louis Symphony Orchestra names new president and CEO| work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| date=2015-02-11| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saint Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra|STL Symphony Youth Orchestra]] was established in 1970 by Leonard Slatkin.  The post of Resident Conductor (formerly Assistant Conductor), who also acts as music director of the Saint Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra, is currently held by Gemma New.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/slso-appoints-gemma-new-as-resident-conductor/article_1357a9af-3906-58e3-9a18-00f0b8d64532.html| title=SLSO appoints Gemma New as resident conductor| work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| date=2016-06-02| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past St. Louis Symphony Orchestra Assistant Conductors have included Slatkin, Gerhardt Zimmermann, David Loebel, David Amado, Scott Parkman, [[Ward Stare]], and Steven Jarvi.

In 2003, [[Stéphane Denève]] first guest-conducted the orchestra.  In June 2017, the orchestra named Denève as its next music director, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.  He is to hold the title of Music Director Designate for the 2018-2019 season.&lt;ref name="Deneve2017"/&gt;

The '''Star Awards''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 红星大奖) is an annual ceremony held in Singapore where the media organisation [[Mediacorp]] recognises entertainers under their employment for outstanding performances of the year.

==History==
The first ever annual Star Awards event was held in 1994. In the first three years of the Awards, MediaCorp handed out just 10 Most Popular Artistes awards (five for each gender) instead of the current 20 (10 for each gender).&lt;ref name=stdyk&gt;{{cite news | title = Things you didn't know about the Star Awards | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 2006-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best Actor and Best Actress awards were only introduced in 1995. Prior to that, it was more of a popularity contest, with [[Li Nanxing]], [[Chew Chor Meng]] and Zoe Tay winning the Most Popular Actor and Actress award.&lt;ref name=stdyk /&gt;

In 1995, a top gun of Hong Kong's TVB was one of the guests at the Star Awards. When giving out the award, he commented on the significance of the awards in recognizing television talents. He wished that Hong Kong will have similar television award ceremony in future. In less than 2 years after his return to Hong Kong, the [[TVB Anniversary Awards]] was born.

The Star Awards has traditionally been held at the TV Theatre on Caldecott Hill. Though there were some exceptions, the first being in 1996 where this annual event was being held at Harbour Pavilion, and 2006, when it was held at [[St James Power Station]].&lt;ref name=stdyk /&gt;

Previously, technical category awards (e.g. Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Variety Show Producer, etc.), newscaster and current affairs awards and, for a time, the Young Talent Award (for child actors) were held separately at a gala dinner due to time constraints and results and clips from the event would be shown at the ceremony. From 2010 to 2015, all awards were presented at the ceremony proper and the awards ceremony had been split into two shows. For Show 1, it was held at Caldecott Broadcast Centre throughout the above-mentioned period. For Show 2, it was held at [[Resorts World Sentosa]] in 2010 and 2011, at [[Marina Bay Sands]] in 2012 and 2013, at [[Suntec City]] in 2014 and at Caldecott Broadcast Centre in 2015.

In 2016, technical category awards were reverted to being presented at an off-site ceremony. Despite this, there still were two shows, where the programme and performance category awards were split equally. Both shows were held at the new Mediacorp campus at 1 Stars Avenue.

In 2017, a new format is introduced, whereby there is only one main show and three one-hour prelude episodes leading to it. Technical category awards (and Young Talent Award) are split equally among the three prelude episodes to be presented.

The award ceremonies were held in end of the year from 1998 to 2007. From 2009 onwards, the Star Awards would be held annually in April to honour television talents from works from the previous year. Hence, there was no ceremony in the year 2008.

With the merger of [[MediaCorp]] with [[SPH MediaWorks]] on 1 January 2005, nominees now include artistes and shows from [[MediaCorp Channel U]], formerly MediaWork's [[SPH MediaWorks Channel U|Chinese language channel]]. The ceremony was broadcast on Channel U in 2005 for the first time.

==Trophy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lolmcs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The current Star Awards trophy, which was first designed in Year 2000.]] --&gt;
The Star Awards trophy has seen four different designs, since its inception in 1994.
* 1994: The trophy was a circular column with a star-shaped circle capping the top.
* 1995 - 1997: The trophy was a straight column topped with a gold star.
* 1998 - 1999: The trophy was changed to a cone-like shape with a bigger star.
* 2000–present: A new trophy made in Shanghai was designed, weighing 4&amp;nbsp;kg and cost S$1,000 each. It is designed with a crystal body shaped in the letter "S", and from another angle, shaped in the letter "A", forming the initials of the "Star Awards". The trophy used to come in different colors every year.

'''Surveillance Art''' is the use of technology intended to record human behavior in a way that offers commentary on the process of [[surveillance]] or the technology used to surveil.  Surveillance Art manifests itself in many different forms, from short films to architecture, but all have been shown to provide some type of critical response to the rise of surveillance by various authorities and the technology used to achieve it, especially when dealing with issues of security and enforcing laws.

==History==
With new technology, came new surveillance and new ways of responding to it through artistic media. With the advent of video-recording devices, closed circuit television, and digital cameras, remote surveillance of subjects became possible. One of the most popular figures to adapt these new methods of surveillance to art was [[Andy Warhol]].

Warhol’s movie, ''Outer and Inner Space'', introduced the performance-art possibilities of high-tech surveillance to the modern world. At the same time, it provided the observed subject with the image or knowledge of being observed, in this case the actress [[Edie Sedgwick]]. "On the left, Sedgwick's video image, in full profile, gazes off to the right, looking up as if she were talking to someone standing above her. On the right, the 'real' (or 'live') Edie sits in three-quarter profile facing left, addressing someone sitting off-screen to the left of Warhol's movie camera -- an arrangement which at times creates the illusion that we are watching Sedgwick in conversation with her own image."&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Callie. "Andy Warhol. Outer and Inner Space.." CNTRL[SPACE]. hosting.zkm.de/ctrlspace/e/texts/56 (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twentieth century, the AIDS epidemic, cancer rates, and other health concerns created a new form of surveillance. Suddenly, the condition of the human body and potential for contagion became an addition to existing systems of observation.

"The ‘my body, my business’ ideal in the clinical setting dovetailed with broader societal concerns about snoops, spies, and surveillance, setting the stage for a fundamental recasting of the politics of surveillance in the last decades of the twentieth century. The encounter over HIV represented the high water mark of patient participation in the politics of surveillance. "&lt;ref&gt;"H-Net Announcement." Humanities and Social Sciences Net Online. www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=150810  (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Modern===

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 sparked a new wave of American surveillance of the citizen body. This was primarily a form of electronic information gathering—monitoring of phones and email, Internet use, tracking and tracing of cell phones and GPS units. In certain instances, the detaining and/or monitoring of U.S. citizens of various ethnicities compounded the already growing debate on the violation of civil liberties. In July 2006, Ms. [[Mary DeRosa]], a Senior Fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, testified at a congressional hearing on the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. At this point, different organizations within the United States government had been applying separate acts to monitor perceived threats of foreign agents, sometimes at cross-purposes and with varying degrees of rights violation.

DeRosa stated: "The national security agencies and their employees are charged with protecting the United States from harm. When faced with a decision about whether to take a step that invades liberties they will not always be able to judge whether it is the only way or the best way to address a problem -- or whether it is simply the easiest way."&lt;ref&gt;"Statement of Mary B. DeRosa on FISA for the 21st Century." FAS Intelligence Resource Program. www.fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/072606derosa.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As homeland security issues forced questions of the infringement of civil liberties, the response of various practitioners of surveillance art questioned the notion of privacy. In one of the most notorious cases, the price of innocence and freedom seems to be the willing sacrifice of one’s personal privacy.

The case of [[Hasan Elahi]] has also addressed new technologies in surveillance: tracking and tracing of cell phones, the capabilities of [[GPS]] technology, and worldwide Internet access by both the observer and the observed. The relationship between the watcher and the body watched becomes an impetus to the artwork itself.

Elahi has stated of his art: "Both quantitative and qualitative information is incorporated into my work, and the entire process results in translations and mistranslations between the physical and the virtual, between the body politic and the singular citizen. The mutual misunderstandings that inevitably occur provide the inertial energy for the continuing activity and effectiveness of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Elahi, Hasan. "Hasan Elahi." Hasan Elahi. http://elahi.sjsu.edu/ (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Futurist===

The latest evolution of response to surveillance systems is to become the system. New forms of [[biometric]] surveillance—such as heart rate monitors, and facial recognition software—are being utilized for personalized experiences and amusement park rides.&lt;ref&gt;Pohflep, Sascha. "Biometric." We Make Money not Art.  http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/biometric/ (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond biometrics is the integration of cybernetic technology into Surveillance Art. The Canadian filmmaker, Robert Spence, has adapted a miniature camera into his prosthetic eye. In an odd reversal, Spence has finally come full circle with the concept of Surveillance Art: ‘"Originally the whole idea was to do a documentary about surveillance. I thought I would become a sort of super hero … fighting for justice against surveillance," Spence said. "In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras. But the strange thing I discovered was that people don’t care about the surveillance cameras, they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy."&lt;ref&gt;Klint, Finley. "Surveillance." Renegade Futurist.  http://renegadefuturist.com/archives/category/surveillance/ (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularized Areas==

===Performance===

On May 3, 2008, artists Robin Hewlett and Ben Kinsley staged a simulated street scene in a Pittsburgh neighborhood when the [[Google Street View]] team came through. They named the project "Street with a View" which they describe as introducing "fiction, both subtle and spectacular, into the doppelganger world of Google Street View." Using an array of local residents and actors, scenes included a marathon, a parade, a garage band practice, firemen rescuing a cat, and a sword fight. This was the first time that Google Street View had been used as a means of art, specifically, as surveillance art.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, Robin, and Ben Kinsley. "STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley." STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley. http://www.streetwithaview.com/index.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players (SCP), based in New York City and founded by Bill Brown, are one of the main innovators of this art form. This group of actors stages various plays in public spaces, their first one being [[Alfred Jarry]]’s "[[Ubu Roi]]" on December 10, 1996 at the 14th Street-Union Square Subway station. They have performed other famous works such as [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s ''[[The Raven]]'', [[George Orwell]]’s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|"1984"]] and ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Their plays are staged in very public places such as subway stations, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Washington Square Park, Union Square, and various other landmarks throughout the city. Their primary purpose is to create a public spectacle in order to get people to question the role surveillance plays in their lives. These performances may be witnessed by the public, yet the actual recordings of these performances remain inaccessible. The SCP is said to have been inspired by the anti-surveillance manifesto, "Guerilla Programming of Surveillance Equipment," but state that they were not the first to stage surveillance camera theater.&lt;ref&gt;"Setting the Stage for the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/gpvse.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; They state that it was the invention of comedy writers:

Properly speaking, surveillance camera theater was invented by a comedy writer, not a privacy advocate or a performance artist: i.e., the person(s) who in 1981 wrote the "On the Job" episode of the American TV sit-com ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', in which Alex Reiger (played by [[Judd Hirsch]]) temporarily gets a job as a camera-watching security guard. Bored by the isolation and silence, Alex eventually learns to pass the time by improvising skits in front of the surveillance camera and watching himself on the monitor at the same time. When Alex's shift is over, he is replaced by a veteran of the place (played by "Grampa" [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]), who pulls out a ventriloquist's dummy and starts performing in front of the surveillance camera as soon as his shift begins! The implication was that every security guard—when no one (else) was looking—was passing the time in this way. On October 12, 1992, [[Saturday Night Live]] included a skit that imagined that during the night, when everyone else had gone home, the people who worked at Rockefeller Center would amuse themselves and each other by putting on little skits in front of the building's surveillance cameras. As in Taxi, none of these skits had any political content and none of them concerned privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Before the Formation of the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/scp-antecedents.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCP has a wide following around the world and has even spawned sister groups in Arizona, California, Italy, Lithuania, Sweden, and Turkey suggesting how the issue of surveillance is one which transcends nationalities and cultures, bringing people together to make one synonymous public statement.&lt;ref&gt;"Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural===

Some surveillance artists choose to use architecture as canvases. The buildings and structures they use are in highly visible areas with lots of pedestrians. The artists install a surveillance system that tracks human movement through and/or around the structure. The system is connected to a viewing format, such as a large screen or light installation, which are triggered by human movement. As one artist describes it, "All the visual elements in the projection result from people’s movements through the space."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art.http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance art elicits interaction from viewers while making them more aware of the pervasiveness of surveillance.

Some architectural surveillance art pieces involve large screen installations or projections on highly visible buildings in populated areas. Artist [[Christian Moeller]]’s 2006 project, "Nosy," includes a street-level camera which records the active surrounding environment, including pedestrians, cars, and a nearby train in Osaki City, Japan. The real-time video is "displayed in bitmap graphics [and projected] onto three towers covered with white LEDs behind frosted glass panels."&lt;ref&gt;"A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller." A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller. http://www.christian-moeller.com/display.php?project_id=59&amp;play=true (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Nosy.jpeg|Christian Moeller's Mojo utilizes a street-level camera to record the active surrounding environment in Osaki City, Japan. --&gt;

Artist [[Camille Utterback]] created a similar installation in 2007, called "Abundance," using the domed city hall of San Jose, California, as her interactive canvas. The installation includes a large surveillance camera focused on pedestrians and an abstract art animation, projected onto the city hall building. Pedestrians’ location and movement within the field of the camera are translated into abstract shapes that appear in the projection. As the pedestrian moves, the corresponding shape moves within the animation and interacts with other shapes in the projection. Utterback’s website states, "Movements and paths through the plaza become part of a collective visual record, and transform the building into a playful and dynamic canvas."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art. http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Abundance.jpg|Camille Utterback's Abundance uses San Jose's city hall as an interactive canvas. --&gt;

The Los Angeles-based artist team, Electroland, has been dedicated to working on interactive art projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their projects are architectural surveillance art through the use of light installations or electronic displays. One of their architectural installations, "Enteractive," uses both the inside and outside of a building in Los Angeles. This project, finished in 2006, involves tracking indoor participants’ movements and locations over a large floor light grid. Outside, their real-time locations and movement patterns are broadcast to anyone within view of the colored light grid installed onto the face of the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Enteractive.png |The outside of Electroland's Enteractive at 11th and Flower. --&gt;

Another of Electroland’s projects was incorporated into the Pedestrian Bridge of the Indianapolis Airport in 2008. The project, named "Connection," is made up of light "dots" that cover the length of the bridge, which light up in different colors as people pass through. The colored dots follow people’s movements and often interact with participants, "exhibit[ing] a range of intelligent and playful behaviors, accompanied by sounds."&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - EnterActive." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/enteractive (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Electroland has similar projects, including Target Breezeway, Lumen, and Drive By.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Lumen." Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/lumen (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Target Breezeway." Electroland -Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley. http://electroland.net/projects/targetbreezeway (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley ." Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/about/ (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Connection Bridge.png|Electroland's Connection on the Indianapolis Airport's Pedestrian Bridge. The lights change colors as pedestrians pass through the bridge. --&gt;

The French art team, Hehe, also works with architectural surveillance art but they prefer to take a "green" approach. Like Electroland, they have also done light installations, like their 2007 project in Luxembourg, "Grandes Lignes." This project includes light installations along a pedestrian footbridge that only light up where a pedestrian is located. Hehe describes the selective lighting as "the personal light sphere, which surrounds the traveler as they move from one end to the other." Hehe explains the intent behind the project: "The responsiveness of the system functions ecologically and economically – saving energy – and also metaphorically: Your shadow – of light – walks with you and follows you."&lt;ref&gt;"Grandes Lignes." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/grandeslignes/index.html(accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hehe has also started a set of projects under the title, "Pollstream," all of which are environmentally-focused. Of these, Nuage Vert, or "green cloud" in English, is architectural surveillance art. The 2008 project uses a thermo-sensitive camera and a laser with a green, cloud-shaped beam. Installed on a nearby building, the beam is projected onto the stream of pollution from a power plant in Helsinki, as a constant reminder to residents of their energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuage Vert." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/texte/nv/index.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Hehe’s focus in this project moves from direct surveillance of people to the surveillance of their factories and plants. Here, humans are being indirectly watched through what they produce, like air pollution. This is potentially the beginning of a move into air surveillance art.

===Inverse Surveillance/Sousveillance===

Inverse surveillance, or "[[sousveillance]]", makes use of surveillance technology such as cameras from the perspective of the participant, allowing the object of surveillance essentially to become the subject.  The term sousveillance was coined by [[Steve Mann]], a noted media artist.

Typical instances of sousveillance as art involve voluntarily recording and broadcasting one’s own activities (via webcam, for example).  The expressed purpose for this, in some cases, is to take away the value of the knowledge of the artist’s whereabouts and current activity. [[Hasan Elahi]], an interdisciplinary media artist who was falsely suspected of terrorism and detained by government authorities, has said that the goal of broadcasting his daily life is to devalue information about him since "Intelligence agencies, regardless of who they are, all operate in a market where their commodity is information, and the reason their information has value is because no one else has access to it."&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Elahi, Interview with Stephen Colbert.  http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/167606/may-07-2008/hasan-elahi (accessed 23 Apr. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by increasing access to the information, he is taking away the surveilling authority’s monopoly on it.

==Critical Responses==

The Surveillance Studies Network is an organization that focuses on surveillance and its various effects on society, and their online journal, ''Surveillance and Society'', publishes academic articles that present different aspects of surveillance.  In 2005, ''Surveillance and Society''’s second issue of the year featured two articles that included surveillance as an art form.

''The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment'' by Anders Albrechtslund and Lynsey Dubbeld takes an in depth look at surveillance and the roles it plays in art and popular culture.  Although Albrechtslund and Dubbeld focus on the entertainment factor of Surveillance Art, they also acknowledge its serious explorations and implications.  While Surveillance Art is entertainment, the artists "tend to focus on controversial aspects of surveillance practices or revealing the operation of surveillance technologies."  To illustrate this point, Albrechtslund and Dubbeld specifically referenced installation artist [[David Rokeby]].  "For instance, like several of Rokeby’s other works, ‘Sorting Daemon’ was concerned with revealing the powers of vision and surveillance, and bringing to the fore the discriminatory, judgmental classifications that computers are increasingly producing as they take over human tasks of observation and monitoring."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is observed that although surveillance has been prominent in art and other forms of entertainment, it hasn’t been studied in depth by Surveillance Studies scholars.  Albrechtslund and Dubbeld see a need for further exploration of this area of surveillance.  Surveillance as a form of entertainment isn’t paid as much attention as it deserves because it truly is a diverse field that is continuously developing.  "The entertaining side of surveillance is a phenomenon worth studying in itself, and we expect that this type of study will contribute to an understanding of the multi-faceted nature of surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In article, "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces," Robert W. Sweeny, an art educator at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, questioned surveillance technologies and the role that visual arts plays with those technologies.  He then raised the question of how one would handle acknowledging surveillance technologies in the classroom.  He is a firm believer that "Those involved with the visual arts might learn much from studies regarding current surveillance technologies, going beyond the boundaries of traditional research methodologies, informing practices that interrogate the dynamics of power and vision in art educational settings."&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching at The Pennsylvania State University, Sweeny used one project in particular to encourage his students to reveal "the power of the gaze" by exploring how surveillance brings about other ways of "seeing:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These students chose the museum as a space that is based in looking and the ‘male gaze’, influenced by our readings of the course text, ''Ways of Seeing'' (Berger, 1972). Doubling the gaze of the surveillance camera through hand held video, then recording the individual recording the camera, they created a layered experience that lead to confusion. Through a tight editing process, they constantly reminded the viewer of the position of the camera operator (and the apparent laxness of the security guard) through the rapidly shifting camera shots. The images begin to break up as filmed image was filmed, layered with music that approached noise, only to return to a calm denouement, backing out of the doors that introduced the walking protagonist into a panoptic hall of mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this project, the students not only created Surveillance Art, but by becoming the watchers, or what Sweeny would call the parasite, they were able to see beyond the environment that the museum created with its own surveillance cameras.

In his essays, interactive artist David Rokeby writes about the control and subjectivity that is created by artists who use technologies such as cameras:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The expressive power of the interface, in conjunction with the increasing 'apparent' transparency of interface technologies raises complicated ethical issues regarding subjectivity and control.  Interactive artists are in a position to take the lead in generating a discussion of these concerns, but, on the other hand, are also in danger of becoming apologists for industrial, corporate, and institutional uses of these technologies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rokeby has also written an essay for students who wish to create interactive art and he goes on to explain his perspective on the pieces he creates.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeby, David. "Transforming Mirrors: Subjectivity and Control in Interactive Media." David Rokeby - Media Installation Artist. http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/mirrors.html. (accessed February 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players have been the inspiration for others who have gone on to create artistic project that involve some form of surveillance, however, they say that although they are flattered that they inspire others, they’re rarely impressed by the work that is created.  Their complaint is that in the videos that are created, the artists usually end up promoting "several of the primary ideological supports for generalized surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Surveillance Camera Players. "Biting the Hands that Applaud Us." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html. (accessed April 1, 2009)..&lt;/ref&gt; These works of art fail to connect their audiences to the everyday people who are being watched.

==Legalities==

Legally, police officials consider Surveillance Art as an extraordinary method of keeping people safe. According to police officials in State College, Pennsylvania, surveillance is divided into three major concepts "national, mechanical, and perceived; all of which have transformed from legally used terms into art."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Surveillance is government-based surveillance that aids police officers as well as the community. As far as aiding the community with national surveillance, "all police vehicles are equipped with a hidden GPS locater that has the ability to transmit the position of a police vehicle anywhere in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the community, National Surveillance means that a police official’s vehicle is heavily monitored at all times, causing him to be reprimanded if not at the location reported. From a governmental perspective, National Surveillance is essential for aiding police officials in investigations or simply identifying criminals. The [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS) allows police officials to "fingerprint and receive information on anyone who has ever been fingerprinted in only fifteen to twenty minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Integrated Automated Fingerprint System." 13 March 2008. &lt;http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/iafis.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With the information gathered from an interview with a State College, Pennsylvania police officer, it is clear that National Surveillance has generated a type of "system balance" (between the government and the community) whose purpose with advancements in surveillance technology is to portray "truth."

Mechanical surveillance, although sharing similarities with National Surveillance, plays a somewhat different role in surveillance as an art form.  During the interview with the State College police officer, it was noted that "the camera in a police vehicle begins recording as soon as its emergency lights are switched on whether the vehicle is stopped or in motion."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mechanical surveillance plays a huge role in police investigation along with helping create surveillance art. With Internet sites like YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, people have the ability to create and share any type of video feed that interests them. As an example, the anonymous State College police officer referred to the riots at Penn State University after Penn State beat Ohio State University during the 2008-2009-football season. Several videos were posted on YouTube depicting celebratory acts that quickly transitioned into destructive malicious behavior. First, State College Police referred to these posted videos as police evidence in which they were able to apprehend and fine individuals involved in the riots. On the other hand, however, there are several videos of the riots in which inspirational music was added to portray "Penn State Pride" rather than committing an illegal act. Adding music to these types of videos transforms mechanical surveillance into Surveillance Art by creating an emotional attachment for the individuals who can relate to what the video visually portrays.

Perceived surveillance is a concept of Surveillance Art that is purely territorial and usually created by individuals involved with that particular community. Using State College, Pennsylvania as an example, an anonymous police officer stated that he believes Surveillance Art "creates a presence in the community that lowers the likelihood of crime, portraying a sense of ownership." With the advancement of technology in today’s society, it has become apparent that it is relatively easier for individuals to create "Perceived Surveillance Art." The interesting aspect of Perceived Surveillance Art is the fact that it can be anything. Examples of Perceived Surveillance Art can range from a mural on the side of a building to a simple statue of the baby Jesus in the front yard of an individual's home.

"With these created websites, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, it has become relatively easy for individuals to post and spread Surveillance Art throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. Pennsylvania State University. 19 February 2009. &lt;http://www.police.psu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, there are highly controversial videos (Rodney King beating and the shooting death of Oscar Grant by police officers) placed on these sites that have been edited to portray a specific individuals perception of that specific event or a different perspective on how that event should possibly be taken. When asking the State College police officer about how these sites affect police investigations, he stated that they "have no bearing on anything having to do with police work."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the new interpretations presented by the videos on these sites are welcomed by some police officers that like the idea and believe in Surveillance Art.

While discussing surveillance as an art form with a New York City bus driver, it was found to be "impossible for an individual to travel more than three blocks anywhere in New York without being on camera."&lt;ref&gt;Bus Driver Interview. Brooklyn, New York. 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When considering the three forms of surveillance (national, mechanical, and perceived) as art forms, it is clear that our society has evolved into a technically dependent era in which even the most reliable footage (unedited surveillance footage) can become art by simply transforming or even editing raw footage (adding music, or text) creating new material, resulting in Surveillance Art. Although the amount of surveillance in State College, Pennsylvania may not be as high as the amount of surveillance in New York City, it is interesting and notable that surveillance as an art form exists everywhere.

==Notable Examples==

These examples are representative of Surveillance Art's methods and effects. Although they use different technologies and tactics, they are united by an interest in the increasing prevalence of surveillance in modern society, and its effects on citizens and communities.

*Wireless Intelligent Systems Laboratory, directed by Stephen Wicker, and Human-Computer Interaction Group, headed by Geri Gay, created a Surveillance Art experiment, wherein the movements of visitors at the [[Herbert F.

{{Weather}}
In [[Middle Ages|medieval lore]], '''Tempestarii''' were weather making magicians who dwelt amongst the common people and possessed the power to raise or prevent storms at will. For this reason, anyone reputed as a weather-maker was the subject of respect, fear, and hatred in rural areas.

Perhaps the best known work on tempestarii was a 815 AD piece called "On Hail and Thunder" by a bishop, [[Agobard]] of Lyon.

Some describe it as a complaint of the irreligious beliefs of his flock, as villagers resented paying tithes to the church, but freely paid a form of insurance against storms to village ''tempestarii''; but, it was also noted, whenever a supposed weather-maker failed to prevent a storm, he or she would generally suffer the wrath of the populace, being victimised or killed.

A closer examination of Agobard's writing shows that he actually argues against the existence of weather-witches, but acquiesces that the saints of God are able to cause these things by praying with faith. He is more concerned with his flock's misunderstanding that these "witches" are obtaining power from the devil, and subsequent eagerness to kill or curse anyone able to work miracles. His key argument is that anyone capable of "raising a gale" would be one who has faith in God, a Christian, not a witch, because witches are not able to do such things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Perhaps the ones who attribute the making of hail to men would say that Moses reached his staff up to heaven and in this sense the storm was sent by human agency. Certainly Moses, the servant of God, was good and righteous, but these people do not dare to say that the so-called ‘storm-makers’ are good and righteous, but rather evil and unrighteous, deserving of both temporal and eternal condemnation, nor are they servants of God, except perhaps by circumstance rather than willing service. For if there were men who could cause hail, in imitation of Moses, they would surely be servants of God, not servants of the devil; although the passages cited above show that neither servants of God nor those of the devil cause of hail, but only omnipotent God...

{{sic|hide=yes|Therefore}} no human assistant should be sought in such events, because none will be found, except perhaps the saints of God, who have brought about, and are yet to bring about, many things. Some of them have the power to close up the heavens, lest it rain on days when they are prophesying, like Elijah; and to change water into blood and torment the earth with every plague as many times as they wish, as Moses and Aaron did to Egypt. Truly no other person sends hail in the summer, other than the one who sends snow in the winter. For there is a single reason for both these occurrences, when clouds are at either time raised higher than usual.

...not like these half-faithful of ours, who, as soon as they hear thunder, or when there is a breath of light wind, say ‘a gale is raised’ and curse, saying, ‘Cursed be the tongue that did these things, and may it be dried up and now be cut off.’ Pray tell, whom are you cursing? A righteous man or a sinner? For a sinner, partly unbelieving like you, cannot raise a gale, as you put it, because he is not able to by his own strength, nor can he command evil angels (nor do evil angels even have power in these matters)." &lt;ref&gt;https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agobard of Lyons also referenced a related belief amongst his parishioners—a belief that ''tempestarii'' were in league with a mythical race of cloud-dwellers who came from a land named '[[Magonia (mythology)|Magonia]]' ("Land of Magic", "Land of Thieves"). The Magonians were supposed to sail the skies in storm clouds; they would then pay [[Franks|Frankish]] ''tempestarii'' to summon up storms over farmlands, during which the Magonians could swoop down and steal the corn from the fields. On the particular occasion which prompted Agobard to write, several supposed Magonians had been taken prisoner by irate villagers shortly after a bad storm; the Bishop had been forced to intervene and debate with the villagers in order to save the prisoners' lives.

==Storm raising==
During the [[Witch-hunt|witch hunts]] the belief in witches who could raise storms was not limited to the Tempestarii. Depending on a witch's preference, they were believed to cause [[Storm|tempests]], [[hail]]storms, and [[lightning]]. Witches struck homes and crops alike, sank ships, killed men and animals, and it was believed they took great delight in the process. Church authorities gave credence to the belief by stating that [[God]] permitted the [[Devil]] and witches to perform these acts as punishment for the wickedness of the world.

Since ancient times around the world, the ability to control elements—including the raising of storms and causing rain—has been attributed to [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]], [[Shamanism|shamans]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]], and [[Witchcraft|witches]]. As early as 700 A.D., the [[Catholic Church]] prosecuted sorcerers for causing storms.

The most famous storm believed to be caused by witches was recorded in 1591 during the [[North Berwick Witch Trials]]. [[John Fian]] and his alleged coven of witches were accused of raising a sea storm to drown [[James I of England|James VI]] and [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] on their way from [[Denmark]].

On  the Tempestarii and Magonia see [[Valerie Flint|Valerie I. J. Flint]], ''The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;112.

==Remedies against tempestarii==
The Catholic Church prohibited [[Superstition|superstitious]] remedies against witchcraft such as storm raising because the remedies themselves were of [[Paganism|pagan]] origin. [[Prayer]], [[sacrament]]s, and the [[invocation]] of the name of God were prescribed instead with the belief that a person who had strong faith in God, kept the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]], and revered the [[rite]]s of the Church would be immune from storms and tempests raised by malicious witches.

Because many [[peasant]]s were reluctant to give up their superstitions as being false, the church also sanctioned remedies like the ringing of [[church bell]]s, believed to drive storm [[Demon|devils]] away, and placing [[Amulet|charms]] made from flowers consecrated on [[Palm Sunday]] in the crop fields. It was believed that if a storm did strike after the charm was placed, the owner's crops would be protected even if the surrounding land and crops were destroyed.

'''''The First Mourning''''' (in [[French language|French]] '''''Premier Deuil''''') is an oil on canvas painted in 1888 by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. Its dimensions are: 79 &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; × 99 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; inches (203 × 252&amp;nbsp;cm). This piece of art can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''National Museum of Fine Arts'') in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnba.gob.ar/en/the-collection-highlights/2770 Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Colección Permanente]. Retrieved on October 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work depicts the moment after [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] just found the body of their son [[Abel]], who was murdered by [[Cain]]. This is the first human death recorded in the [[Bible]]. Abel was the first martyr. 

[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] had suffered the loss of his second son shortly before painting this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artwork.php?artworkid=1743 Art Renewal] Retrieved on March 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Its original name is "''Premier Deuil''", in [[French language|French]], of which "''The First Mourning''" is a literal translation.

'''''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul''''' is a 1988 humorous [[fantasy]] [[detective fiction|detective]] novel by [[Douglas Adams]]. It is the second book by Adams featuring [[detective|private detective]] [[Dirk Gently]], the first being ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''. The title is a phrase that appeared in Adams' novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to describe the wretched boredom of immortal being [[Wowbagger|Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged]], and is a play on the theological treatise ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'', by [[Saint John of the Cross]].

The novel is named for that time on a Sunday, after afternoon but before evening, as the week-end had finished but the week had not yet begun, that occurred to Adams as a listless limbo of the working man:
{{bquote|In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Adams|title=The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul|date=1988-10-10|publisher=Heinemann|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
Dirk Gently, who calls himself a "[[holism|holistic]] detective", has happened upon what he thinks is a rather comfortable situation. A wealthy man in the [[record industry]] has retained him, spinning a story about being stalked by a seven-foot-tall, green-eyed, [[scythe]]-wielding monster. Dirk pretends to understand the man's ravings involving potatoes and a contract signed in blood coming due; when in reality, Dirk is musing about what he might do if he actually receives payment for his "services" – such as getting rid of his [[refrigerator]], which is so filthy inside that it has become the centrepiece of a show-down between himself and his cleaning woman. The seriousness of his client's claims becomes clear when Dirk arrives several hours late for an appointment to find a swarm of police around his client's estate. The aforementioned client is found in a sealed and heavily barricaded room, his head neatly removed several feet from his body and rotating on a [[Phonograph|turn-table]]. While at his recently deceased client's house, he discovers that his client had a son. However, after Dirk disconnects the television set the boy had been watching, the boy promptly breaks Dirk's nose.

Nearly incapacitated by guilt, Dirk resolves to take his now-late client's wild claims seriously. During his investigation, Gently encounters exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of [[Norse mythology]], insulting [[horoscope]]s, a sinister [[nursing home]], a [[nose|rhino]]-[[Phagy|phagic]] [[eagle]], an [[I Ching]] [[calculator]] (to which everything calculated above the value of 4 is apparently 'a suffusion of yellow'), a god who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive in exchange for clean [[linen]], and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't get [[Pizza delivery|pizza delivered]] in London.

==Adaptations==
A [[BBC]] radio adaptation, [[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (radio serial)|''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul'']], starring [[Harry Enfield]], [[Peter Davison]], [[John Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethetitle.com/06_hda/hda_series2.php |title=Above The Title – The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul |accessdate=23 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009080223/http://www.abovethetitle.com/06_hda/hda_series2.php |archivedate=9 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] was broadcast on October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk40/thu.shtml#radio4|title=BBC – Press Office – Network Radio Programme Information Week 40 Thursday 2 October 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112221637/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk40/thu.shtml#radio4|archivedate=12 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''winged unicorn''' (or '''flying unicorn''') is a fictional horse with wings like [[Pegasus]] and the horn of a [[unicorn]]. This creature has no specific name, but in some literature and media, it has been referred to as an '''alicorn''', a Latin word for the [[Unicorn horn|horn of a unicorn]], especially in alchemical texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Odell |last= Shepard |title= The Lore of the Unicorn |year= 1930 |location= London |publisher= Unwin and Allen |isbn= 9781437508536}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a '''pegacorn,''' a [[portmanteau]] of pegasus and unicorn.

Winged unicorns have been depicted in art. Ancient [[Achaemenid Assyria]]n seals depict winged unicorns and winged bulls as representing evil, but winged unicorns can also represent light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OarxGMWrgkC&amp;pg=PA18 |page= 18 |isbn= 9780766185302 |title= The Unicorn: A Mythological Investigation |last= Brown |first= Robert |year= 2004 |publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Ancient Seals from the Near East in the Metropolitan Museum: Old and Middle Persian Seals |first= Hans Henning |last= Von Der Osten |journal= The Art Bulletin |volume= 13 |issue= 2 |date= June 1931 |pages= 221–41 |jstor= 3050798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish poet [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote of imagining a winged beast that he associated with ecstatic destruction. The beast took the form of a winged unicorn in his 1907 play ''The Unicorn from the Stars'' and later that of the rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem in his poem "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yeats's Conflicts with His Audience, 1897–1917 |first= David |last= Ward |journal= ELH |volume= 49 |issue= 1 |date= Spring 1982 |pages= 155–6 |jstor= 2872885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wuthering Heights''''', [[Emily Brontë]]'s only novel, was published in 1847 under the pseudonym "Ellis Bell". It was written between October 1845 and June 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fN0gOdKQZD4C|title=Wuthering Heights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wuthering Heights'' and [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[Agnes Grey]]'' were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]]'s novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of ''Wuthering Heights'' and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/charlotte.html |title=Wuthering Heights: Publication &amp; Contemporary CriticalReception |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Wuthering Heights'' is now a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews were deeply polarised; it was controversial because of its unusually stark depiction of mental and physical cruelty, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day regarding religious [[hypocrisy]], [[morality]], [[social class|social classes]] and [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/critics.html |title=Later Critical Response to Wuthering Heights |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/contemp_rev.html |title=Excerpts from Contemporary Reviews |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/charlotte.html |title='&amp;#39;Wuthering Heights'&amp;#39;: Publication &amp; Contemporary Critical Reception |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet and painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], although an admirer of the book,  referred to it as "A fiend of a book&amp;nbsp;– an incredible monster&amp;nbsp; [...] The action is laid in hell,&amp;nbsp;– only it seems places and people have English names there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924013541895/cu31924013541895_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti to William Allingham, 1854–1870" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Wuthering Heights'' has been seen as having elements of [[gothic fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/gothic-elements-in-wuthering-heights.html|title=Gothic Elements in Wuthering Heights |website=Study.com|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another significant aspect is the moorland setting.  The novel has inspired adaptations, including film, radio and television dramatisations, a musical, a ballet, operas, and a [[Wuthering Heights (song)|song]] by [[Kate Bush]].

==Plot==

===Opening (chapters 1 to 3)===
In 1801, [[Lockwood (Wuthering Heights)|Lockwood]], a wealthy young man from the South of England, who is seeking peace and recuperation, rents Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He visits his [[landlord]], [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]], who lives in a remote [[moorland]] farmhouse, [[Wuthering Heights (fictional location)|Wuthering Heights]]. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff, who seems to be a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the reserved mistress of the house, who is in her mid-teens; and a young man, who seems to be a member of the family, yet dresses and speaks as if he is a servant.

Snowed in, Lockwood is grudgingly allowed to stay and is shown to a bedchamber, where he notices books and graffiti left by a former inhabitant named [[Catherine Earnshaw|Catherine]]. He falls asleep and has a nightmare, in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.

At sunrise, Heathcliff escorts Lockwood back to Thrushcross Grange. After his visit to the Heights, Lockwood becomes ill and is confined to his bed for some length of time. The Grange housekeeper, [[Ellen (Nelly) Dean]], who is looking after him, tells him the story of the family at the Heights during his convalescence.

=== Heathcliff's childhood (chapters 4 to 17) ===
Thirty years earlier, the [[landed property|owner]] of Wuthering Heights was Mr. Earnshaw, who lived with his son [[Hindley Earnshaw|Hindley]] and younger daughter Catherine. On a trip to [[Liverpool]], Earnshaw encounters a homeless boy, described as a "dark-skinned gypsy in aspect". He adopts the boy and names him Heathcliff. Hindley feels that Heathcliff has supplanted him in his father's affections and becomes bitterly [[jealous]]. Catherine and Heathcliff become friends and spend hours each day playing on the moors. They grow close.

Hindley is sent to university/college. Three years later Earnshaw dies, and Hindley becomes the landowner; he is now master of Wuthering Heights. He returns to live there with his new wife, Frances. He allows Heathcliff to stay, but only as a servant, and regularly mistreats him.

[[File:The Climb to Top Withens. - geograph.org.uk - 393405.jpg|thumb|left|The climb to Top Withens, thought to have inspired the Earnshaws' home in ''Wuthering Heights'']]

A few months after Hindley's return, Heathcliff and Catherine walk to Thrushcross Grange to spy on [[Edgar Linton|Edgar]] and Isabella Linton, who live there. After being discovered, they try to run away, but are caught. Catherine is injured by the Lintons' dog and taken into the house to recuperate, while Heathcliff is sent home. Catherine stays with the Lintons. The Lintons are [[landed gentry]], and Catherine is influenced by their elegant appearance and genteel manners. When she returns to Wuthering Heights, her appearance and manners are more ladylike, and she laughs at Heathcliff's unkempt appearance. The next day, knowing that the Lintons are to visit, Heathcliff, upon Nelly's advice, tries to dress up, in an effort to impress Catherine, but he and Edgar get into an argument, and Hindley humiliates Heathcliff by locking him in the attic. Catherine tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.

The following year, Frances Earnshaw gives birth to a son, named [[Hareton Earnshaw|Hareton]], but she dies a few months later. Hindley descends into drunkenness. Two more years pass, and Catherine and Edgar Linton become friends, while she becomes more distant from Heathcliff. Edgar visits Catherine while Hindley is away, and they declare themselves lovers soon afterwards.

Catherine confesses to Nelly that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted, although her love for Edgar is not comparable to her love for Heathcliff, whom she cannot marry because of his low social status and lack of education. She hopes to use her position as Edgar's wife to raise Heathcliff's standing. Heathcliff overhears her say that it would "degrade" her to marry him (but not how much she loves him), and he runs away and disappears without a trace. Distraught over Heathcliff's departure, Catherine makes herself ill. Nelly and Edgar begin to pander to her every whim to prevent her from becoming ill again.

Three years pass. Edgar and Catherine marry and go to live together at Thrushcross Grange, where Catherine enjoys being "lady of the manor". Six months later, Heathcliff returns, now a wealthy gentleman. Catherine is delighted, but Edgar is not. Edgar's sister, [[Isabella Linton|Isabella]], soon falls in love with Heathcliff, who despises her, but encourages the infatuation as a means of revenge. This leads to an argument with Catherine at Thrushcross Grange, which Edgar overhears. Finally, enraged by Heathcliff's constant appearance and foul parlance, he forbids Heathcliff from visiting Catherine altogether. Upset, Catherine locks herself in her room and begins to make herself ill again.  She is also now pregnant with Edgar's child.

Heathcliff takes up residence at Wuthering Heights and spends his time gambling with Hindley and teaching Hareton bad habits. Hindley dissipates his wealth and mortgages the farmhouse to Heathcliff to pay his debts. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella Linton. Two months after their elopement, Heathcliff and Isabella return to Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying. With Nelly's help, he visits Catherine secretly. The following day, she gives birth to a daughter, [[Catherine Linton|Cathy]], shortly before dying. While Catherine is lying in her coffin overnight, prior to the funeral, Heathcliff returns and replaces the lock of Edgar's hair in her necklace with a lock of his own.

Shortly after the funeral, Isabella leaves Heathcliff and finds refuge in the South of England. She gives birth to a son, Linton. Hindley dies six months after Catherine, and Heathcliff thus finds himself master of Wuthering Heights.

=== Heathcliff's maturity (chapters 18 to 31) ===
[[File:TopWithensPlaque.jpg|right|thumb|200x|Brontë Society plaque at Top Withens]]

Twelve years pass. Catherine's daughter, Cathy, has become a beautiful, high-spirited girl. Edgar learns that his sister Isabella is dying, so he leaves to retrieve her son Linton in order to adopt and educate him. Cathy, who has rarely left home, takes advantage of her father's absence to venture further afield. She rides over the moors to Wuthering Heights and discovers that she has not one but two cousins: Hareton, in addition to Linton. She also lets it be known that her father has gone to fetch Linton. When Edgar returns with Linton, a weak and sickly boy, Heathcliff insists that he live at Wuthering Heights.

Three years pass. Walking on the moors, Nelly and Cathy encounter Heathcliff, who takes them to Wuthering Heights to see Linton and Hareton. Heathcliff hopes that Linton and Cathy will marry, so that Linton will become the heir to Thrushcross Grange. Linton and Cathy begin a secret friendship, echoing the childhood friendship between their respective parents, Heathcliff and Catherine. Nelly finds out about the letters.

The following year, Edgar becomes very ill and takes a turn for the worse while Nelly and Cathy are out on the moors, where Heathcliff and Linton trick them into entering Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff keeps them captive to enable the marriage of Cathy and Linton to take place. After five days, Nelly is released, and later, with Linton's help, Cathy escapes. She returns to the Grange to see her father shortly before he dies.

Now master of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, Cathy's father-in-law, Heathcliff, insists on her returning to live at Wuthering Heights. Soon after she arrives, Linton dies. Hareton tries to be kind to Cathy, but she withdraws from the world.

At this point, Nelly's tale catches up to the present day (1801). Time passes and, after being ill for a period, Lockwood grows tired of the moors and informs Heathcliff that he will be leaving Thrushcross Grange.

=== Ending (chapters 32 to 34) ===
Eight months later, Lockwood returns to the area by chance. Given that his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange is still valid, he decides to stay there again. He finds Nelly living at Wuthering Heights and enquires what has happened since he left. She explains that she moved to Wuthering Heights to replace the housekeeper, Zillah, who had left.

Hareton has an accident and is confined to the farmhouse. During his convalescence, he and Cathy overcome their mutual antipathy and become close. While their friendship develops, Heathcliff begins to act strangely and has visions of Catherine. He stops eating and, after four days of increasingly bad health, is found dead in Catherine's old room. He is buried next to Catherine.

Lockwood learns that Hareton and Cathy plan to marry on New Year's Day. As he gets ready to leave, he passes the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff and pauses to contemplate the quiet of the moors.

== Characters ==
* '''[[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]]''': Found, presumably orphaned, on the streets of Liverpool and taken by Mr. Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family. He and Catherine grow close and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a [[Byronic hero]], but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that "Heathcliff" is both his given name and his surname.
* '''[[Catherine Earnshaw]]''': First introduced to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to be more like Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences for all the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sandra M. and Susan Gubar. ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imagination''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Edgar Linton]]''': Introduced as a child in the Linton family, he resides at Thrushcross Grange. Edgar's style and manners are in sharp contrast to those of Heathcliff, who instantly dislikes him, and of Catherine, who is drawn to him. Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results to all characters in the story.
* '''[[Nelly Dean]]''': The main narrator of the novel, Nelly is a servant to three generations of the Earnshaws and two of the Linton family. Humbly born, she regards herself nevertheless as Hindley's foster-sister (they are the same age and her mother is his nurse). She lives and works among the rough inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, but is well-read, and she also experiences the more genteel manners of Thrushcross Grange. She is referred to as Ellen, her given name, to show respect, and as Nelly among those close to her. Critics have discussed how far her actions as an apparent bystander affect the other characters and how much her narrative can be relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=James|year=1958|title=''The Villain in'' Wuthering Heights|journal=|volume=|issue=|page=17|url=http://livingston.schoolwires.com/139620929192030233/lib/139620929192030233/_files/Ellen_Dean_as_villain.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=3 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67kfe5LMS?url=http://livingston.schoolwires.com/139620929192030233/lib/139620929192030233/_files/Ellen_Dean_as_villain.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Isabella Linton]]''': Isabella is seen only in relation to other characters, although some insight into her thoughts and feelings is provided by the chapter, a long letter to Ellen, detailing her arrival at Wuthering Heights after her marriage to Heathcliff. She views Heathcliff romantically, despite Catherine's warnings, and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against Edgar. Heathcliff marries her, but treats her abusively. While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton.
* '''[[Hindley Earnshaw]]''': Catherine's elder brother, Hindley, despises Heathcliff immediately and bullies him throughout their childhood before his father sends him away to college. Hindley returns with his wife, Frances, after Mr Earnshaw dies. He is more mature, but his hatred of Heathcliff remains the same. After Frances's death, Hindley reverts to destructive behaviour and ruins the Earnshaw family by drinking and gambling to excess. Heathcliff beats up Hindley at one point after Hindley fails in his attempt to kill Heathcliff with a pistol.
* '''[[Hareton Earnshaw]]''': The son of Hindley and Frances, raised at first by Nelly but soon by Heathcliff. Nelly works to instill a sense of pride in the Earnshaw heritage (even though Hareton will not inherit Earnshaw property, because Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities, as a way of avenging himself on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph's, and occupies a position similar to a servant at Wuthering Heights, unaware how he has been done out of his inheritance. In appearance he reminds Heathcliff of his aunt, Catherine.
* '''[[Catherine Linton|Cathy Linton]]''': The daughter of Catherine and Edgar, a spirited and strong-willed girl unaware of her parents' history. Edgar is very protective of her and as a result she is eager to discover what lies beyond the confines of the Grange. Although one of the more sympathetic characters of the novel, she is also somewhat snobbish against Hareton and his lack of education.
* '''Linton Heathcliff''': The son of Heathcliff and Isabella. A weak child, his early years are spent with his mother in the south of England. He learns of his father's identity and existence only after his mother dies, when he is twelve. In his selfishness and capacity for cruelty he resembles Heathcliff. Physically he resembles his mother. He marries Cathy Linton because his father, who terrifies him, directs him to do so, and soon after dies from a wasting illness associated with tuberculosis.
* '''Joseph''': A servant at Wuthering Heights for 60 years who is a rigid, self-righteous Christian but lacks any trace of genuine kindness or humanity. He speaks a broad Yorkshire dialect and hates nearly everyone in the novel.
* '''[[Lockwood (Wuthering Heights)|Mr Lockwood]]''': The first narrator, he rents Thrushcross Grange to escape society, but in the end decides society is preferable. He narrates the book until Chapter 4, when the main narrator, Nelly, picks up the tale.
* '''Frances''': Hindley's ailing wife and mother of Hareton Earnshaw. She is described as somewhat silly and is obviously from humble family backgrounds.
* '''Mr and Mrs Earnshaw''': Catherine's and Hindley's father, Mr Earnshaw is the master of Wuthering Heights at the beginning of Nelly's story and is described as an irascible but loving and kind-hearted man. He favours his adopted son, Heathcliff, which causes trouble in the family. In contrast, his wife mistrusts Heathcliff from their first encounter.
* '''Mr and Mrs Linton''': Edgar's and Isabella's parents, they educate their children in a well-behaved and sophisticated way. Mr Linton also serves as the magistrate of Gimmerton, like his son in later years.
* '''Dr Kenneth''': The longtime doctor of Gimmerton and a friend of Hindley's who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. Although not much of his character is known, he seems to be a rough but honest person.
* '''Zillah''': A servant to Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights during the period following Catherine's death. Although she is kind to Lockwood, she doesn't like or help Cathy at Wuthering Heights because of Cathy's arrogance and Heathcliff's instructions.
* '''Mr Green''': Edgar's corruptible lawyer who should have changed Edgar's will to prevent Heathcliff from gaining Thrushcross Grange. But Green changes sides and helps Heathcliff to inherit Grange as his property.

==Gothic novel==
{{Expand-section|date=June 2018}}
[[Ellen Moers]], in ''Literary Women'', developed a feminist theory that connects women writers, including Emily Brontë, with the [[gothic fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' [1976] (London: The Women's Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Earnshaw has been identified by some critics as a type of gothic demon, because she "[[shape-shifts]]" in order to marry Edgar Linton, by assuming a domesticity, which is contrary to her true nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvais, Jennifer. [http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/2006/v/n44/013999ar.html "Domesticity and the Female Demon in Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights"], ''Romanticism on the Net'', Numéro 44, novembre 2006, DOI: 10.7202/013999ar.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff conforms to the "dynamics of the Gothic romance, in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover, suffers from the violence of his feelings, and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Ceron, Christina. [http://lisa.revues.org/3504 "Emily and Charlotte Brontë's Re-reading of the Byronic hero"], ''Revue LISA/LISA e-journal'', Writers, writings, Literary studies, document 2, 9 March 2010, DOI : 10.4000/lisa.3504.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one stage Heathcliff is described as a vampire, and it has been suggested that both he and Catherine are in fact meant to be seen as vampire like personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SIRe5dJULv8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6PnDgenWAhUKbBoKHT6WAFoQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;f=false|title=Demon-lovers and Their Victims in British Fiction|first=Toni|last=Reed|date=30 July 1988|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|accessdate=30 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RdqOAb5NA5wC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVvfG3_-jWAhUG0xoKHfp9BLQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;f=false|title=The Vampire in Nineteenth Century English Literature|first=Carol A.|last=Senf|date=1 February 2013|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|accessdate=30 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

=== 1847 edition ===
The original text, as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847,  is available online in two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/wutheringheights01bron#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Wuthering heights. A novel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/wutheringheights02bron#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Wuthering heights. A novel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was first published together with Anne Brontë's ''Agnes Grey'' in a three-volume format: ''Wuthering Heights'' occupied the first two volumes, while ''Agnes Grey'' made up the third.

===1850 edition===
In 1850, when a second edition of ''Wuthering Heights'' was due, Charlotte Brontë edited the original text, altering punctuation, correcting spelling errors and making Joseph's thick Yorkshire dialect less opaque. Writing to her publisher, W.S. Williams, she mentioned that "It seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant Joseph's speeches; for though, as it stands, it exactly renders the Yorkshire dialect to a Yorkshire ear, yet I am sure Southerns must find it unintelligible; and thus one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them." An essay written by Irene Wiltshire on dialect and speech in the novel examines some of the changes Charlotte made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campuses.fortbendisd.com/campuses/documents/teacher/2009/teacher_20090122_1239_3.pdf Irene Wiltshire: Speech in Wuthering Heights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234803/http://campuses.fortbendisd.com/campuses/documents/teacher/2009/teacher_20090122_1239_3.pdf |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration for locations==
[[File:High Sunderland Hall 1818.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[High Sunderland Hall]] in 1818, shortly before Emily Brontë saw the building.]]
There are several theories about which real building or buildings (if any) may have inspired Wuthering Heights. One common candidate is [[Top Withens]], a ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near the [[Haworth Parsonage]], although its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel.&lt;ref name="inspirations"&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Thompson| title=Wuthering Heights: The Home of the Earnshaws | url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/locations/wuthering-heights#inspirations |date=June 2009 | accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top Withens was first suggested as the model by Ellen Nussey, a friend of [[Charlotte Brontë]], to Edward Morison Wimperis, an artist who was commissioned to illustrate the Brontë sisters' novels in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Thompson| title=The Inspiration for the Wuthering Heights Farmhouse? | url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/locations/top-withens |date=June 2009| accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second possibility is [[High Sunderland Hall]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], now demolished.&lt;ref name="inspirations" /&gt; This Gothic edifice was located near Law Hill, where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838. While it was perhaps grander than Wuthering Heights, the hall had grotesque embellishments of griffins and misshapen nude males similar to those described by Lockwood in Chapter 1 of the novel.

The inspiration for Thrushcross Grange has long been traced to [[Ponden Hall]], near Haworth, which is very small. [[Shibden Hall]], near Halifax, is perhaps more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barnard (2000) ''Emily Brontë''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Jack (1995) Explanatory Notes in Oxford World's Classics edition of ''Wuthering Heights''&lt;/ref&gt; The Thrushcross Grange that Emily describes is rather unusual. It sits within an enormous park, as does Shibden Hall. By comparison, the park at Chatsworth (the home of the Duke of Devonshire) is over two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) long but, as the house sits near the middle, it is no more than a mile and a half (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) from the lodge to the house. Considering that Edgar Linton apparently does not even have a title, this seems unlikely. There is no building close to Haworth that has a park anywhere near this size, but there are a few houses that might have inspired some elements. Shibden Hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel.

== Critical response ==

=== Early reviews (1847–1848) ===
Early reviews of ''Wuthering Heights'' were mixed in their assessment. Whilst most critics at the time recognised the power and imagination of the novel, they were also baffled by the storyline and found the characters prone to savagery and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Joudrey, Thomas J. "'Well, we must be for ourselves in the long run': Selfishness and Sociality in ''Wuthering Heights''." ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'' 70.2 (2015): 165-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1847, at a time when the background of the author was deemed to have an important impact on the story itself, many critics were also intrigued by the authorship of the novels.{{Citation needed|reason= Not in original note. Note was a table of contents|date=March 2017}} [[Henry Chorley]] of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' said that it was a "disagreeable story" and that the "Bells" (Brontës) "seem to affect painful and exceptional subjects".

The ''Atlas'' review called it a "strange, inartistic story," but commented that every chapter seems to contain a "sort of rugged power." ''Atlas'' summarised the novel by writing: "We know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity. There is not in the entire dramatis persona, a single character which is not utterly hateful or thoroughly contemptible&amp;nbsp;... Even the female characters excite something of loathing and much of contempt. Beautiful and loveable in their childhood, they all, to use a vulgar expression, "turn out badly"."&lt;ref name="Publication Stir"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8396278/How-Wuthering-Heights-caused-a-critical-stir-when-first-published-in-1847.html|title=How Wuthering Heights caused a critical stir when first published in 1847|date=22 March 2011|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Graham's Lady Magazine'' wrote "How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors."&lt;ref name="Publication Stir"/&gt;

''The American Whig Review'' wrote "Respecting a book so original as this, and written with so much power of imagination, it is natural that there should be many opinions. Indeed, its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence. We have been taken and carried through a new region, a melancholy waste, with here and there patches of beauty; have been brought in contact with fierce passions, with extremes of love and hate, and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand. This has not been accomplished with ease, but with an ill-mannered contempt for the decencies of language, and in a style which might resemble that of a Yorkshire farmer who should have endeavored to eradicate his provincialism by taking lessons of a London footman. We have had many sad bruises and tumbles in our journey, yet it was interesting, and at length we are safely arrived at a happy conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=amwh;cc=amwh;rgn=full%20text;idno=amwh0007-6;didno=volume;view=image;seq=610;node=amwh0007-6%3A1;page=root;size=100|title=The American Whig Review Volume 0007 Issue 6 (June 1848)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper'' wrote "Wuthering Heights is a strange sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is impossible to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love&amp;nbsp;– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm&amp;nbsp;... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/reviews |title=What critics said about Wuthering Heights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Monthly Magazine'' wrote "Wuthering Heights, by Ellis Bell, is a terrific story, associated with an equally fearful and repulsive spot&amp;nbsp;... Our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to anything to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spot&amp;nbsp;– a perfect misanthropist's heaven."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine'' wrote "This novel contains undoubtedly powerful writing, and yet it seems to be thrown away. Mr. Ellis Bell, before constructing the novel, should have known that forced marriages, under threats and in confinement are illegal, and parties instrumental thereto can be punished. And second, that wills made by young ladies' minors are invalid. The volumes are powerfully written records of wickedness and they have a moral&amp;nbsp;– they show what Satan could do with the law of Entail."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Examiner'' wrote "This is a strange book. It is not without evidences of considerable power: but, as a whole, it is wild, confused, disjointed, and improbable; and the people who make up the drama, which is tragic enough in its consequences, are savages ruder than those who lived before the days of [[Homer]]."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Literary World'' wrote "In the whole story not a single trait of character is elicited which can command our admiration, not one of the fine feelings of our nature seems to have formed a part in the composition of its principal actors. In spite of the disgusting coarsness of much of the dialogue, and the improbabilities of much of the plot, we are spellbound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=W76TqSDM0vYC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Reviews of "Wuthering Heights"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Britannia'' called it a "strangely original" book that depicts "humanity in this wild state." Although mostly hostile, it notes that the book is "illuminated by some gleams of sunshine towards the end which serve to cast a grateful light on the dreary path we have traveled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=38688|title=Wuthering Heights  ::  Free Essays Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G.H. Lewes]], in ''[[Leader Magazine|Leader]]'', shortly after Emily's death, wrote: "Curious enough is to read ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men – turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing their books from a sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! There is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on".&lt;ref&gt;Allott, ''The Brontes: The Critical Heritage'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurence Olivier Merle Oberon Wuthering Heights.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Merle Oberon]] in the 1939 film ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'']]
The earliest known film adaptation of ''Wuthering Heights'' was filmed in England in 1920 and it was directed by [[A. V. Bramble]]. It is unknown if any prints still exist.&lt;ref name="imdb1920"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0011886|title=Wuthering Heights|description=(1920)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous was 1939's ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Merle Oberon]] and directed by [[William Wyler]]. This acclaimed adaptation, like many others, eliminated the second generation's story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literary adaptation. It won the 1939 [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Film and was nominated for the 1939 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

In 1967 the BBC produced a dramatisation starring [[Ian McShane]] and [[Angela Scoular]].

The [[Wuthering Heights (1970 film)|1970 film]] with [[Timothy Dalton]] as Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel, and gained acceptance over the years though it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy's illegitimate half-brother.

In 1978 the BBC produced a five-part TV serialisation of the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Brontë's story.

There is also a 1985 French film adaptation ''[[Hurlevent]]'' by [[Jacques Rivette]].

The 1992 film ''[[Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights]]'' starring [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Juliette Binoche]] is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.

More recent film or TV adaptations include [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s 2009 [[Wuthering Heights (2009 television serial)|two-part drama series]] starring [[Tom Hardy]], [[Charlotte Riley]], [[Sarah Lancashire]], and [[Andrew Lincoln]],&lt;ref name="imdb2009"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1238834|title=Wuthering Heights|description=2009(TV))}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wuthering Heights (2011 film)|2011 film]] starring [[Kaya Scodelario]] and James Howson and directed by [[Andrea Arnold]].

Adaptations which reset the story in a new setting include the [[Wuthering Heights (1953 film)|1953 adaptation]] retitled ''Abismos de Pasion'' directed by Spanish filmmaker [[Luis Buñuel]] set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Buñuel's version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. The ''New York Times'' reviewed a re-release of this film as "an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can take someone else's classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it," noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Brontë.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03EFD91538F934A15751C1A965948260 |title=Abismos de Pasion (1953) Bunuel's Brontë|author=Vincent Canby |date=27 December 1983 |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoshishige Yoshida]]'s [[Wuthering Heights (1988 film)|1988 adaptation]] also has a transposed setting, this time in medieval Japan. In Yoshida's version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. Filipino director Carlos Siguion-Reyna made a film adaptation entitled Hihintayin Kita sa Langit (1991). The screenplay was written by Raquel Villavicencio. It starred [[Richard Gomez]] as Gabriel (Heathcliff) and [[Dawn Zulueta]] as Carmina (Catherine). It became a Filipino film classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manunuri.com/filmography/hihintayin_kita_sa_langit|title=Hihintayin Kita sa Langit (1991) - Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (MPP)|website=www.manunuri.com|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewed [[Wuthering Heights (2003 film)|version]] set in a modern California high school.

The 1966 [[India]]n film ''[[Dil Diya Dard Liya]]'' is based upon this novel. The film is directed by [[Abdul Rashid Kardar]] and [[Dilip Kumar]]. The film stars the thespian [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Pran (actor)|Pran]], [[Rehman (actor)|Rehman]], [[Shyama]] and [[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]]. The music is by the legendary composer [[Naushad]]. Although it did not fare as well as other movies of Dilip Kumar, it was well received by critics.

The novel has been popular in opera and theatre, including operas written by [[Bernard Herrmann]], [[Carlisle Floyd]], and [[Frédéric Chaslin]] (most cover only the first half of the book) and a musical by [[Bernard J. Taylor]].

In 2011, a [[graphic novel]] version was published by Classical Comics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalcomics.com/ |title=Classical Comics |publisher=Classical Comics |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stays close to the original novel. It was adapted by Scottish writer [[Sean Michael Wilson]] and hand painted by comic book veteran artist John M Burns. This version received a nomination for the Stan Lee Excelsior Awards, voted by pupils from 170 schools in the United Kingdom.

== Works inspired ==

[[Kate Bush]]'s song "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]" is most likely the best-known creative work inspired by Brontë's story that is not properly an "adaptation". Bush wrote and released the song when she was 18 and chose it as the lead single in her debut album (despite the record company preferring another track as the lead single). It was primarily inspired by the [[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Olivier–Oberon film version]], which deeply affected Bush in her teenage years. The song is sung from Catherine's point of view as she pleads at Heathcliff's window to be admitted. It uses quotations from Catherine, both in the chorus ("Let me in! I'm so cold!") and the verses, with Catherine's admitting she had "bad dreams in the night". Critic Sheila Whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with Cathy's dementia, and that Bush's high register has both "childlike qualities in its purity of tone" and an "underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours".Singer Pat Benatar also released the song in 1980 on the "Crimes of Passion" album. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Too much too young: popular music, age and gender |last=Whiteley |first=Sheila |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |location= |isbn=0-415-31029-6 |page=9 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


''[[Wind &amp; Wuthering]]'' (1976) by English rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] alludes to the Brontë novel not only in the album's title but also in the titles of two of its tracks, "Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers..." and "...In That Quiet Earth". Both titles refer to the closing lines in the novel.

Songwriter [[Jim Steinman]] said that he wrote the song "[[It's All Coming Back To Me Now]]" "while under the influence of ''Wuthering Heights''". He said that the song was "about being enslaved and obsessed by love" and compared it to "Heathcliffe digging up Kathy's corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight".&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;{{cite web |work=JimSteinman.com |title=Jim Steinman on "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/backtome.htm |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Cath...|Cath]]" by [[indie rock]] band [[Death Cab for Cutie]] was inspired by ''Wuthering Heights''.

[[Maryse Condé]]'s ''Windward Heights'' (''La migration des coeurs'', published in 1995; English translation published in 1998) is a reworking of ''Wuthering Heights'' set in [[Cuba]] and [[Guadaloupe]] at the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tepper |first1=Anderson |title=Windward Heights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/05/bib/990905.rv103554.html |publisher=New York Times |date=5 September 1999 |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Condé stated she intended as an homage to Brontë.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248/ |last=Wolff |first=Rebecca |title=Maryse Condé |publisher=BOMB Magazine |accessdate=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101132353/http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248 |archive-date=1 November 2016 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura Minae]]'s ''[[A True Novel]]'' (''Honkaku shosetsu'', published in 2002 by Shinchosha; English translation by [[Juliet Winters Carpenter]] published by Other Press in 2013) is inspired by ''Wuthering Heights'' and might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/books/review/a-true-novel-by-minae-mizumura.html?_r=0 |last=Chira |first=Susan |title=Strange Moors: 'A True Novel' by Minae Mizuma |publisher=The New York Times |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jane Urquhart]]'s ''Changing Heaven'', the novel ''Wuthering Heights'', as well as the ghost of Emily Brontë, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.

The song "[[Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)]]" by the band [[Marillion]] includes the line "Like the girl in the novel in the wind on the moors".

The song "Emily" by [[Folk Music|folk]] artist [[Billie Marten]] is written from Brontë's perspective. Marten wrote the song while studying ''Wuthering Heights''.

Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]]'s ecogothic novel ''Perdita'' (2013) was deeply influenced by ''Wuthering Heights,'' namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Douglas, [http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2014/02/the-eco-gothic-hilary-scharpers-perdita.html "The Eco-Gothic: Hilary Scharper's Perdita"], ''Critics at Large'', 19
