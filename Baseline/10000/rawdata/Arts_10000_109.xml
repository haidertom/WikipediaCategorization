'''18th-century French art''' was dominated by the [[Baroque]], [[Rocaille]] and [[Neoclassicism in France|neoclassical]] movements.

==History&lt;!--'French neoclassicism' and 'French Neoclassicism' redirct here--&gt;==
In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in September 1715 led to a period of licentious freedom commonly called the [[Régence]].  The heir to Louis XIV, his great grandson [[Louis XV of France]], was only 5 years old; for the next seven years France was ruled by the regent [[Philippe II of Orléans]].  Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722.  Painting turned toward "fêtes galantes", theater settings and the female nude.  Painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[François Boucher]]. One of the best places in the UK to see examples of French visual and decorative arts of the Rococo and neoclassical periods is in [[Wallace Collection|the Wallace Collection]], a free national gallery in London.

The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration (although already apparent at the end of the last reign) was lighter: pastels and wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding and fewer brocades; shells and garlands and occasional Chinese subjects predominated.  Rooms were more intimate.   After the return to Versailles, many of the baroque rooms of Louis XIV were redesigned.  The official etiquette was also simplified and the notion of privacy was expanded: the king himself retreated from the official bed at night and conversed in private with his mistress.

The latter half of the 18th century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the [[French language]] was the lingua franca of the European courts.  The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, like [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork.  Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[portrait]] and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable.

The writer [[Denis Diderot]] wrote a number of times on the annual [[Paris Salon|Salons]] of the Académie of painting and sculpture and his comments and criticisms are a vital document on the arts of this period.

One of Diderot's favorite painters was [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].  Although often considered [[kitsch]] by today's standards, his paintings of domestic scenes reveal the importance of [[Sentimentality|Sentimentalism]] in the European arts of the period (as also seen in the works of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Samuel Richardson]].)

One also finds in this period a kind of ''[[Pre-romanticism]]''.  [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect.  So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' (of [[André Le Nôtre]]) to the ''English garden'', which emphasized (artificially) wild and irrational nature.  One also finds in some of these gardens curious ruins of temples called [[Folly|follies]].

The middle of the 18th century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography.  In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques-Louis David]] who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile; his subject matter often involved classical history (the death of Socrates, Brutus).  The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the 17th century.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jacob4Chairs.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A suite of Louis XVI giltwood chairs made circa 1775 by [[Georges Jacob]].]] --&gt;

The [[Louis XVI style]] of furniture (once again already present in the previous reign) tended toward circles and ovals in chair backs; chair legs were grooved; Greek inspired iconography was used as decoration.

'''French neoclassicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would greatly contribute to the monumentalism of the [[French revolution]], as typified in the structures [[Eglise de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]] church (begun in 1763 and finished in 1840) which is in the form of a [[Greek temple]] and the mammoth [[Panthéon]] (1764–1812) which today houses the tombs of great Frenchmen.  The rationalism and simplicity of classical architecture was seen &amp;mdash; in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] &amp;mdash; as the antithesis of the backward-looking [[Gothic art|Gothic]].

The Greek and Roman subject matters were also often chosen to promote the values of republicanism.  One also finds paintings glorifying the heroes and martyrs of the French revolution, such as David's painting of the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]].

[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], a student of David's who was also influenced by [[Raphael]] and [[John Flaxman]], would maintain the precision of David's style, while also exploring other mythological (Oedipus and the sphinx, Jupiter and Thetis) and oriental (the Odalesques) subjects in the spirit of [[Romanticism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">'''Alpana''' or '''alpona''' ({{lang-bn|আল্পনা}}) refers to colourful motifs, sacred art or painting done with hands and paint which is mainly a paste of rice and flour on auspicious occasions in [[Bengal]].&lt;ref name="hindu27122017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Reviving-a-vanishing-folk-art-form-in-Bengal/article16083431.ece|title=Reviving a vanishing folk art form in Bengal|date=27 December 2016|work=The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu Group|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Alpana is derived from the Sanskrit ''alimpana'', which means 'to plaster' or 'to coat with'.  Traditionally, it was drawn by the women of the house before sunset. It is also a folk art in Bengal.

==Materials used to draw an Alpana==
Traditionally in Bengal , alpana is strictly white since the liquid paste used for alpana is rice powder mixed in water. Nowadays there is somewhat change in materials. Some fabric colours are used along with some glue to give some long life of the alpana. Alpana is although generally white some green, red forms also drawn. Traditionally the green colouration done by tree leaves and red colour by sindur . It is also done with the cotton thread soaked in the liquid paste.

==Uses of Alpana==
The art is known by different names in various parts of India and its use varies from region to region. The most common type of alpana all around India is [[Rangoli]], which uses colored sand to draw a design. The artwork is mainly done by women. They are conscious of the changing moods of the seasons and their creativity thus marks the changing cycle of the year.

Circular alpana is used as a holy pedestal during festivals such as the  Bengal,Saraswati puja (also referred to as [[vasant panchami]]) in Bengal and the Festival of Lights ([[Diwali]]). Items drawn with the technique include the sun, swastika, a rice stem, an owl, a ladder, a plough, the footprints of the goddess [[Lakshmi]], a fish, [[betel]], a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]], shankhalata (a snake)and some times just some abstract art to look beautiful .

[[File:Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret MET DP102925.jpg|thumb|The altarpiece]]
The '''''Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret''''' is an autographed 1434 sculpture in [[Carrara marble]] by the Italian artist [[Andrea da Giona]], now in the collection of [[The Cloisters]] in [[New York City]]. It was commissioned by the Knights of Malta, a band of violent Christian sailors preoccupied with defending Spain from Muslim invasion.&lt;ref name="w12"&gt;Wixom, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The carving is in the late [[International Gothic]] style, as evidenced by its folds of draperies, lush folidates, and the heavily idealised facial types of the main saints.&lt;ref name="w12" /&gt;

[[Christ in Majesty]] is at the center, flanked by the Virgin Mary and the angel [[Gabriel]], with other angels playing musical instruments. The four [[Evangelism|Evangelists]] are placed at each corner. Inscriptions below the central panel read &lt;small&gt;"HOC OPUS FECIT MAGISTER AND[R]EAS DA GIONA MCCCCXXXIIII" (This work was made by Master Andrea from Giona 1434).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/471909 Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">'''Avvisi''' ({{IPA-it|avˈviːzo|lang}}; plural: ''avvisi'') were hand-written [[newsletters]] used to convey political, military, and economic [[news]] quickly and efficiently throughout [[Europe]], and more specifically [[Italy]], during the [[early modern period|early modern era (1500-1700)]].  In the beginning avvisi were very similar to letters written from one dignitary to another, but diverged from such letters in the sixteenth century with more standardized practices.  Avvisi can be divided into two categories: 'public' avvisi and 'secret' avvisi, though each copy was often written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,214,216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the word '''[[wikt:avviso|avviso]]''' translates to ''notice'', ''warning'', ''advice'', or ''announcement''.

==Origin==
The avvisi found their origins, and peaked, in the early modern Italian world - primarily Rome and Venice.  The popularity and distribution of the avvisi was driven by each court's desire to know what the opposing and even the allied courts are up to.  News networks spread all across Europe, but the avviso itself was generally created in either Rome or Venice, with the rest of Europe simply consuming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Importance==
Avvisi influenced many aspects of the early modern world including public opinion, political battles, the nature of propaganda, careers, and historical records.

'''Public Opinion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi helped to develop public opinion by informing, organizing, and providing a voice for the public.  They allowed the general public to learn of the secret dealings of the nation's leaders, form a response, and then have that response actually be heard by their fellow citizens - essentially making them new players in the game of politics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Politics and War'''&lt;br /&gt;
Though officially renounced by many leaders at the time, avvisi were then used by those very same leaders to wage their political campaigns against one another.  Destruction and [[censorship]] of avvisi was selective, demonstrating that the authorities recognized the importance of spreading news but would have preferred to spread only news that was of benefit to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Competition quickly led to avvisi being used as propaganda devices both as a machine of war{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and in attempts to turn the mob on their own country.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict as a result of avvisi being used as propaganda is certainly not out of the question, either with the public or between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further the avvisi provided the public with political power rarely seen before in the form of 'secret' information that could have allowed them to have influence upon the courts,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and government decisions.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"/&gt;  A minority of people, such as [[Paolo Sarpi]], believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of avvisi and make full use of publication to combat enemy publication.  An example of this includes several pamphlets written by Sarpi in defense of Venice's rights over the Adriatic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Finances and Wealth'''&lt;br /&gt;
Creation and distribution of avvisi required writers, those who can deliver the news, and those who can grant the information that makes the news and this provided many people with jobs, earning them money through standard means.  In addition, invaluable secrets provided by the avvisi could be used in extortion or allowing individuals to influence prices at market.  Those who used the avvisi in this way held the opinion that the information provided by avvisi could not be stopped and it was thus better to capitalize on it.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37,38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi led to a realization of the importance of the after-effects of historical records, whether they be true or not.  [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s work is an excellent example of this, as he states that he may cause more damage dead (through his writing) than he ever had alive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Types==
;Public avvisi
Public avvisi were news letters that were available to anyone who wished to travel to a distribution center in a city.  They were limited to generic, often harmless facts.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,217,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Secret avvisi
Secret avvisi were news letters available to a restricted audience, much akin to duplicated personal letters.  Their content could be considerably more harmful than the public counterpart, as it could include opinions of top officials and the discussions from secret meetings.  This form of communication often had a very specific purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Distribution==
Distribution of the avvisi began with the sources of information.  Reporters (newsletter writers, menanti, reportisti, gazzettieri) had networks of contacts filtering information from chancelleries, Catholic churches, Protestant churches, foreign embassies,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and shops.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39,41. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information was gathered and put together individually or at a [[Scrittoria]] (writer's workshop).  The avvisi would then be distributed by regular news services and organized postal service networks.  Whether newsletters were sent weekly, bi-weekly, or annually depended on the type of news and the writer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,219,224.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the public avvisi were presented the news would quickly spread by word of mouth among the illiterate, no longer relying on the avvisi reporters.  The range of information presented within avvisi was very broad, including countries such as France, Italy, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38,42. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporters==
Writers of avvisi received very little recognition which, quite often, was exactly how they wanted it.  Fear of censorship kept writers from signing work under their own name - for in the early modern era censorship could mean death.  Mutual bonds of trust developed between certain reporters and clients once they found they could trust each other to provide reliable information without any trouble.  The quality of avvisi may fall under question for numerous reasons; the recopying of documents, the translation of documents, and the insertion of opinions for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,219,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Censorship of avvisi began with [[Pope Pius V]]'s campaign, beginning in 1570CE.  Writers caught distributing what the Catholic Church determined to be defamatory were punished severely - several examples of punishments include death, imprisonment, and torture (sometimes to death).  

The harsh punishments did not prevent writers from continuing in their task, though they were forced to use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The avvisi were blamed for causing disputes by church officials and writers.  However, institutions that condemned avvisi found they could do nothing to quell the hand-written newsletters and began to use them to their own benefit, even with bans still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 214,215,217&lt;/ref&gt;  

Religious leaders were not alone in banning newsletters - more secular leaders also laid down limitations and prohibitions, including Venice's [[Council of Ten]] who held bans until at least 1567.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A popular reporter, [[Paolo Sarpi]], was a minority in his time for holding the belief that the spread of information could not be stopped so censorship was a waste of resources.  Sarpi believed that the only way to combat the enemy's newsletters is for the government to have their own avviso.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Printed vs. Written==
It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that printed avvisi became more common, and even then Venice and Rome abstained from print.  Due to restrictions from censorship on printed works, a sense of urgency, and a desire for personalization hand written avvisi would not be easily replaced by the printing press.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  

Printed works were produced much more slowly and as a result the public would lose interest in the topic before it came to print.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 48. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Further, printed avvisi were less robust in an effort to avoid censors and cut editing time.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Tracy Bad Day at Black Rock Color Still 1955.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spencer Tracy]] and [[John Ericson]] in ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]
In late 1945, one-armed John J. Macreedy ([[Spencer Tracy]]) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth ([[John Ericson]]), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David ([[Lee Marvin]]). Later, Reno Smith ([[Robert Ryan]]) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a [[Japanese-American]], was [[Japanese American internment|interned during World War II]].

Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn ([[Dean Jagger]]), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie ([[Walter Brennan]]), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz ([[Anne Francis]]), rents Macreedy a [[Jeep]]. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble ([[Ernest Borgnine]]) tries to run him off the road.

Macreedy decides to leave town and goes to the garage to again rent the jeep from Liz; but she, having been confronted by Smith earlier, denies him the vehicle and drives away to avoid conversation about the strange goings-on in the town.  Macreedy then sits down outside the garage to consider his situation.  Smith comes by, ostensibly to fill his car with gas.  Smith asks and Macreedy discloses that he lost his left arm [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]]. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] the day after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but failed the physical.

Macreedy tries to telephone the [[state police]] from Doc Velie's office, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his [[hearse]] to leave town. Hector rips out the distributor cap and spark plug wires. Macreedy goes to Hastings' ([[Russell Collins]]) telegraph office and writes a [[telegraphy|telegram]] addressed to the state police. At the town diner, Trimble picks a fight with Macreedy, but Macreedy uses martial arts to beat him up. Macreedy tells Smith that he knows Smith killed Komoko and that he was too cowardly to do it alone, so he involved Hector, Pete, and Coley; Macreedy also warns that when Smith's hoods eventually realize they're being played by Smith one of them will turn against him.

[[File:Bad-Time-at-Honda-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Robert Fawcett]] illustrated ''[[The American Magazine]]'' printing of "Bad Time at Honda", a 1947 short story by Howard Breslin that was adapted for the film ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]

When Macreedy goes to the hotel lobby, Smith and his henchmen are already there, as are Doc Velie and Sheriff Horn. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper, but Macreedy snatches it away and discovers that it is his own unsent telegram. Macreedy and Doc Velie demand that Sheriff Horn do something. When Horn tries, Smith just takes away his sheriff's badge and pins it on Hector. Hector tears up the telegram form.
After Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy reveals that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Smith's attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him.  Macreedy finally reveals why he is there: Komoko's son [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|died in combat]] while saving Macreedy's life. Macreedy intended to give his posthumous medal to Komoko.  In turn, Macreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure there was no water there. Komoko had dug a well and found water. After Smith was turned down for enlistment after Pearl Harbor, he and the other men spent the day drinking, then decided to scare Komoko. The old man barricaded himself inside his home, but the men set the place on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot him.

Pete sets in motion a plan, involving Liz and Doc Velie, to help Macreedy escape under cover of darkness. Hector is standing guard outside the hotel; Pete lures him into the hotel office, where Doc Velie knocks him out. Liz drives Macreedy out of town in her Jeep, but stops in a canyon. Macreedy realizes he has been betrayed. When Smith starts shooting at him, Macreedy hides behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy's warning. Smith tells her that she has to die along with the rest of his accomplices. He shoots her in the back as she runs away. Macreedy finds a bottle and fills it with [[gasoline]], creating a [[Molotov cocktail]]. When Smith climbs down for a better shot, Macreedy lights and throws it, setting Smith on fire.

Macreedy drives into town with the injured Smith and Liz's body. The state police are called in. As Macreedy is leaving, Doc Velie requests Komoko's medal to help Black Rock heal. Macreedy gives it to him just before boarding the train.

==Production==
[[Nicholas Schenck]], president of [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Incorporated]], MGM's parent company at the time, nearly did not allow the picture to be made because he felt that the story was subversive. The film's producer, [[Dore Schary]], wanted Spencer Tracy for the leading role. Concerned that Tracy might not accept, Schary ordered the script changed so that Macreedy was a one-armed man. He concluded that no actor would turn down the chance to play a character with a handicap. Screenwriter [[Millard Kaufman]], a World War II Marine platoon leader at age 25 thought Tracy too old for the role of a former platoon leader&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

As John Wayne had recently made a film called ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' the producers feared that calling their film ''Bad Day at Honda'' would confuse filmgoers into thinking they had already seen it.  Kaufman whilst location scouting in Arizona, came upon a post office and gas station collectively known as Black Rock. Kaufman telephoned Dore Schary to ask, "Why don’t we call it Black Rock? And do it in California?”&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before shooting began, an indecisive Tracy tried to back out of the picture. Schary made clear that he was willing to sue the actor if he quit the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Andersen|Andersen, Christopher P.]], p.243&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Osborne]] of the television network [[Turner Classic Movies]], in the introduction to the film's airing on its weekly segment ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', Tracy, weighed down by his growing alcoholism, refused to give MGM an answer. In order to close the deal, according to Osborne, an MGM executive contacted Tracy shortly before filming was to begin and said, "Don't worry, Mr. Tracy, a copy of the script has been sent to [[Alan Ladd]] and he has agreed to do the picture." The next day, Tracy committed to ''Bad Day at Black Rock''. Ladd, however, apparently never even saw the script. It turned out to be Tracy's last film for MGM, with the exception of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), for which Tracy supplied the narration. 

Preview audiences reacted negatively to the film's original opening sequence. A revised one, showing the speeding train rushing at the camera, replaced it. The shot was taken from a helicopter as it flew away from the moving train. The film was run in reverse to create the opening shot.

''Bad Day at Black Rock'' was filmed in [[Lone Pine, California]] and the nearby [[Alabama Hills]], one of hundreds of movies that have been filmed in the area since 1920. The "town" of Black Rock was built for the film. Today nothing remains of the set, erected one mile north  ({{coord|36|38|2.84|N|118|2|23.74|W|scale:20000_type:city_region:US|display=inline,title}}) of the [[Lone Pine Station, California|Lone Pine station]], a stop on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [http://users.innercite.com/kj6ko/railroad.htm Jawbone Branch], which served the northern [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Owens Valley]].

==Reception==
According to MGM records the film earned $1,966,000 in the US and Canada and $1,822,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $947,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine's reviewer wrote: "Considerable excitement is whipped up in this suspense drama, and fans who go for tight action will find it entirely satisfactory. Besides telling a yarn of tense suspense, the picture is concerned with a social message on civic complacency."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788838.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'']. Film review, 1954. Last accessed; February 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' also liked it, writing, "Slowly, through a process of guarded discourse, which director John Sturges has built up by patient, methodical pacing of his almost completely male cast, an eerie light begins to glimmer&amp;nbsp;... Quite as interesting as the drama, which smacks of being contrived, are the types of masculine creatures paraded in this film. Mr. Tracy is sturdy and laconic as a war veteran with a lame arm (which does not hamper him, however, in fighting judo style). Mr. Ryan is angular and vicious as the uneasy king-pin of the town, and Walter Brennan is cryptic and caustic as the local mortician with a streak of spunk. Ernest Borgnine as a potbellied bully (he was Sgt. "Fatso" Judson in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''), Dean Jagger as a rum-guzzling sheriff, Lee Marvin as a dimwitted tough, John Ericson as a nervous hotel clerk and Russell Collins as a station-master are all good, too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9E01EFDB1F3FE035A65751C0A9649C946492D6CF&amp;oref=slogin Crowther, Bosley].

Despite a storyline she called "crudely melodramatic", [[Pauline Kael]] heaped praise on the film for its direction and cinematography, calling it "a very superior example of motion picture craftsmanship".&lt;ref name="Kael"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Kael|title=5001 Nights at the Movies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4LzeUZ03vQC|year=2011|origyear=1991|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-250-03357-4|pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bilge Ebiri]] considers the film to be "one of the greatest films ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=[[Bilge Ebiri]]|user=BilgeEbiri|number=821567879892140032|date=17 January 2017|title=This is one of the greatest films ever made.

===Cultural references===
The 1980s television program, ''[[The A-Team]]'', had a Season 1 [[word play]] title episode called "Black Day at Bad Rock", with a somewhat similar theme of an isolated California desert town, only this one a present-day town threatened by an oncoming [[biker gang]] out to free its leader and avenge his imprisonment by destroying the town.

One of the cartoon episodes in the ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection]]'' is titled ''[[Bad Day at Cat Rock]]'', a pun on the film's title. The cartoon bears no resemblance to the film's plot.

}}'''Black''' is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[visible spectrum|visible]] [[light]]. It is an achromatic color, literally a color  without [[hue]], like [[white]] and [[gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/achromatic+color|title=Definition of ''achromatic''|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used [[symbol]]ically or [[figurative language|figuratively]] to represent darkness, while [[white]] represents light.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black [[ink]] is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read. For the same reason, black text on a white screen  is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"&gt;Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' (2009), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[color printing]] it is [[CMYK shade model|used along with]] the [[subtractive shade|subtractive]] [[primary shade|primaries]] [[cyan]], [[yellow]], and [[magenta]], in order to help produce the darkest colors.

Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance, good and evil, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] versus [[Age of Enlightenment]].   Since the [[Middle Ages]], black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in [[neolithic]] cave paintings.  In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

In the [[Roman Empire]], it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with [[death]], evil, witches and magic.  According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;105–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''blæc'' ("black, dark", ''also'', "ink"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' ("burned"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' ("to burn, gleam, shine, flash"), from base *''bhel-'' ("to shine"), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' ("ink"), [[Old High German]] ''blach'' ("black"), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' ("dark"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' ("to burn"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bläck'' ("ink"). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' ("to blaze, glow, burn"), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' ("to burn, scorch").

The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity.  ''Kuanos''' could mean both dark blue and black.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans had two words for black:  ''ater'' was a flat, dull black, while ''niger'' was a brilliant, saturated black.  ''Ater'' has vanished from the vocabulary, but ''niger'' was the source of the country name ''Nigeria''&lt;ref&gt;"African nation, named for the river Niger, mentioned by that name 1520s (Leo Africanus), probably an alteration (by influence of Latin niger "black") of a local Tuareg name, egereou n-igereouen, from egereou "big river, sea" + n-igereouen, plural of that word. Translated in Arabic as nahr al-anhur "river of rivers." (Online Etymological Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;  the English word ''Negro'' and the word for "black" in most modern [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]]: ''noir''; [[Spanish language|Spanish and Portuguese]]: ''negro''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''nero'' ).

[[Old High German]] also had two words for black: ''swartz'' for dull black and ''blach'' for a luminous black.  These are parallelled in [[Middle English]] by the terms ''swart'' for dull black and ''blaek'' for luminous black. ''Swart'' still survives as the word ''swarthy'', while ''blaek'' became the modern English ''black''.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

In heraldry, the word used for the black color is [[sable (heraldry)|sable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0-906670-44-6|pages=294, 343}}&lt;/ref&gt; named for the black fur of the [[sable]], an animal.

Black was one of the first colors used in art.  The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of [[manganese oxide]].&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

===Ancient history===
For the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of [[Anubis]], the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black [[jackal]], and offered protection against evil to the dead.

For the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river [[Acheron]], whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to [[Tartarus]], the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of [[Hades]], the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black [[ebony]] throne.

Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making [[black-figure pottery]] and later [[red figure pottery]], using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social hierarchy of [[ancient Rome]], purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In [[Latin]], the word for black, ''ater'' and to darken, ''atere'',  were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words "atrocious" and "atrocity".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', New York: World Publishing Company (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a ''toga pulla'', to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the ''hora nigra'', the black hour.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, [[Nótt]], who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the [[raven]]. They believed that [[Odin]], the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassical history===
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the 12th and 13th centuries====
In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by [[Benedictine]] monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the [[Cistercian]] monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, "of death and sin," while white represented "purity, innocence and all the virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The [[black knight]] in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;86–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black [[ink]], invented in China, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read.  It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of [[printing]].    A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created out of [[soot]], [[turpentine]] and [[walnut oil]]. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints.  Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 14th and 15th centuries====
In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly [[scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]] cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the [[sable]]. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the [[marten]] family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe.  It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of [[sumptuary laws]] in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from [[Venice]] and the peacock blue fabrics from [[Florence]] were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau,  Noir – HIstoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]], younger brother of King [[Charles VI of France]]. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King [[Richard II]] (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]]. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;121–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

====In the 16th and 17th centuries====
While black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. [[John Calvin]], [[Philip Melanchthon]] and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Protestant Netherlands, [[Rembrandt]] used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like [[Rubens]], went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new [[Baroque]] churches of the [[Counter-Reformation]] were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–51&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of [[witchcraft]].  People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a [[Black Mass]] or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their [[familiar spirit]]s, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In medieval [[Flanders]], in a ceremony called ''Kattenstoet,'' black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of [[Ypres]] to ward off witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious [[Salem witch trials]] in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a "black thing with a blue cap,"  and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SALEM.HTM|title=The Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692|first=Prof.|last=Linder|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/calef/calef.html |title=More Wonders Of The Invisible World |publisher=Salem.lib.virginia.edu |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 18th and 19th centuries====
In the 18th century, during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the [[French Revolution]], black again became the dominant color.

Black was the color of the [[industrial revolution]], largely fueled by [[coal]], and later by oil. Thanks to coal [[smoke]], the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned [[black carbon|black]].  By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was "commonly called 'the [[Black Country]]'”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Upton|title=And so it came to pass...|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/lifestyle/came-pass-3920518|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist [[Gustave Doré]].

A different kind of black was an important part of the [[romantic movement]] in literature. Black was the color of [[Melancholia|melancholy]], the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.

The invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.

Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. [[James McNeil Whistler]] made the color the subject of his most famous painting, ''Arrangement in grey and black number one''  (1871), better known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: "Reject black," [[Paul Gauguin]] said, "and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri.  Écrits d'un sauvage''. Textes choisis (1892–1903). Editions D. Guerin, Paris, 1974, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Édouard Manet]] used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter [[Berthe Morisot]] was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy;  he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect.&lt;ref&gt;Steffano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] quoted the French impressionist [[Pissarro]] telling him, "Manet is stronger than us all – he made light with black."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam, ''Matisse on Art'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: "What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent van Gogh]] used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.

In the late 19th century, black also became the color of [[anarchism]]. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 20th and 21st centuries====
In the 20th century, black was the color of Italian and German [[fascism]].  (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], a member of the [[Suprematist]] movement, created the ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, "The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality&amp;nbsp;... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also appreciated by [[Henri Matisse]]. "When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black," he said in 1945. "Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction&amp;nbsp;... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam (1995), ''Matisse on Art'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as [[Juliette Greco]], and by some members of the [[Beat Movement]] in New York and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]] and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as ''[[The Wild One]]'', with [[Marlon Brando]]. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the [[punk subculture]] [[punk fashion]], and the [[goth subculture]]. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by [[Victorian era]] mourning dress.

In men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, [[John F. Kennedy]] was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer [[Coco Chanel]], who published a drawing of a simple black dress in ''Vogue'' magazine. She famously said, "A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves."&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt;  Other designers contributed to the trend of the [[little black dress]]. The Italian designer [[Gianni Versace]] said, "Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance," and French designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] said, "black is the liaison which connects art and fashion.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt; One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and was worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The American [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of [[African Americans]]. It developed into the [[Black Power]] movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan "[[Black is Beautiful]]".

In the 1990s, the [[Black Standard]] became the banner of several [[Islamic extremist]], [[jihadist]] groups. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

==Science==

===Physics===
{{Main article|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
In the [[visible spectrum]], black is the absorption of all colors.

Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no [[visible light]] reaches the eye. [[Pigment]]s or [[dye]]s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[primary colors]].

In [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.

In elementary science, far [[ultraviolet]] light is called "[[black light]]" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].

On January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]'s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the then darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflected only 0.045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm|title=Nanotubes yield the blackest black|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, the current darkest material known is claimed to be [[Vantablack]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 29 February 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Jonathan |title= Can an artist ever really own a colour? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2016/feb/29/anish-kapoor-vantablack-paint| date= 29 February 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 5 November 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last= Lee |first= Linda |title= Gazing Into the Void: What You Can Do With Vantablack, the Darkest Material Ever Made |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/garden/what-you-can-do-with-vantablack-the-darkest-material-ever-made.html?_r=0| date= 5 November 2014|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location=New York City| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see [[Solar thermal collector]]).

Absorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

====Pigments====
The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were [[charcoal]], [[red ocher]] and [[yellow ocher]]. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with [[resin]].&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.
* '''Vine black''' was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian [[Vitruvius]], the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of [[indigo]].

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: "...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cennini also noted that "There is [[peach black|another black]] which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"/&gt; Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the [[peach]], [[cherry]] or [[apricot]]. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with [[gum arabic]] or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The [[Inuit]] of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of [[Pinniped|seals]] to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned [[coconut]]s to produce their pigment.
* [[Lamp black]] was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos.  The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance:  "... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the bottom of the pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick. Wait a bit. take the pan and brush this pigment (that is, this smoke) onto paper or into a pot with something. And it is not necessary to mull or grind it because it is a very fine pigment. Re-fill the lamp with the oil and put it under the pan like this several times and, in this way, make as much of it as is necessary."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"/&gt; This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the [[Ajanta Caves]], and as dye in ancient Japan.&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"/&gt;
* [[Ivory black]], also known as [[bone char]], was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.
* [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars black]] is a black pigment made of synthetic [[iron oxides]]. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from [[Mars]], the god of war and patron of iron.

====Dyes====

Good-quality black [[dyes]] were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees;  usually the [[walnut]], [[chestnut]], or certain [[oak]] trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the [[Oak apple]] or '''gall-nut'''.  The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the [[larva]] of certain kinds of [[gall wasp]] in the family Cynipidae.&lt;ref name=cranshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Cranshaw|first=Whitney|title=Garden Insects of North America|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-09560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dye was very expensive;  a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye.  The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from [[Poland]], eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa.  Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2008), ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;112–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the [[logwood tree]], or [[Haematoxylum campechianum]], which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]], that is native to southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | ''Haematoxylum campechianum'' | 18172 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern nation of [[Belize]] grew from 17th century [[Kingdom of England|English]] logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is [[Nigrosin]], a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of [[nitrobenzene]], [[aniline]] and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a [[copper]] or [[iron]] [[catalyst]]. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.&lt;ref&gt;Green F. J. (1990), ''The Sigma-Aldrich Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Indicators'', pp.&amp;nbsp;513–15. Milwaukee:&amp;nbsp;Aldrich. {{ISBN|0-941633-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inks====

The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as [[graphite]] ground with water and applied with an [[ink brush]]. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern [[inkstick]] have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the [[Warring States period]]. They were produced from [[soot]], usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with [[animal glue]]. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of [[Chinese brush painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=二、墨的發展史|first=玫芬|last=蔡|publisher=National Chang-Hua Hall of Social Education|url=http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|trans-title=Second, the ink history of the development|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041126130717/http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|archivedate=November 26, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India ink]] (or '''Indian ink''' in [[British English]]) is a black [[ink]] once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for [[drawing]], especially when inking [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in [[India]] since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called ''masi''. In India, the black color of the ink came from [[bone char]], [[tar]], [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and other substances.&lt;ref&gt;"India ink." in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gottsege&gt;{{cite book

The Ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called ''[[atramentum]] librarium''.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith (editor) [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], 1870
[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/index.html (text).]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name came from the Latin word ''atrare'', which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word ''atrocious''.) It was usually made, like India ink, from [[soot]], although one variety, called ''atramentum elephantinum'', was made by burning the ivory of elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin, Ruth Siddall, ''Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary of Historical Pigments'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. [[Iron gall ink]] (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black [[ink]] made from [[iron]] salts and [[tannic acid]]s from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing [[ink]] in [[Europe]], from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.

===Astronomy===
* A [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] where gravity prevents anything, including [[light]], from escaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Although a black hole itself is black, infalling material forms an [[accretion disk]], which is one of brightest types of object in the universe.
* [[Black-body radiation]] refers to the radiation coming from a body at a given temperature where all incoming energy (light) is converted to heat.
* Black sky refers to the appearance of space as one emerges from Earth's atmosphere.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Why the night sky and space are black – Olbers' paradox====
The fact that [[outer space]] is black is sometimes called [[Olbers' paradox]]. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]], who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, although the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the [[Doppler effect]], and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question52.html|title=Why is space black?|website=starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].

The nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This phenomenon also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere.

==Culture==
In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things;  and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise.  It is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] seized power from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red.  Only when the [[Han Dynasty]] appeared in 206 BC was red restored as the imperial color.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp.&amp;nbsp;223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese and Japanese character for black (''kuro'' in Japanese), can, depending upon the context, also mean dark or evil.

In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death.  Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322054855/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |archivedate=March 22, 2013 |df=mdy }} Exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum on color in Japanese art and design,&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan in the 10th and 11th century, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune.  It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/blacks.html |website=Webexhibits.org |series=Pigments through the ages |title=Intro to the blacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

In Indonesia black is associated with depth, the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand.  When black is combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, pp.&amp;nbsp;224–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political movements===
'''Anarchism''' is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The [[Anarchist symbolism|symbols of anarchism]] was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name="blackflame"&gt;Michael Schmidt and [[Lucien van der Walt]], ''[[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)|Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism]]''. (Oakland and Edinburgh: [[AK Press]], 2009), pp. 33–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Army''' was a collection of anarchist military units which fought in the [[Russian Civil War]],  sometimes on the side of the Bolshevik [[Red Army]], and sometimes for the opposing [[White Army]]. It was officially known as the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and it was under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]].

'''Fascism'''. The [[Blackshirts]] ({{lang-it|camicie nere, 'CCNN}}) were [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups in [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars|Italy]] during the period immediately following [[World War I]] and until the end of [[World War II]]. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the [[Arditi]], Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the military tool of his political movement.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915–1945'', Penguin Books, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with [[fasces]], an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his [[March on Rome]] with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." Hitler also wrote that "the new flag&amp;nbsp;... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The black [[swastika]] was meant to symbolize the [[Aryan]] race, which, according to the Nazis, "was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm |title=Nazi propaganda pamphlet "The Life of the Führer" |publisher=Calvin.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mein Kampf]], volume 2, chapter VII |last=Hitler |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Hitler |year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black became the color of the uniform of the [[SS]], the ''Schutzstaffel'' or "defense corps", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a [[black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the [[Nazi concentration camp badges]] on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to "their kind." Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the [[Romani people]], the habitually "work-shy," prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, "asocials", alcoholics and prostitutes]. Center for Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies. [[University of Minnesota]]. Retrieved September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in [[lesbian culture]] and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the [[British Union of Fascists]] before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriotic Resistance'''. The [[Lützow Free Corps]], composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing.  In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the [[German confederation]]. In 1866, [[Prussia]] unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000) ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamism'''. The [[Black Standard]] ({{lang|ar|راية السوداء |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-sawdā' }}, also known as {{lang|ar| راية العقاب |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-'uqāb}} "[[:wikt:راية|banner]] of the [[:wikt:عقاب#Arabic|eagle]]" or simply as {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:الراية|الراية]]|rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|al-rāya}} "the banner") is the historical flag flown by [[Muhammad]] in [[hadith|Islamic tradition]], an [[eschatology|eschatological]] symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]),&lt;ref name="cookshia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic|author=David Cook |year=2002|publisher=Darwin Press|page=197}} from Majlisi.&lt;/ref&gt; and a symbol used in [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].

Black has been a traditional color of cavalry and armoured or mechanized troops. German armoured troops ([[Panzerwaffe]]) traditionally wore black uniforms, and even in others, a [[black beret]] is common. In Finland, black is the symbolic color for both armoured troops and combat engineers, and military units of these specialities have black flags and unit insignia.

The [[black beret]] and the color black is also a symbol of special forces in many countries. Soviet and Russian [[OMON]] special police and [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Russian naval infantry]] wear a black beret. A black beret is also worn by military police in the Canadian, Czech, Croatian, Portuguese, Spanish and Serbian armies.

[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Holy Saturday.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church on Holy Saturday is adorned with black [[parament]]s, as black is the liturgical colour of [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] in the Lutheran Churches.]]
* In [[Christian]] theology, black was the color of the universe before [[God]] created light. In many religious cultures, from [[Mesoamerica]] to [[Oceania]] to [[India]] and [[Japan]], the world was created out of a primordial darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuppi, ''Color in Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;268–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bible]] the light of faith and Christianity is often contrasted with the darkness of ignorance and paganism.

In Christianity, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] is often called the "prince of darkness." The term was used in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', published in 1667, referring to [[Satan]], who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase ''princeps tenebrarum'', which occurs in the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century [[hymn]] ''Rhythmus de die mortis'' by [[Pietro Damiani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uan.it/alim/letteratura.nsf/(testiID)/9941C91390B5688BC125709F002D7C68!opendocument |title=Petrus Damiani: Opera poetica Pag 89 |publisher=Uan.it |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a sermon by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetti.ru/bernardus/86_1.shtml |title="Sermones in Cantica canticorum, I–XVII" – Bernardus Claraevallensis |publisher=Binetti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in ''[[King Lear]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (c. 1606), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
'The prince of darkness is a gentleman."

Priests and pastors of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches commonly wear black, as do [[monks]] of the [[Benedictine Order]], who consider it the color of humility and penitence.
* In [[Islam]], black, along with green, plays an important symbolic role. It is the color of the [[Black Standard]], the banner that is said to have been carried by the soldiers of [[Muhammad]]. It is also used as a symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]), and the flag of followers of [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].
* In [[Hinduism]], the goddess [[Kali]], goddess of time and change, is portrayed with black or dark blue skin. wearing a necklace adorned with severed heads and hands. Her name means "The black one". She destroys anger and passion according to Hindu mythology and her devotees are supposed to abstain from meat or intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddess Kali never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord Siva|url=http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Goddess_Kali_never_accepts_nonvegetarian_food_because_she_is_the_chaste_wife_of_Lord_Siva|publisher=Vani Quotes|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kali FAQ|url=http://www.shreemaa.org/questions-answers-goddess-kali/|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Kali does not eat meat, but it is the śāstra's injunction that those who are unable to give up meat-eating, they may sacrifice one goat, not cow, one small animal before the goddess Kali, on amāvāsya (new moon) day, night, not day, and they can eat it.

===Sports===
* The national [[rugby union]] team of New Zealand is called the ''[[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]'', in reference to their black outfits, and the color is also shared by other New Zealand national teams such as the [[Black Caps]] (cricket) and the [[Kiwis]] (rugby league).

===Idioms and expressions===
[[File:Hebridean ram.jpg|thumb|Namesake of the idiom "black sheep"]]
* In the United States, "[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]" (the day after [[Thanksgiving Day]], the fourth Thursday in November) is traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. Many Americans are on holiday because of Thanksgiving, and many retailers open earlier and close later than normal, and offer special prices. The day's name originated in [[Philadelphia]] sometime before 1961, and originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive downtown pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on that day.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;Ben Zimmer, [http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/3047/ The Origins of "Black Friday,"] ''Word Routes'' (November 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linguistlist239"&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R5955&amp;I=-3 Martin L.

==Associations and symbolism==

===Mourning===
In Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with [[mourning]] and bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 109. In the survey cited, 80 percent of respondents said black was the color of mourning.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.

In Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial [[mourning dress|dress code]]:  "non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded.  Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat.  Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "black day" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] marked ''[[fasti]]'' days with white stones and ''nefasti'' days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the [[Black September in Jordan]], when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and [[Black July]] in [[Sri Lanka]], the killing of members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population by the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] government.

In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which marked the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Darkness and evil===
In western popular culture, black has long been associated with [[evil]] and [[darkness]]. It is the traditional color of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgment]]. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.

The [[vampire]] of literature and films, such as [[Count Dracula]] of the [[Bram Stoker]] novel,  dressed in black, and could only move at night. The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' became the archetype of witches for generations of children.  Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.

===Power, authority, and solemnity===
Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]] (1285–1314), and in England from the time of [[Edward I]] (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently [[black and white (police vehicle)|Black and white]]. The [[riot control]] units of the [[Basque Autonomous Police]] in Spain are known as ''[[beltzak]]'' ("blacks") after their uniform.

Black today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.

Black evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls.  Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The [[mortarboard]] hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a [[biretta]] worn by Medieval professors and clerics

===Functionality===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The [[Ford Model T]], the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black house paint is becoming more popular with [[Sherwin-Williams]] reporting that the color, Tricorn Black, was the 6th most popular exterior house paint color in Canada and the 12th most popular paint in the United States in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Laura |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/1/17631794/modern-black-houses-exterior-colors |title=Black is the new black |work=[[Curbed]] |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnography===
{{further information|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom|Demographics of Canada|Demographics of Australia|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}
* The term "black" is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe [[African Americans]]. The terms for African Americans have changed over the years, as shown by the categories in the [[United States Census]], taken every ten years.
* In the first U.S. Census, taken in 1790, just four categories were used: Free White males, Free White females, other free persons, and slaves.
* In the 1820 census the new category "colored" was added.
* In the 1850 census, slaves were listed by owner, and a B indicated black, while an M indicated "[[mulatto]]."
* In the 1890 census, the categories for race were white, black, mulatto, [[quadroon]] (a person one-quarter black); [[octoroon]] (a person one-eighth black), Chinese, Japanese, or American Indian.
* In the 1930 census, anyone with any black blood was supposed to be listed as "[[Negro]]."
* In the 1970 census, the category "Negro or black" was used for the first time.
* In the 2000 and 2012 census, the category "Black or African-American" was used, defined as "a person having their origin in any of the racial groups in Africa." In the 2012 Census 12.1 percent of Americans identified themselves as Black or African-American.&lt;ref name=thru&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the [[United Kingdom]], since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census.  The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British.  Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.0 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, 0.8 percent as Black African, and 0.2 percent as Black (others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |title=The Classification of Ethnic Groups |publisher=National Statistics |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406195623/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In the 2006 census, 2.5 percent of the population identified themselves as black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/eth-eng.cfm] 2006 Canadian census, ethnicity&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the term black is not used in the census.  In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and/or [[Torres Strait]] Islanders.

In [[Brazil]], the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''preto'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 6.8 percent of the population identified themselves as "preto".&lt;ref&gt;IBGE. 2008 PNAD.

===Black and white===
* Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly light and darkness and good and evil. In [[Medieval literature]], the [[knight (stock character)|white knight]] usually represented virtue, the [[black knight]] something mysterious and sinister. In American [[westerns]], the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat.
* In the original game of [[chess]] invented in [[Persia]] or [[India]], the colors of the two sides were varied; a 12th-century Iranian chess set in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], has red and green pieces. But when the game was imported into Europe, the colors, corresponding to European culture, usually became black and white.
* Studies have shown that something printed in black letters on white has more authority with readers than any other color of printing.
* In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as [[black-and-white]], meaning that the issue at hand is [[dichotomy|dichotomized]] (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Black chambers and black ops===
Black is commonly associated with [[secrecy]].
* The [[Black Chamber]] was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen [[Elizabeth I]] had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a ''cabinet noir'' was established inside the French post office by [[Louis XIII]] to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the [[French Revolution]] but re-opened under [[Napoleon I]]. The [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Dutch Republic]] had similar black chambers.
* The United States created a secret peacetime [[Black Chamber]], called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the [[State Department]] and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes, including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, [[Henry Stimson]], stated that "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail." The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=NSAtimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-1952 Historical Timeline|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/pre_1952_timeline/index.shtml|work=National Security Agency|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''black project'' is a secret military project, such as [[Enigma machine|Enigma Decryption]] during World War II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police [[sting operation]].
* [[Black ops]] are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.
* A [[Black Budget]] is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.

===Elegance – black and fashion===
Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above.) In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 [[Edward VII]], then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short [[smoking jacket]].  The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a [[tuxedo]] in the U.S. The term "smoking" is still used today in Russia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;
Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;
The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the [[Duke of Windsor]] began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the [[little black dress|simple black dress]] by [[Coco Chanel]] in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]], explaining why black was so popular, said:  "Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer [[Christian Dior]] said, "elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and black exemplified elegance.

The expression  "X is the new black" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a [[cliché]].

Many performers of both popular and [[European classical music]], including French singers [[Edith Piaf]] and [[Juliette Greco]], and violinist [[Joshua Bell]] have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer [[Johnny Cash]] always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]" to explain why he dressed in that color: "We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black."

[[Image:Broad Ave Binghampton Memphis TN 1.jpg|thumb|Broad Avenue in 2010]]
'''Broad Avenue''' is a street and [[arts district]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], known for its transformation from a collection of vacant storefronts to a vibrant arts district in less than a decade.

==History==
Broad Avenue was originally the main street of [[Binghampton, Memphis|Binghampton]], a small [[railroad town]] chartered in 1895. In 1919, the city was [[annexed]] by [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and Broad Avenue gradually fell into disrepair. In the mid-2000s, various efforts were organized to bring the street back into use. From 2007 to 2012, the street became a vibrant arts district as local businesses began to occupy the then-vacant storefronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/23/editorial-broad-avenue-struts-its-stuff/ |title=Editorial: Broad Avenue struts its stuff|publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2010 a two-day "demonstration" was arranged in which the still vacant storefronts along Broad were temporarily filled with local vendors and stores in order to show what the street had the potential to become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13521178 |title=Taking Back Our Neighborhoods: A New Face for an Old Broad - Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee |publisher=Wmctv.com |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
In May 2011, French artist Guillaume Alby painted a large 1,800-square-foot geometrically styled mural on the 2500 block of Broad Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/may/07/wall-power/ |title=Muralist transforms warehouse wall along Broad Avenue |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of other art projects followed. These included another mural on a warehouse wall facing the street and the lighting-up of the iconic watertower which identifies Broad Avenue, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/mar/17/2-art-projects-will-brighten-broad-ave/ |title=2 art projects will brighten Broad Ave. |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also home to a bi-annual art walk, in which local artists display their wares along the street. The event is accompanied by free music and food from local restaurants and bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisconnect.com/2012/04/12/21335/ |title=Spring Art Walk on Broad Avenue Friday |publisher=MemphisConnect |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-10-06 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycling==
Broad Avenue is currently the home of the Memphis Greenline (cycling path) headquarters, and was used as an early demonstration of proposed bike lanes for the city of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |title=Broad Ambitions |publisher=Memphis Daily News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420160055/http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration, which proved to be a success (resulting in the permanent addition of bike lanes) was arranged by [[Livable Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |title=Bikeleague.org Blog » Blog Archive » A Better Block on Broad |publisher=Blog.bikeleague.org |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006044431/http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, it was proposed as a connector for cyclists between [[Overton Park]] and [[Shelby Farms Park]], two key locations in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson |first=Sara |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/jul/10/greenline-could-get-link-to-midtown |title=Shelby Farms Greenline could get link to Midtown Memphis |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Pacific International Exposition half dollar''', sometimes called the '''California Pacific half dollar''' or the '''San Diego half dollar''', is a [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1935 and 1936. [[Robert I. Aitken]] designed the coin. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts [[Minerva]] and other elements of the [[Seal of California]]; the reverse shows buildings from the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] (held 1935–1936), which the coin was issued to honor.

Legislation for the half dollar moved through Congress without opposition in early 1935, and Aitken was hired to design it. Once his creation was approved, the [[San Francisco Mint]] produced 250,000 coins, but expected sales did not materialize. Left with over 180,000 pieces they could not sell, the Exposition Commission went back to Congress for further legislation so it could return the unsold pieces and have new coins, dated 1936, hoping for greater sales in the second year of the fair's run. Although the Commission was successful in getting the legislation passed, it was less so in selling the coins, and 150,000 1936-dated pieces were returned to the Mint. The coins, of either date, sell in the low hundreds of dollars today.

== Background and authorization ==
The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] was a [[world's fair]] held in San Diego's [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] in 1935 and 1936. One of the largest expositions of its kind, it was held on {{convert|1400|acre}} of land, and cost $20 million. The fair attracted some 3.75 million visitors during its two-year run.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=38}}

At that time, [[commemorative coin]]s were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and sell them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3–5}} In the case of the California Pacific Exposition half dollar, it was the California Pacific International Exposition Co.{{sfn|Flynn|p=352}}
[[File:California Pacific 1935 U.S. stamp.1.jpg|thumb|left|Three-cent stamp issued by the [[United States Post Office Department]] for the Exposition, 1935]]
California's [[George Burnham]] introduced a bill for a California Pacific Exposition half dollar into the House of Representatives on February 19, 1935. It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures|Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|2259|date=February 19, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John J. Cochran]] of Missouri, acting chairman of that committee, reported back to the House on April 12 with the recommendation that it pass after small technical amendments were made. The bill called for the issuance of a maximum of 250,000 half dollars. Cochran noted that Congressman Burnham had appeared before the committee, representing that there would be no expense to the government, and sent a letter (reproduced in the report) stating the same. Burnham had also written that the Exposition had considerable participation by the federal government, and its officials expected 7 to 10 million people to attend.{{sfn|1935 House report|pp=1–2}} The following day, Cochran had the bill considered by the House, which passed the recommended amendment and then the bill itself without any debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5606–5607|date=April 13, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate received the bill on April 15, and referred to its [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Banking and Currency Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5624|date=April 15, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, the committee, through its chairman, [[Duncan U. Fletcher]] of Florida, recommended that the bill pass, with a report similar to that of the House.{{sfn|1935 Senate report|pp=1–2}} On April 26, the bill passed the Senate on Fletcher's motion without any discussion or dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|6444|date=April 26, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed it on May 3, 1935.{{sfn|Bowers|p=313}}

==Preparation and design==
California Senator [[William G. McAdoo]], former Secretary of the Treasury under [[Woodrow Wilson]], wrote to the incumbent Treasury Secretary, [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], proposing that the late president appear on the half dollar; Morgenthau wrote back calling the idea "interesting" and suggested it be directed to the Exposition Commission, which was responsible for securing designs.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=316, 322–323}} The January 1935 issue of ''[[The Numismatist]]'' (the journal of the [[American Numismatic Association]]), which went to press before the congressional actions, reported that there were plans for 50,000 silver dollar and 150,000 half dollar coins depicting President Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|title=Status of Commemorative Half Dollars of 1934|date=January 1935|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of California.svg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Seal of California, showing Minerva with a bear before her, a miner is busy to her left, and there is a busy river and mountains behind her|State [[Seal of California]]]]

Sculptor [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]], creator of other commemorative coins including the $50 [[Panama-Pacific commemorative coins|Panama-Pacific issue]], was hired to design the California Pacific half dollar. He submitted plaster models to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], charged by a 1921 executive order by President [[Warren G. Harding]] with making recommendations regarding public artworks, including coins. Commission sculptor-member [[Lee Lawrie]] took the lead in examining the models, and they were approved on July 5, 1935, though Lawrie questioned the legality of having coins omitting the mottoes {{small|LIBERTY}} and {{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}. Aitken subsequently added {{small|LIBERTY}} to the obverse.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=172–174}} After final approval, the models were shipped to the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York for reduction to coin-sized [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]], which were then sent to the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where the working dies were made. These dies were in turn were shipped to the [[San Francisco Mint]].{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=38}}

[[File:1915-S $50 Panama-Pacific 50 Dollar Octagonal.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Aitken's octagonal $50 piece, part of the 1915 [[Panama-Pacific commemorative coin issue]], also depicts Minerva.]]
Aitken's obverse shows elements of the [[California State Seal]] with a seated depiction of [[Minerva]]. She wears a helmet and holds a staff with her right hand, her left rests on a shield with {{small|EUREKA}} on it.{{sfn|Bowers|p=314}} On the shield is an [[aegis]], with the head of [[Medusa]] affixed; between goddess and shield is a [[cornucopia]] overflowing with produce, symbolic of California's vast resources. A [[grizzly bear]] is to the left of Minerva.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=37}} Behind them, in the distance, is a sailing ship and gold miner, with the hills of the [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre]] as background.{{sfn|Bowers|p=314}} The name of the issuing country and the denomination surround the central design, with {{small|LIBERTY}} under Minerva.{{sfn|Bowers|p=313}} The reverse shows two buildings constructed for the Exposition, and part of the California State Buildings at the fair, the California Tower and Chapel of St. Francis (today the [[San Diego Museum of Man]]). The outline which surrounds the buildings is said to suggest [[Spanish Mission architecture]] but Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their book on commemorative coins, identify it as a [[tressure]], found on a some medieval gold coins. The name of the exposition surrounds the design, with the date, {{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}} (under which the [[mint mark]] is found) and {{small|SAN DIEGO}} among the buildings.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=37}}

[[File:San Diego Museum of Man 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The California Tower and Chapel of St. Francis, [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], San Diego]]
Numismatic author [[Don Taxay]] called the half dollar "a very distinguished coin artistically,"{{sfn|Taxay|p=172}} and said of its reverse, "I cannot think of another architectural motif that has been treated so successfully on a United States coin."{{sfn|Taxay|p=174}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]] liked the California Pacific half dollar, deeming the Minerva "one of the most powerful uses of the facing figure in American numismatic art".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=190}} He deemed Aitken's design influenced by the pediments and other works he had sculpted during the 1920s and 1930s, including the pediment for the [[United States Supreme Court Building]]. He felt the depiction of the buildings on the reverse was "good enough for what it pretends to show," and  noted that the monogrammatic style of the artist's initials was imitated by [[Gilroy Roberts]] when signing his obverse of the [[Kennedy half dollar]] (1964).{{sfn|Vermeule|p=191}} Vermeule noted that the lettering "confirms the strength and balance of the total visual experience".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=191}}

==Production, distribution, and collecting==
250,132 coins were minted in San Francisco in August 1935. 132 were sent to Philadelphia and held for inspection and testing at the 1936 annual meeting of the [[Assay Commission]]. The 250,000 remaining coins were sent from San Francisco to the [[Bank of America]] branch in San Diego, which handled distribution, and placed on sale at the fair on August 12 at $1 each. Despite considerable publicity, only some 68,000 sold, 2,000 being held by the Exposition authorities.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=38}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=314}}

Although commemorative coin collecting (and investing) was becoming popular in 1935, the mintage of a quarter million coins, far in excess of some other issues of the era, meant that investors were indifferent to the California Pacific issue. With sales of the 1935–S{{efn|Dated 1935 with [[mint mark]] S for the San Francisco Mint, thus 1935-S.}} half dollar coming to a standstill, the Exposition Commission was well aware of this problem. Thus, they sought relief from Congress in the form of an act allowing them to return unsold half dollars for new ones, dated 1936. Coin collectors would view this as a new [[Glossary of numismatics#V|variety]] and possibly buy both, and melting the returned coins would decrease the supply and (hopefully) increase the attractiveness of the remaining 1935-S specimens.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=260–261}}{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=105}}

Accordingly, on January 6, 1936, Congressman Burnham introduced legislation to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|120|date=January 6, 1936}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, the committee reported back through New York's [[Andrew Somers]], noting that the bill provided that the exchange would take place without expense to the United States, and recommending that it pass.{{sfn|1936 House report|p=1}} When Burnham brought the matter to the House floor on March 16, Michigan's [[Jesse Wolcott]] asked how the exchange would be done without expense to the government, and Burnham affirmed that the Exposition Commission would meet all expenses. He explained that the coins had been received so late in the year there had not been time to sell many. There were no further questions, and the bill passed the House without objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|3799|date=March 16, 1936}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate committee reported on April 17, adding provisions requiring that the coins be dated 1936, regardless of when struck, and that they be produced at only one mint, chosen by the Director of the Mint, in line with other commemorative coin bills that committee had been reporting.{{sfn|1936 Senate report|p=1}} Early numismatic author David M. Bullowa noted these provisions, designed to prevent the creation of varieties, were thus inserted in a bill that itself created a new variety.{{sfn|Bullowa|pp=125–126}} The Senate considered the bill on April 24, and it was amended and passed without debate or opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6063|date=April 24, 1936}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the two versions passed were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where, on April 27, that body at Burnham's motion, without debate or opposition, agreed to the Senate amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6243|date=April 27, 1936}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt signed the bill on May 6.{{sfn|Flynn|p=354}}

[[G. Aubrey Davidson]], chairman of the Exposition Commission, wrote to Acting Director of the Mint [[Mary M. O'Reilly]] on May 16, 1936, asking that the coins (which were to be struck at the [[Denver Mint]] and bear its mint mark "D") be minted as quickly as possible, as heavy attendance was expected at the fair around [[Memorial Day]] at the end of May.{{sfn|Flynn|p=323}} The production at the Denver Mint made the California Pacific half dollar the first commemorative to be struck at San Francisco and at Denver, but not at Philadelphia. It is the only pre-1954 commemorative with that distinction.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=314}} A total of 180,092 of the 1936-D were produced, representing the number returned (the maximum allowed) plus 92 assay coins.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=261}} The new coins were placed on sale at $1.50 each.{{sfn|Bowers|p=314}}

There was a spike in prices for many commemorative coins in 1936,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=26–27}} but due to the relatively high mintages of both the 1935-S and 1936-D, the California Pacific coins sold badly, and when the Exposition closed in late 1936, fewer than 30,000 of the 1936-D had been sold.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=314–315}} On January 27, 1937, Davidson wrote to the Director of the Mint, [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], asking her to allow the return of some 150,000 coins for refund, the glut blamed on having a relatively short period to sell them. Once the Mint had granted permission, the Exposition Commission placed the 1935-S and 1936-D pieces it withheld from the melting pot on sale at $3 each.{{sfn|Flynn|p=324}} Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, stated that the price increase was "to create the appearance of demand and future rarity. This didn't work."{{sfn|Swiatek|p=261}}

In 1938, Emil Klicka, treasurer of the Exposition, offered the 1936-D for sale at $1 each, with a limit of ten.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=261}} The 1935-S coins were available at $2. Large hoards of both dates were held by insiders for decades, including one holding of 31,050 of the 1935-S, amounting to nearly half the extant mintage. These were gradually dispersed from the 1960s to the 1980s.{{sfn|Bowers|p=315}}  In 1962, the 1935-S was worth $9 in [[uncirculated coin|uncirculated]] condition, and the 1936-D was worth $11.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p= 104}} The edition of the ''Red Book'' (''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'') published in 2018 lists the 1935-S for between $100 and $160, depending on condition, with the 1936-D from between $100 and $225.{{sfn|Yeoman 2018|p=1080}} A near-pristine 1935-S sold at auction in 2014 for $4,994.{{sfn|Yeoman 2015|p=1148}}

{{Italic title}}
'''''Capital, Volume II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''''' is the second of three volumes of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. It was prepared by [[Friedrich Engels]] from notes left by [[Karl Marx]] and published in 1885.

==Contents==
Volume II is divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Vol2.|isbn=0-7178-0483-6|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers Co, Inc.|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits
# The Turnover of Capital
# The [[reproduction (economics)|Reproduction]] and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital

In this book, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae, not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or 'functioning capitalist.' Moreover, workers appear in Volume II, essentially as buyers of consumer goods and, therefore, as sellers of the commodity [[labour power]], rather than producers of value and [[surplus-value]] (although, this latter quality, established in Volume I, remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based).

Marx wrote in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: 'In Book 1. . . we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find ''already in existence in the market'' the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s).' This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] (Mandel, 1978, Intro to Vol. II of ''Capital'').

Part 3 is the point of departure for the topic of [[capital accumulation]], which was given its Marxist treatment later in detail by, among others, [[Rosa Luxemburg]].

Sets of '''ritual bronzes''' (in [[chinese language|chinese]]: '''中国青铜器''') are the most impressive surviving objects from the [[Chinese Bronze Age]]. During the [[Shang dynasty]], China became one of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and cast metal to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other household items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese lived by interpreting from lacquer paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=All About China: Stories, Songs, Crafts and More for Kids |last=Branscombe |first=Allison |date=November 21, 2014  |isbn=978-0804841214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being from around 1650 BCE, these elaborately decorated vessels were deposited as [[grave goods]] in the tombs of royalty and the nobility, and were evidently produced in very large numbers, with documented excavations finding over 200 pieces in a single royal tomb.  They were produced for an individual to use in ritual offerings of food and drink to his ancestors in family temples or ceremonial halls over tombs, or rather ritual banquets in which both living and dead members of a family participated; early literary records speak of these.  On the death of the owner they would be placed in his tomb, so that he could continue to pay his respects in the afterlife; other examples were cast specifically as grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 44-60&lt;/ref&gt; The zoomorphic motives are similar with the art of the [[karasuk culture]].

The ritual bronzes were probably not used for normal eating and drinking; they represent larger, more elaborate versions of the types of vessels used for this, and made in precious materials. Apart from table vessels, weapons and some other objects were made in special ritual forms. Another class of ritual objects are those, also including weapons, made in [[jade]], which was probably the most highly valued of all, and which had been long used for ritual tools and weapons, since about 4,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 44-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

At least initially, the production of bronze was probably controlled by the ruler, who gave unformed metal to his nobility as a sign of favour.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

They contain between 5% and 30% [[tin]] and between 2% and 3% [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lumea chineză (the first volume)| first1=Jaques|last1=Gernet|page=67 și 68|publisher=[[Editura meridiane]]|year=1987|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Bronzes ({{zh|s=青铜器 |t=青銅器 |p=qīng tóng qì |w=ch'ing t'ong ch'i}}) are some of the most important pieces of ancient [[Chinese art]], warranting an entire separate catalogue in the Imperial art collections.  The Chinese Bronze Age began in the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2070 – ca. 1600 BC), and bronze ritual containers form the bulk of collections of Chinese antiquities, reaching its zenith during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC) and the early part of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045–256 BC).

The majority of surviving Chinese ancient bronze artefacts are ritual forms rather than their equivalents made for practical use, either as tools or weapons.   Weapons like daggers and axes had a sacrificial meaning, symbolizing the heavenly power of the ruler. The strong religious associations of bronze objects brought up a great number of vessel types and shapes which became regarded as classic and totemic and were copied, often in other media such as [[Chinese porcelain]], throughout subsequent periods of [[Chinese art]].

The ritual books of old China minutely describe who was allowed to use what kinds of sacrificial vessels and how much. The king of Zhou used 9 [[Ding_(vessel)|ding]]s and 8 [[Gui_(vessel)|gui]] vessels, a duke was allowed to use 7 dings and 6 guis, a baron could use 5 dings and 3 guis, a nobleman was allowed to use 3 dings and 2 guis.  Turning to actual archaeological finds, the [[tomb of Fu Hao]], an unusually powerful Shang queen, contained her set of ritual vessels, numbering over two hundred, which are also far larger than the twenty-four vessels in the tomb of a contemporary nobleman.  Her higher status would have been clear not only to her contemporaries, but also, it was believed, to her ancestors and other spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the pieces were cast with inscriptions using the posthumous form of her name, indicating there were made especially for burial in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_fu.shtm "Excavations at the Tomb of Fu Hao"], accessed August 4, 2007,  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metallurgy and origin==
The origin of the ores or metals use for Shang and other early chinese bronze is a current (2018) topic of research. As with other early civilisations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus) the Shang period development was centered on river valleys, and driven in part by the introduction of intensive agriculture - in China such areas lacked ore deposits and required the import of metallurgical material. Typical Shang period bronzes contain over 2% lead, unlike contemporary coppers of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. Analysis of the ore/metals origins has been based on lead content and  trace isotope analysis.&lt;ref name="iso1"&gt;{{citation| doi= 10.1111/arcm.12352| title = DID CHINA IMPORT METALS FROM AFRICA IN THE BRONZE AGE?| first = S. |last=Liu| first2 = K.L.| last2= Chen| first3=Th.| last3=Rehren| first4= J.J. |last4 = Mei| first5 = J.L.| last5 = Chen| first6 = Y.|last6 = Liu| first7 = D.| last7= Killick| journal =  Archaeometry | year = 2018| volume=60|issue=1| pages = 105-117|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Shang period bronzes, various sites, from early to late Shang period, numerous samples of the bronze alloy are characterized by high [[radiogenic]] Lead isotope content (derived from both [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] decay), unlike most known native Chinese lead ores. Potential speculative sources of the ore include [[Qinling]], middle to lower [[Yangtze]] area, and south-west china; the possibility that ore or metal was imported from Africa in this period has been proposed, based on potential isotopic matches, but challenged and rejected by other researchers. Pre-Shang ([[Erlitou culture]]) bronzes do not contain the radiogenic lead isotopes.&lt;ref name="iso1"/&gt;

==Classification of pieces in the Imperial collection==
The appreciation, creation and collection of Chinese bronzes as pieces of art and not as ritual items began in the [[Song dynasty]] and reached its zenith in the [[Qing dynasty]] during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], whose massive collection is recorded in the catalogues known as the ''[[Xiqing gujian]]'' (西清古鑑) and the ''Xiqing jijian'' (西清繼鑑).  Within those two catalogues, the bronzeware is categorized according to use:
*Sacrificial vessels (祭器, jìqì),
*Wine vessels (酒器, jiǔqì),
*Food vessels (食器, shíqì),
*Water vessels (水器, shuǐqì),
*Musical instruments (樂器, yuèqì),
*Weapons (兵器, bīngqì),
*Measuring containers (量器, liángqì),
*Ancient money (錢幣, qiánbì), and
*Miscellaneous (雜器, záqì).

The most highly prized are generally the sacrificial and wine vessels, which form the majority of most collections. Often these vessels are elaborately decorated with ''[[taotie]]'' designs.

===Sacrificial vessels ===
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Houmuwu ding]] ({{zh|s=后母戊鼎|p=Hòumǔwù dǐng}}), the largest ancient bronze ever found]]
*''[[Ding (vessel)|Dǐng]]'' (鼎)  Sacrificial vessel (祭器), originally a cauldron for cooking and storing meat (食器). The Shang prototype has a round bowl, wider than it is tall, set on three legs (足); there are two short handles on each side (耳). Later examples became larger and larger and were considered a measure of power. It is considered the single most important class of Chinese bronzeware in terms of its cultural importance. There is a variation called a ''fāngdǐng'' (方鼎) which has a square bowl and four legs at each corner. There exist rare forms with lids. 西清古鑒 contains over two hundred examples, and this is the most highly regarded of all Chinese bronzes.
*''Dòu'' (豆): Sacrificial vessel (祭器) that was originally a food vessel. Flat, covered bowl on a long stem.
*''Fǔ'' (簠): Rectangular dish, triangular in vertical cross-section. Always with a lid shaped like the dish.
*[[Zun|''Zūn'']] (尊 or 樽 or 鐏): Wine vessel and sacrificial vessel (器為盛酒亦祭用也). Tall cylindrical wine cup, with no handles or legs. The mouth is usually slightly broader than the body. In the late ''Zhōu'' (周) dynasty, this type of vessel became exceedingly elaborate, often taking the shape of animals and abandoning the traditional shape. These later types are distinguished from gōng (觥) by retaining a small, roughly circular mouth. This type of vessel forms the second largest group of objects in the ''Xiqing gujian'', after the ''dǐng'' (鼎).
*''Zǔ'' (俎): Flat rectangular platform with square legs at each corner. Not represented in the ''Xiqing gujian''.
*''Yí'' (彝): Sacrificial vessel. Two forms: A. Large squat round pot with two handles; B. Tall box-like container, the base narrower than the mouth with a roof-like lid. Later became a generic name for all sacrificial vessels.

This type of vessel forms the second largest group of objects in the ''Xiqing gujian'', after the dǐng (鼎).

'''Cholamandal Artists' Village''', established in 1966, is the largest artists' commune in India. Its artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s–1980s), which brought [[modernism]] to art in [[South India]]. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=In India, Pioneers of Modernism Savor Their Success |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/arts/arts-abroad-in-india-pioneers-of-modernism-savor-their-success.html?pagewanted=all |date=29 January 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Stephen Kinzer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the village [[Injambakkam]], 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chennai]], [[India]], it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Cholamandal-Artists%27-Village-25859.htm Cholamandal Artists' Village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Celebrate the oeuvre|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/10/02/stories/100244m2.htm|date=2 October 2000|publisher=[[Business Line]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The community was founded by [[K. C. S. Paniker]], the principal of the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Arts]], along with his students and a few artists associated with the college. It used the `art-meets-craft' approach where artists made handicrafts for a living as they pursued their art. By the 1970s, the village became self-sufficient and grew into one of the most important meeting places for international artists in India. Today, it is one of the few artist-driven movements in India. Four decades on, it is one of the few artists' colonies in the world to survive successfully and its foundation remains one of the "10 biggest art moments" in India.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most of the original founding creative artists, painters and sculptors were students and artists associated with the [[Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai]] (Madras School of Arts), where [K.C.S. Paniker], noted metaphysical and abstract painter, was principal 1957 to 1967. These artists desired to form a congenial space for practising their art; 38 of them got together and formed the 'Artists Handicrafts Association' (AHA) in 1963 initially to sell the works of artists.

Gradually, the artists started working together, producing handicrafts in their spare time. They were among the first in the country to produce [[batik]] fabric; proceeds of their first batik exhibition went into buying the {{convert|8.5|acre|m2}} of land in 1966, which was to make up the village.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; By now K.C.S. Paniker had retired and founded the artists commune in April 1966.

It was named after the [[Chola dynasty]], which is known to have encouraged arts and ruled the region, 9-13th century AD — called ''Cholamandalam'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which literally translated as ''the realm of the [[Chola]]s''. Chola also lends its name to the [[Coromandel Coast]] of [[Bay of Bengal]], which is a short walk from the village.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;[http://www.cholamandalartistsvillage.org/aboutus.html About us]&lt;/ref&gt; Paniker was "worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tantric geometry: Velu Viswanadhan|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story_print.php?storyId=30155 |date=5 May 2007 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |page=|quote="“Panicker was worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions. 'Cholamandalam gave them the security,' says Viswanadhan."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year six artists moved into live and work on their own land. In the 60s, while they could hardly sell their paintings, avant garde wood and leather work, batik, ceramics and metal craft, they found a good market. This sustained them, while the local buyers were familiarized to modernism, which their art represented.

Electricity was provided in 1968 and till 1972 the mud road ended at [[Muttukadu boat house|Muttukadu]]. The village was on a lonely, bumpy road, now known as the [[East Coast Road]] highway to [[Mahabalipuram]], from [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)|Adyar]]. Chennai was further away, though today, it is right at its door steps, and the road is busy with traffic and shops and commercial establishments. Over the years, built their houses, studios, exhibition gallery, theatre, workshop and kitchen, which they jointly owned along with all the infrastructure of the village.

It nurtured artists such as [[J. Sultan Ali]], [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = K.M | first1 = Gopal | first2 = Selin | last2 = George

Nanda Gopal, S.G. Vasudev, K. Jayapala Panicker, Gopinath, Senathipathy, M.V. Devan and Richard Jesudas. Soon they formed a cooperative to look after the village and built a gallery, which displayed and sold their works; 20% of their sales went to the ‘Cholamandal Artists Handicrafts Association’, which used the funds for village upkeep. In time the cooperative became self-sufficient and held exhibitions of their work in major cities of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: Country Guides, Lonely Planet |last= Singh|first=Sarina|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location= |isbn=1-74104-308-5|page=1044 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&amp;pg=PA1044&amp;dq=%22Cholamandal+Artists+Village%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cholamandal%20Artists%20Village%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cholamandal collection  |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2009/02/27/stories/2009022750120400.htm |date=27 February 2009 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C.S. Paniker died in 1977. By this time the module had proven sustainable.&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; Over the years, work done by the artists at the village, initiated a period in south Indian art called the 'Madras Movement', which brought modernism to [[south India]]n art. The Progressive Painters’ Association (P.P.A.), one of the oldest art associations in India founded by Paniker in Chennai in 1944; it was inactive for many year after Paniker's death. The association was revived in 2006 and a new committee formed. It is now being carried forward by artists at the village&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=For art’s sake  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/02/12/stories/2009021251330400.htm |date= 12 February 2009|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brush with peace- Cholamandal: an Artists Village (OUP), edited by Josef James |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/07/18/stories/2004071800020100.htm |date=18 July 2004 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Progressive strokes  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/03/04/stories/2006030401800500.htm|date=4 March 2006 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annually elected general council of members administers Cholamandal.

==Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art==
During his last days Paniker had offered his oeuvre to the Madras government on the condition that a separate gallery be created for his work. When no response came from the government, the Trivandrum Art Gallery took up the offer and now houses an important collection of Paniker's work. The artists at the village wanted a place to display the work of the Madras Movement, thus idea of the art museum took place.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

The artists raised money from the private sector to fund a museum in the village, which would house a permanent collection of artworks representative of the Madras Movement.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{Cite web|title=Arts and ideas|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/12/04/stories/100444a3.htm|date=4 December 2000 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Master takes |url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=hub080809mastertakes.asp |date=8 August 2009 |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial design was made by a visiting Dutch couple, the design for the art centre was made by architects [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] of [[Shilpa Architects]] and M. V. Devan. As the project gathered momentum help came in from artists and corporates alike.

After three and half years of construction the building was finished — thus started a long search for works that exemplified the Madras Movement, which flourished between the early 50s and the 80s. Eventually about 60 per cent of the works were donated by senior artists and the rest were given on extended loan by art collectors around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Another first for Indian art |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/06/03/stories/2008060350110100.htm |date=3 June 2008 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art opened on 1 February 2009. It has a 'Museum of the Madras Movement', which display works of prominent artists of the movement (apart from that of Paniker) including J. Sultan Ali, [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]] M. Senathipathi, Late [[A.P. Santhanaraj]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090518010148/http://www.thenoblesage.com/page278.html P.S. Nandhan], [[S.G. Vasudev]], K.V. Haridasan, Thotta Tharani, Sculptor S. Nandagopal. The centre has two commercial galleries, 'Labernum' and 'Indigo', that can be rented free of commission charge, an art book store, and a craft shop. It is surrounded by tree-shaded sands which sport an international sculpture garden, displaying sculptures made by visiting artists from across India and the world through the decades.&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{Cite web|title= Eclectic mix of styles |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2003011300100200.htm&amp;date=2003/01/13/&amp;prd=mp&amp; |date= 13 January 2003|newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Today, the village houses art galleries, museums, and an open-air theatre for dance and theatre performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pippa de Bruyn |title=Frommer's India |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IzF1NZwot2cC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Cholamandalam+Artists+Village%22 |page=223 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2006 |isbn=0-7645-9899-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Artists Handicrafts Association is still in charge of the colony, and Paniker's son, sculptor S. Nandagopal, is the secretary of the village. Out of the original 40 artists, many are no more, and some have moved out, only 21 remain today. Cholamandal does not accept new members, though it has at least a dozen artists living or working there at any time, plus many artists-in-residence are at work.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

The village is open daily from 10am to 5pm. It is 10-minute walking distance from the Golden Beach. Local transport is easily available, and the Chennai International Airport is the nearest airport.

'''Cinéaste One''' is an arts and cultural organization based in [[Karachi]] formed for the purpose of establishing an infrastructure to encourage and promote short film making in [[Pakistan]]. It organizes workshops and seminars promoting film literacy and produces the [[Cinéaste One Student Film Festival]].

==History==
Cinéaste One film organization was formed in 2012 after [[Rumman Zia]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/796177/getting-to-know-karachi-in-five-films/ |title=Cinéaste One's Rumman Zia at Karachi Conference |publisher=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1152317/role-of-audience-in-creative-process-discussed |title=Rumman Zia discusses art at the Herald Forum |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Cinema 101’ workshops became a regular feature of [[Alliance Francaise]] de Karachi (AFK) cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danka.pk/?var_action=event_details&amp;event_id=17182 |title=Cinema 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zia and AFK agreed to publicly showcase the films coming out of the workshop. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival (COSFF) was produced; highlighting selected short films from workshop participants. The first time filmmaker’s efforts were lauded and the affair was deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article284&amp;decoupe_recherche=Cin%C3%A9aste%20One%20 |title=COSFF12 - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/#cineasteone/cineaste-one-radio-coverage |title=COSFF12 radio coverage |publisher=SoundCloud |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zia decided to capitalize on the event’s success. With an eye on cultivating the film scene, a bigger event was launched the following year. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival 2013 (COSFF13) assimilated Karachi’s major film schools:[http://www.saampt.org/ SAAMPT], [[SZABIST]], [[Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]], [[Iqra University]] and Cinema 101 workshops, on a single platform, supporting upcoming filmmakers and fashioning a film culture. A film-rating system was developed and an external jury composed of foreign and local artists and filmmakers were assembled.
An indie-rock band opened the event and COSFF13 marked a celebration rewarding the best coming out of Karachi’s film schools. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-169426-Cineaste-One-Student-Film-Festival-begins-tomorrow |title=COSFF13 press release |publisher=[[The News International]] |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/cineasteone/cosff-13-radio-coverage |title=COSFF13 radio coverage |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2013/04/08/kurrachee-wins-at-cineaste-one-student-film-festival/ |title=Kurrachee wins best film at COSFF13 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Cinéaste One Film Festival took place on Dec 20th 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article566 |title=COSFF14 - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magtheweekly.com/31jan%2D06feb2015/last_page4.asp |title=MAG interviews Cinéaste One's Rumman Zia |work=magtheweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmistan===
In 2015, Cinéaste One organized an art exposition titled Filmistan from April 18 - April 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article608 |title=Filmistan - Where did those days go ? - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1176764/journey-of-films-the-bygone-days |title=Journey of films: the bygone days |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fimistan featured a series of exhibitions showcasing Pakistani film posters, art and memorabilia from a bygone era.
Most of the memorabilia at the exhibition comes from the private collection of [[Guddu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1171575/guddu-the-last-of-lollywood-aficionados |title=Guddu: The last of lollywood aficionados |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clotho.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Druid Ridge Cemetery]] that represents the Greek fate Clotho]]
[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|''The Triumph of Death'', or ''The 3 Fates''. [[Flemish]] [[tapestry]] (probably Brussels, ca. 1510-1520). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]

'''Clotho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|θ|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Κλωθώ}}) is one of the Three Fates or [[Moirai]] who spin (Clotho), draw out ([[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]) and cut ([[Atropos]]) the thread of Life in ancient Greek mythology.  Her Roman equivalent is [[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life.  She also made major decisions, such as when a person was born, thus in effect controlling people's lives. This power enabled her not only to choose who was born, but also to decide when gods or mortals were to be saved or put to death. For example, Clotho brought Pelops back to life when his father boiled and killed him.

As one of the three fates her impact on Greek mythology was significant. Clotho, along with her sisters and [[Hermes]], was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people. Even though Clotho and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology. Thread represented human life and her decisions represented the fate of all people in society.

==Origin==
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Clotho and her sisters ([[Atropos]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]]. Clotho is also mentioned in the tenth book of the [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] of [[Plato]] as the daughter of Necessity. In Roman mythology it was believed that she was daughter of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

== The Ivory Shoulder ==
As one of the Three Fates, Clotho assisted Hermes in creating the alphabet, forced the goddess [[Aphrodite]] into making love with other gods, weakened the monster [[Typhon]] with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with a bolt of lightning, and aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Clotho also used her life-giving powers in the myth of [[Tantalus]], the man who had slain and prepared his son [[Pelops]] for a dinner party with the gods. When the gods had found out what Tantalus had done, they put the remaining pieces of Pelops in a cauldron.  Clotho brought him back to life, with the exception of his eaten shoulder, which was replaced by a chunk of ivory. Tantalus was then thrust into Hades for what he had done to his own kin. Clotho was worshiped in many places in Greece as one of the Three Fates and is sometimes associated with the Keres and Erinyes, which are other deity groups in Greek mythology. [[Ariadne]], the Greek goddess of fertility, is similar to Clotho in that she carries a ball of thread, much like Clotho's spindle.

== The Fooling of the Fates ==

Clotho, along with her sisters, was tricked into becoming intoxicated by [[Alcestis]]. Alcestis, who had two children with Admetus, became extremely saddened when Admetus became very sick and eventually died. Alcestis used Clotho's drunkenness to try to get her husband back. The Three Fates explained that if they were to find a replacement for Admetus then he could be released from the Underworld. A substitute was not found so Alcestis offered herself up to be the replacement in order to bring her husband back to life. As the agreement had been met, Alcestis quickly began to grow sick and sank into her grave as Admetus came back to life. At the last instant, [[Heracles]] arrived at the home of Admetus. When Death came to take Alcestis away, Heracles wrestled him and forced him to return Alcestis, allowing Admetus and Alcestis to be reunited.

== The Calydonian Boar Hunt ==

Although there does not seem to be an epic tale in Greek mythology in which the Fates are the main focus, they have played critical roles in the lives of gods and mortals. A tale in which the Fates played an integral part was that of [[Meleagros]] and the Brand, which [[W. H. D. Rouse]] describes in ''Gods, Heroes and Men of Ancient Greece''. Meleagros led a hunting party to slay the Calydonian Boar, which was set loose upon Calydon by Artemis.  She was displeased at the Calydonian king for neglecting to make a proper sacrifice to her. After slaying the boar, Meleagros presented the skin to a female member of the party, Atalanta, with whom he was smitten. His uncles were also part of the adventurous group, and they were upset by Meleagros' gift to Atalanta.  They believed a female should not have the skin of the boar. As a result of this disagreement, Meleagros slew his uncles, who were his mother's brothers. She was so enraged that she decided to take vengeance upon him.  She remembered a visit that the Fates had made a week after Meleagros was born. A Fate told Althaia that her son's life would expire when the burning log in the fireplace ceased to flame.  She promptly extinguished the flames, preserved it and hid it safely. In her rage over the loss of her brothers, she lit the log to punish Meleagros. As the log was consumed in flame, Meleagros burned to death.

'''Edge of Arabia''' is an independent arts initiative developing the appreciation of contemporary Arab art and culture with a particular focus on [[Saudi Arabia]]. As a social enterprise ''Edge of Arabia'' is committed to reaching new audiences and improving understanding through touring, non-commercial &amp; free exhibitions, through publications, and through education programs targeting schools &amp; universities.

==History==
The initiative was born from a chance encounter in 2003 between British artist, [[Stephen Stapleton]], and Saudi artists, [[Ahmed Mater]] and [[Abdulnasser Gharem]],&lt;ref&gt;Greenbox Museum of Contemporary Art from Saudi Arabia, [http://greenboxmuseum.com/sa-abdulnassergharem.html Abdulnasser Gharem]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Al Meftaha Arts Village in [[Abha]], Saudi Arabia. In January 2013 it opened a permanent space including a gallery and library in [[Battersea]], London, before moving to central London in 2016.

==World Tour==
''Edge of Arabia'' officially launched with a major exhibition showcasing 17 artists from Saudi Arabia at London's [[Brunei Gallery]] in October 2008. In just over two months the organizers saw more than 13,000 visitors, breaking the record for attendance at the [[University of London]]'s largest gallery.

In June 2009, ''Edge of Arabia'' travelled to the 53rd [[Venice Biennale]] to the Palazzo Contarini Polignac featuring the work of eight Saudi contemporary artists, and continued its world tour with an exhibition entitled ''Grey Borders/Grey Frontiers'' in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Tagesspiegel]], 29 June 2010, [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/soho-house-edge-of-arabia-zeigt-kunst-aus-saudi-arabien/1871386.html Edge of Arabia zeigt Kunst aus Saudi Arabien]&lt;/ref&gt; its ''TRANSiTION'' exhibition in [[Istanbul]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ikono.tv]], 19 October 2010, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJKZCHCW8s Edge of Arabia in Istanbul]&lt;/ref&gt; both in 2010, and ''TERMINAL'' coinciding with [[Art Dubai]] in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], 9 March 2011, [http://www.timeoutdubai.com/art/features/21699-edge-of-arabia Pioneering art scheme brings Saudi Arabia's contemporary art to the masses]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a collateral Venice Biennale event in 2011, the grassroots initiative further broadened its outreach to produce the first pan-Arab exhibition of contemporary art as part of the 54th [[Venice Biennale|Venice Art Biennale]]: ''The Future of A Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]], 3 June 2011, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2ed8469c-8d56-11e0-bf23-00144feab49a.html A spring in their step]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlin Art Link, 5 November 2011, [http://vimeo.com/31649658 "The Future of a Promise" at the 54th Venice Biennale]&lt;/ref&gt;

With its first public show inside the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[The Huffington Post]], 25 January 2012, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/saudi-artists-we-need-to-talk_n_1230477.html 'We Need To Talk': Saudi Arabia's First Public Contemporary Art Exhibit Tests Governmental Limits]&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2012 ''Edge of Arabia'' celebrated its home-coming in an unfinished shopping mall at the Al Furusia Marina with an exhibition entitled ''Edge of Arabia [[Jeddah]]: We Need To Talk''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], 18 January 2012, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/world/middleeast/contemporary-artists-rock-the-boat-gently-in-saudi-arabia.html?ref=middleeast Contemporary Artists Rock the Boat Gently in Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]], 23 January 2012, [http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/saudi-artists-find-a-voice-in-edge-of-arabias-jeddah-exhibition Saudi artists find a voice in Edge of Arabia's Jeddah exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; To continue engaging local school and university students in contemporary art from across the region, ''Edge of Arabia'''s accompanying art education programme included an art symposium, a dedicated education room with workshop, presentation and research facilities for visitors, guided tours of the exhibition, and practical workshops with participating artists.

On 6 October 2012, ''Edge of Arabia'' opened its most ambitious exhibition to date, showcasing large-scale, multi-media work by over 30 leading Arab and Islamic World artists in the heart of creative [[East London]] titled [http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/cometogether-london #COMETOGETHER]. During its three-week duration, the exhibition together with its side programme of educational events including workshops, talks and film screenings attracted over 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]], 19 October 2012, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e7318a5c-16ce-11e2-b1df-00144feabdc0.html An exhibition of the lesser known side of Middle East art comes to London’s East End]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gujarat Sahitya Akademi''' ({{lang-gu|ગુજરાત સાહિત્ય અકાદમી}}) or '''Gujarat Sahitya Academy''', established in 1981, is a government institution dedicated to the development of the languages spoken in [[Gujarat]], [[India]] and their literature. Gujarati, an official language of Gujarat, is one of them; the others are [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Urdu]]. {{as of|2017}}, [[Vishnu Pandya]] is the chairman of the Akademi.&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Vishnu Pandya replaces Bhagyesh Jha at Sahitya Akademi | website=The Times of India | date=2017-05-13 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/vishnu-pandya-replaces-jha-at-sahitya-akademi/articleshow/58651041.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wee2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel Wee|title=The Language of Organizational Styling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United kingdom|isbn=978-1-107-05480-6|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Gujarat Academy oversees five other academies; namely the Hindi Sahitya Academy for [[Hindi language|Hindi]], the Sanskrit Sahitya Academy for [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], the Kutchi Sahitya Academy for [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], the Sindhi Sahitya Academy for [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and the Urdu Sahitya Academy for [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. The registrar is the administrative head of all five academies. There are three standing committees, each of which has ten members, including five official members, for folk literature, Sanskrit language and literature, and other modern Indian languages.&lt;ref name="RahmanVerma2005"/&gt;

The chairman, the vice chairman and the registrar have day to day control of the Akademi. The Akademi's overall controlling authorities are the general body and the executive council.

== Controversy ==
The Akademi is an autonomous body empowered by its constitution to elect its chairman through a [[Electoral system|voting process]] by the 41 members of the general body.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bharat Mehta returns state Akademi award | website=The Indian Express | date=2015-11-04 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/bharat-mehta-returns-state-akademi-award/ | access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akademi did not have a chairman from 2003 to 2015 as the government did not held an election.&lt;ref name=AGSI/&gt; It was run by the registrar in-charge and the secretary of the sports, youth and cultural activities department; ex-offcio. In April 2015, the state government appointed Bhagyesh Jha, a Gujarati writer and retired [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]] officer, as the new chairman of the Akademi without any election.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes2017"/&gt; This resulted in the Autonomous Academy Agitation (''Swayatta Akademi Andolan'') led by [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]], the oldest literary institute in Gujarat and several Gujarati writers including Manishi Jani, [[Shirish Panchal]], [[Dhiru Parikh]], [[Chandrakant Topiwala]], Bharat Mehta, Paresh Naik and Raju Solanki.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writers demand autonomy for Sahitya Academy | website=The Indian Express | date=2011-06-06 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/writers-demand-autonomy-for-sahitya-academy/ | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parishad boycotted the activities of the Akademi in protest. In March 2016, the Gujarati poet [[Harsh Brahmbhatt]] declined the award which had been conferred to him by the Akademi for his book.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writer declines award from ‘non-autonomous’ Academy | website=The Indian Express | date=2016-03-29 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/writer-declines-award-from-non-autonomous-academy/ | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Bhagyesh Jha and two other writers [[Chinu Modi]] and [[Vinod Bhatt]], said to be the supporter of Jha, used the word ''[[Taliban]]'' for the writers like [[Dhiru Parikh]] and [[Niranjan Bhagat]], who had supported the agitation. [[Pravin Pandya]] returned the award he had received in 2004 in protest.&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writer returns award to Gujarat Sahitya Parishad | website=The Times of India | date=2016-01-15 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Writer-returns-award-to-Gujarat-Sahitya-Parishad/articleshow/49613917.cms | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Gujarati writer and literary critic, Bharat Mehta, returned the award which he had received in 2008.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"/&gt; Dhiru Parikh, along with other writers, submitted a [[public interest litigation]] to the [[Gujarat High Court]].&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes2017"/&gt;

If you're thinking of blanking this page: don't. It's been done. Nobody will laugh. We probably won't even be motivated enough to block you from editing, it will be treated as vandalism, but don't count on that. On the other hand, to see literal renderings of this article, please visit http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Blank_Page and http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nihilism

--&gt;
An '''intentionally blank page''' or '''vacat page''' (from Latin: ''vacare'' for "being empty") is a [[page (paper)|page]] that is devoid of content and may be unexpected. Such pages may serve purposes ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as "'''This page''' [is] '''intentionally left blank.'''" Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals, and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a [[printing]] error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.

==Uses for intentionally blank pages==
[[File:AEC blank page.png|250px|left|thumb|An intentionally blank page on a PDF document from the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]. The document has 80 printable pages, and content ends on page 77.]]

Intentionally blank pages are usually the result of printing conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page ([[Recto and verso|recto page]]); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet in such a way that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an [[even working]], and the group of pages is called a section or '''signature'''. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.

For example, if a book with 318 pages of content is printed using 32-page signatures, it will require 10 signatures, 320 pages in total.  At the very end of the book — that is, at the end of the last signature — there will be 2 unused (blank) pages.

If a printer's document processor has been designed to skip completely blank pages, notices may also be required on intentionally blank pages to prevent incorrect [[page numbering]].

Intentionally blank pages are ubiquitous in technical and instructional manuals, directories, and other large, mass-produced volumes of text. The contents of manuals produced by a given product's vendor are often compiled from generic instructions suitable for a variety of products, with additional instructions or chapters included for the specific product or model in question. This automation of manual generation leads to intentionally blank pages to fit the requirements for mass printing.

In digital documents, pages are intentionally left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start on the backs of pages. Intentionally blank pages have also been used in documents distributed in [[ring binder]]s. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.

===Standardized tests===
[[File:No test material on this page.svg|thumb|right|250px|Intentionally blank page in the style used in [[standardized test]]s]]
Intentionally blank pages can be useful in [[standardized test]]s such as the [[GCSE]], [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], [[SAT]], [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], [[MCAT]], and [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing intentionally blank pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as "this page has been intentionally left blank", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor. These pages may also be useful as [[scratch paper]].

===Sheet music===
In books of [[sheet music]], relatively short pieces of music that span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span the left and right pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.

===Classified documents===
In the United States armed forces, classified{{how?|date=July 2017}} documents require page checks whenever custody is transferred or an inventory is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney |first=Scott |title=NAVEDTRA 14127: Intelligence Specialist 3 &amp; 2, Volume 1 |work=Non-Resident Course |publisher=Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center ([[United States Navy]]) |url=http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20&amp;%202,%20Volume%201.pdf |date=November 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714094003/http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20%26%202%2C%20Volume%201.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blank pages are all marked "This page intentionally left blank", so page checks are unambiguous, and every page of the document is accounted for.

==Variations==
Intentionally blank pages placed at the end of books are often used to balance the [[Bookbinding|folio]]s that make up the book (see [[bookbinding]]). Often these pages are completely blank with no such statement or are used as "Notes" pages, serving a practical purpose. In the case of [[telephone directory|telephone-number directories]], these pages are often used to list important numbers and addresses.  These pages may list other books available from the same publisher.

Book publishers have also used stylized designs ([[dingbat]]s) underneath the last paragraph of a chapter to indicate that no other content is to be expected until the next chapter, allowing for the possibility of blank pages without misunderstandings by the readers.

There are also published books that, as a novelty, [[empty book|contain nothing but blank pages]].

==Examples==
*[[Andy Griffiths (author)|Andy Griffiths]]' book ''[[Just Stupid!]]'' begins with a cartoon snail saying to the reader, "This page would be blank if I were not here telling you that this page would be blank if I were not here telling you that..." on an endless loop.
*Humorist [[Don Novello]]'s 1977 book ''The Lazlo Letters'' ends with several otherwise-blank pages marked "FREE PAPER!".{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}
*Comedian [[Demetri Martin]]'s book ''This Is A Book'' contains an otherwise blank page which says, "This page unintentionally left blank."
*[[List of Iranian writers|Iranian novelist]] [[Reza Amirkhani]]'s book ''Man-e-oo'' (His Ego) has one whole chapter of blank pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ermia.ir/contents.aspx?id=762 |title= آن چه در وب راجع به من او نوشته‌اند (۱۵)  (What has been written about ''Man-e-oo'' on the web (15)|last1= Amirkhani|first1= Reza |date= 18 February 2012 |website= Reza Amirkhani's Official Website |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The phrase was a recurring joke in [[Infocom]] text adventure games. In their first title, ''[[Zork 1]]'', inspecting an engraved wooden door resulted in the text: "The engravings translate to 'This space intentionally left blank'."
*[[Idries Shah]]'s book ''[[The Book of the Book]]'' contains 10 pages describing why the following pages are important, and then a big amount of blank pages. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the theory that you shouldn't judge the content by its container.&lt;ref name="The book at google books."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Idries|title=The book of the book.|date=1969|publisher=Octagon Pr.|location=London|isbn=9780900860126|edition=4. impr.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WviNfB2q_oEC&amp;pg=PP3&amp;dq=shah+The+Book+of+the+Book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI95nJ-LeIxgIV727bCh3AvQCO#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Congress of Orientalists''', initiated in Paris in 1873, was an international [[meeting|conference]] of [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] (initially mostly scholars from Europe and the USA). The first thirteen meetings were held in Europe; the fourteenth congress was held in Algiers in 1905. Papers were primarily about philology and archaeology. The Proceedings of the Congresses were published. The work of the International Congress of Orientalists is carried on by the International Congress of Asian and North African Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalists, International Congress Of, in Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, 2004. https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/orientalists-international-congress - accessed 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International VELUX Award''' challenges students of architecture to explore the theme of sunlight and daylight. The award is biennial and was first presented in 2004.

The award celebrates excellence in completed works on any scale from a small scale component to large urban contexts or abstract concepts and experimentation. The award is presented by [[VELUX]] in close cooperation with the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA) and the European Association for Architectural Education (EAAE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php European Association for Architectural Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417013813/http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php |date=2008-04-17 }} Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
“Light of Tomorrow” is the theme of the International VELUX Award. The award wants to challenge the future of daylight in the built environment. The award contains no specific categories and is in no way restricted to the use of VELUX products. The jury of the International VELUX Award comprises internationally recognized architects and other building professionals. Any registered student of architecture – individual or team – from all over the world may participate in the award. The award wants to acknowledge not only the students but their teachers as well. Therefore, all students must be backed and granted submission by a teacher from a school of architecture.

== History ==
The first International VELUX Award took place in 2004. 760 students from 194 schools in 34 countries in Europe registered, and 258 students from 106 schools in 27 countries submitted their projects. The international jury led by [[Glenn Murcutt]] selected three winners and eight honourable mentions, who were announced at the Award event held in Paris.

== 2004 winners ==
In 2004 the first prize went to Norwegian student Claes Heske Ekornås for his project “Light as matter”. In 2004, ten winners were announced at the Award event in Paris.

== 2006 winners ==
In 2006, the award went global – inviting students from all over the world to participate. The number of submissions more than doubled reaching 557 projects from 225 schools in 53 countries. The international jury led by Per Olaf Fjeld decided to award three winners and 17 honourable mentions, and they were all celebrated at the Award event at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in Bilbao, Spain.

Louise Groenlund of Denmark won the International VELUX Award for her project ”A museum of photography”. Twenty winners and honourable mentions were announced at the Award event at the Guggenheim Bilbao in November 2006.

== 2008 winners ==
In 2008, the award received 686 projects, representing 244 schools of architecture in 46 countries. The international jury led by jury chairman Hani Rashid of [[Asymptote Architecture]] decided to award three winners and eight honourable mentions, who were celebrated at the Pisani Palace in Venice in November 2008.

The jury appointed three prize winners and eight honourable mentions. Reilly O’Neil Hogan from [[Cornell University]], USA, won first prize for his project “Embodied Ephemerality”. Ruan Hau and Xiong Xing from [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing won second prize for their project ”Interface repairing – Light Festival”. Dean Carlo MacGregor from [[Lusíada University]] in Lisbon, Portugal, won third prize for his project “Light has a body”.

== 2010 winners ==
In 2010, the award represented more countries than ever before. There were 673 entries from 280 schools in 55 countries. The international jury led by jury chairman Magda Mostafa decided to award three winners and eight honourable mentions. They were celebrated at the award event on 6 October 2010 in [[La Rochelle]], France.

The jury appointed three prize winners and eight honourable mentions. Young-Gook Park, Kim Dea Hyun, Choi Jin Kyu and Kim Won Ill from Hanyang University, South Korea, won the first prize for their project Constellation of Light Field. Ma Xin, Wang Rui and Yang Meng from the Architecture School of Tianjin University, China, won the second prize for their project Condensation of Variational Sunlight Influences. Joe Wu from Delft University of Technology, TU Delft, the Netherlands, also won the second prize for his project Lightscape between gaps.

'''Karl Sovanka''' ('''Karol Šovánka''') (7 March 1893 in [[Uhrovec]], near [[Trenčín]], [[Slovakia]] – 1961 in [[Östringen]], Germany) was a painter and sculptor. He is world-known for his paintings of animals and hunting motifs.

He was a famous painter and sculptor from the town of [[Kezmarok|Kežmarok]]. He studied in [[Budapest]] (prof. Ľudovít Mátray), in [[Brussel]] (prof. van der Stappen), and in Paris. He was a member of the Slovak painters club in [[Bratislava]].

Sovanka was painting countrysides, animals and hunting motifs in nature, and he also made some sculptures and glasses. At an exhibition in [[Prague]] in 1931, he was exhibited with the oil paintings "Fox in the winter", "Dogs with boar", and others. Besides Slovakia and Prague, he also held exhibitions in [[Brno]] and Budapest.

Other famous paintings: [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]]s countryside.

[[File:Loewenmensch2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Löwenmensch'', a lion-headed figurine found in Germany, dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] of about 35,000 to 40,000 years ago]]
The '''Löwenmensch figurine''' or '''Lion-man of the Hohlenstein-Stadel''' is a prehistoric ivory [[sculpture]] that was discovered in the [[Hohlenstein-Stadel]], a German cave in 1939. The German name, '''Löwenmensch''' meaning "lion-human", is used most frequently because it was discovered and is exhibited in Germany.

The lion-headed figurine is the oldest-known [[zoomorphic]] (animal-shaped) sculpture in the world, and the oldest-known uncontested example of [[figurative art]]. It has been determined by [[carbon dating]] of the layer in which it was found to be between 35,000 and 40,000 years old, and therefore is associated with the archaeological [[Aurignacian]] culture of the Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/figur_3.html 14C dating - The age of the lion man] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; It was carved out of [[mammoth ivory]] using a [[flint]] stone knife. Seven parallel, transverse, carved gouges are on the left arm.

After several reconstructions that have incorporated newly found fragments, the figurine stands {{convert|31.1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|5.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|5.9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. It currently is displayed in the [[Ulm]] Museum, Germany.

Systematic excavations at [[Hohlenstein-Stadel]] cave began in 1937 under the direction of prehistoric historian [[:de:Robert Wetzel (Anatom)|Robert Wetzel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1939.html Discovery: 1939] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a fragmented [[mammoth]]-[[ivory]] figurine was made on 25 August 1939 by geologist [[:de:Otto Völzing|Otto Völzing]].&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; The start of World War II just one week later, meant that the [[fieldwork]] was left incomplete and analysis of the finds was not undertaken.  The excavation trenches were backfilled with the same soil in which the ivory had been found.&lt;ref name=lobell/&gt; 

For approximately thirty years, the fragments lay forgotten at the nearby [[:de:Ulmer Museum|Museum of Ulm]]. It was not until archaeologist [[Joachim Hahn]] started an inventory and assembly of more than 200 fragments that a figurine with animal and human features began to emerge.&lt;ref name=lobell&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Life for the Lion Man|author=Jarrett A. Lobell|date= March 2012|volume= 65|issue= 2|journal=Archaeology|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1203/features/stadelhole_hohlenstein_paleolithic_lowenmensch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetzel continued to spend summers digging at the site until 1961,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1956.html Discovery: 1956] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and further finds of ivory were made on the cave floor in the 1970s. In 1982, paleontologist [[Elisabeth Schmid]] combined the new fragments with Hahn's reconstruction, correcting some errors and adding pieces of the nose and mouth that emphasized the figurine's feline characteristics.&lt;ref name=lobell/&gt;{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images29/lionmenschhhh.jpg These images] of a preliminary reconstruction from 1980 shows how much has been achieved after years of painstaking reconstruction. (Adam, K., Kurz, R., 1980 ''Eiszeitkunst im süddeutschen Raum'')}}

In 1987, a comprehensive restoration began in the workshops of the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg]] by Ute Wolf in cooperation with Schmid. During the work, which took more than six months, it was realized that the figurine was only about two-thirds complete. The back is severely damaged and the legs are missing some ivory [[Lamella (materials)|lamellae]]. The ears, eye-holes, two-thirds of the mouth and nose, and the back of the head are preserved. To fill gaps in the head and body a reversible substance consisting of a mixture of beeswax, artificial wax, and chalk was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1987.html Discovery: 1987] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, further excavations were carried out in the cave. All layers were sifted systematically, which led to many minute fragments being discovered. The first new adjustments were simulated virtually so that fragments could be added without having to disassemble the original recreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_2011.html Discovery: 2011] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images24/lionladyreconst.jpg X-ray computed tomographs of "Löwenmenschen"] After restoration 1987/88 with new fragments from the 2010 excavation (red) and free fragments from the stock of the museum (green)}}

In 2012, a second restoration was begun in the workshops of the State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments in Esslingen under the leadership of [[Nicole Ebinger-Rist]]. The figurine was disassembled into its individual parts and newly discovered fragments were added along with the old ones, allowing further completion of areas of the head, back, and right side of the body, and artificial additions used during the first restoration were discarded.&lt;ref name=ulmer2013/&gt; The Löwenmensch figurine grew in height from 296 to 311 millimetres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/ulm_neu_ulm/loewenmensch-ist-gewachsen-11005726.html|author=Henning Petershagen|date=2 November 2013|title=Löwenmensch ist gewachsen|work=Südwest Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was completed in late 2013.&lt;ref name=ulmer2013&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_2013.html Discovery: 2011] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Loewenmensch1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Löwenmensch figurine after restoration in 2013]]
Assignment of gender became an objective of certain researchers. Initially, the figurine was classified as male by Hahn who suggested a plate on the abdomen could be a flaccid penis. Schmid later classified this feature as a pubic triangle,&lt;ref name=spieg&gt;{{cite news|title=Puzzle im Schutt|work=Der Spiegel|author=Matthias Schulz|date=5 December 2011|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-82612721.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, and from examination of new parts of the sculpture, determined that the figurine was that of a woman with the head of a "''{{lang|de|Höhlenlöwin}}''" (female [[Panthera leo spelaea|European cave lion]]).&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Jochen |last=Duckeck |date=2008-12-10 |title=Arch&amp;auml;ologie: Der Löwenmensch |url=http://www.showcaves.com/german/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |language=German |quote=Joachim Hahn hatte die Figur als männlich betrachtet. Elisabeth Schmid kam zu dem Schluß, dass es sich um die Figur einer Frau mit dem Kopf einer Höhlenlöwin handele. |accessdate=2009-05-17 |postscript=. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521210909/http://www.showcaves.com/german/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |archive-date=2009-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }} and {{Cite web |first=Jochen |last=Duckeck |date=2008-12-10 |title=Archaeology: Lionheaded Figurine |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male European cave lions often lacked distinctive manes, so the absence of a mane could not determine categorically that the figurine was that of a lioness, and a debate about its gender ensued among some involved in the research and the popular press. Kurt Wehrberger of the Ulm Museum stated that the statue had become an "icon of the feminist movement".&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; 

After the 2012–13 restoration it was realized that the triangular platelet in the genital area was processed all around separating it from the figurine. A fracture point suggests that originally it may have been square in shape. Although an objective determination of the gender of the Löwenmensch figurine is impossible, debate continues, with the most common interpretation of the fragment being a stylized male sex organ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung4.html Importance: Sex?] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Löwenmensch figurine lay in a chamber almost 30 metres from the entrance of the Stadel cave and was accompanied by many other remarkable objects. Bone tools and worked antlers were found, along with jewellery consisting of pendants, beads, and perforated animal teeth. The chamber was probably a special place, possibly used as a storehouse or hiding-place, or maybe as an area for cultic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung2.html Importance: Depot - hiding place - cult place?] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar but smaller lion-headed human sculpture was found along with other animal figurines and several flutes in the nearby [[Vogelherd Cave]]. This leads to the possibility that the Löwenmensch figurines were important in the [[mythology]] of humans of the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Archaeologist [[Nicholas Conard]] has suggested that the second lion-figurine "lends support to the hypothesis that Aurignacian people may have practised [[shamanism]] ... and that it should be considered strong evidence for fully symbolic communication and cultural modernity".&lt;ref name="CoolidgeWynn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick L. Coolidge|author2=Thomas Wynn|title=The Rise of Homo sapiens: The Evolution of Modern Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZHtlD7Ife8C&amp;pg=PT174|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5653-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurine shares certain similarities with later French cave paintings, which also show hybrid creatures with human-like lower bodies and animal heads such as the "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|Sorcerer]]" from the [[Trois Frères]] in the Pyrennes or the "[[Bison-man (cave art)|Bison-man]]" from the [[Grotte de Gabillou]] in the Dordogne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung3.html Importance: Animal and human being] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
The carving of the figurine from hard mammoth tusk would have been a complex and time-consuming task.{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images29/lioncarvinginsitu.jpg This image] shows the positioning of the figurine within the tusk. Schmid found that the groin area coincided with the apex of the tusk's [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]]. "The long axis of the figure follows the nerve canal with the head at the narrowing end. This expert positioning suggests that the make deliberately selected a portion of the tusk suitable for a preconceived work." (Cook, 2013)}}  A similarly-sized tusk found in the same cave has marks that "indicate that the skin and thin bone around the tooth cavity of the upper jaw were cut through to the surface of the tooth, which was then exposed for detachment with a hammer. The tip was harder and had to be removed by wedging and splitting."&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

Wulf Hein and Kurt Wehrberger conducted an [[Experimental archaeology|experimental]] replication with the kinds of stone tool available at the time. Removing the base of the tusk took ten hours. The body was carved with a steep-fronted scraper; the [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s requiring regular resharpening. Several different tools were needed to separate the torso from the insides of the arms while shaping the head and shoulders, which involved difficult cutting across the grain of the ivory, often required two hands on the tool. The basic shaping took around 200 hours, and in total the recreation took more than 370 hours.{{efn|The Ulm Museum site says 360 hours, Cook (2013) says 320, whereas the video made by the team says 370+}} Jill Cook, Curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, suggests that "unless the sculpture was created slowly at odd moments over several months, someone as skilled as an artist may have been excused from other subsistence tasks to work specially on this piece."&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite book|author= Cook, J.|title= Ice Age art: arrival of the modern mind|publisher= The British Museum|date= 18 February 2013|isbn=978-0714123332}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his October 2017 [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Living with the Gods]]'', [[Neil MacGregor]] asked Cook "[…] so why would a community living on the edge of subsistence, whose primary concerns were finding food, keeping that fire going, protecting children from predators, allow someone to spend so much time away from those tasks?", to which she replied that it was about "[…] a relationship to things unseen, to the vital forces of nature, that you need to perhaps propitiate, perhaps connect to, in order to ensure your successful life".&lt;ref name="BBC Living With The Gods"&gt;{{cite episode| title= The Beginnings of Belief| episodelink= | series= Living With The Gods | serieslink= | credits= Presenter: [[Neil MacGregor]]; Producer: Paul Kobrak| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b099xhmj| minutes= 06:08| airdate= 23 October 2017| accessdate= 23 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were '''146 medalists''' in [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|the art competitions]] that were part of the [[Olympic Games]] from [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] until [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]]. These art competitions were considered an integral part of the movement by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and necessary to recapture the complete essence of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Their absence before the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], according to journalism professor Richard Stanton, stems from Coubertin "not wanting to fragment the focus of his new and fragile movement".&lt;ref name="Stanton3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Stanton|first = Richard|title = The Forgotten Olympic Art Competitions|publisher = [[Trafford Publishing]]|edition = 1st|date = 2000|location = [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]|page = 3|isbn = 1552126064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art competitions were originally planned for inclusion in the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] but were delayed after that edition's change in venue from Rome to London following the 1906 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref name="Stanton18"&gt;Stanton, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] they had grown to be considered internationally relevant and potentially "a milestone in advancing public awareness of art as a whole".&lt;ref name="Stanton69"&gt;Stanton, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their first three appearances, the art competitions were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] split these into subcategories in the hopes of increasing participation.&lt;ref name="Stanton95"&gt;Stanton, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was a successful strategy, the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories.&lt;ref name="Stanton146"&gt;Stanton, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.&lt;ref name="Stanton158"&gt;Stanton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a final appearance at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], art competitions were removed from the Olympic program. Planners of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee.&lt;ref name="Stanton210"&gt;Stanton, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments,&lt;ref name="Stanton211"&gt;Stanton, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions during the course of the Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer [[Olympic games|Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Stanton213"&gt;Stanton, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC does not track medalists in Olympic art competitions in its database and thus the prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges were not required to distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as [[Alex Diggelmann]] of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition.&lt;ref name="1948 Report"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948|page = 536|publisher = The Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad|location = [[London]]|date = 1951|url = http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948part2.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's [[Josef Petersen]], who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's [[Jean Jacoby]] is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author [[Aale Tynni]] was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals,&lt;ref name="SRArt"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|author2 = Jeroen Heijmans|author3 = Bill Mallon|author4 = Hilary Evans|title = Art Competitions|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|accessdate = 2012-03-07|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66VSjSXMP?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|archivedate = 2012-03-28|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman.

'''Computer and video game collector and limited editions''' (commonly referred to as CE and LE's) are [[video games]] packaged with [[Special edition|bonus materials and enhancements]] not available in the standard release.  Such bonuses can range from special packaging to printed artwork to extra discs containing additional content.  These versions are typically of a predetermined limited release and act as promotional tools for the publisher, and items of value for collectors.&lt;ref&gt;"For the Fans: ''GI'' Looks into Limited Editions," ''Game Informer'' 179 (March 2008): 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--'''Before making additions please note the following paragraph'''--&gt;Not all titles released as a "Special/Collector's/Etc. Edition" are necessarily in any substantial way superior to the standard edition. True Collector's and Limited Editions are those released with extra materials or content, that were limited in every case.  &lt;!--It also only refers to titles released for the North American market, to help control the size of the list. The Japanese market, for example, has many dozens of titles receive an LE release every year. (Source?)--&gt; For example, most [[Game of the Year]], Gold, or Platinum editions are [[Reissue|re-releases]] and rarely contain anything of extra value nor are of particular limited release, and thus are not generally considered Collector's or Limited Editions. &lt;!--Feel free to use the discussion page if you are unsure about a potential addition.--&gt;

| ''' ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' Limited Edition
| DC
| The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was a pre-release version of the game distributed to stores and rental locations, it did not include any bonus content. The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was originally distributed to approximately 400 Funcoland locations as a disc-only release to be used in Dreamcast kiosks promoting the upcoming release of the console. These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy.

Later, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it's official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state “Limited Edition” and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to its exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a “Hollywood Video” security sticker.

'''''The Merry Trio''''' is an oil painting by [[Judith Leyster]] in the Collection Noortman.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter&gt;Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age, by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #9&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a work by [[Frans Hals]] until 1903.

==Provenance==
The painting was together with Leyster's ''[[The Last Drop by Leyster|The Last Drop]]'' in the collection of the British dealer/auction house Sir George Donaldson (1845-1925) where it was documented in 1903.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; The two may be pendants, as they were then reported to have the same measurements.

According to Hofrichter, the scene shows the popular ''Merry company'' theme common in 17th-century ''commedia dell'arte'' plays.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; This daylight scene serves as a contrast to its candlelit pendant which warns of the dangers of drinking and smoking. Clearly, Leyster preferred the sober yet festive daytime scene, because she selected the musician on the right to illustrate her [[Self-portrait by Judith Leyster|self-portrait]].

[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.64|''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'']]

'''''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau''''' ({{lang-fr|Napoléon sur le champ de bataille d'Eylau}}) is an [[oil painting]] of 1808 by French [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painter [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]. Completed during the winter of 1807–1808, the work has become an icon of the emerging style of [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|French Romanticism]]. It depicts a moment from the aftermath of the bloody [[Battle of Eylau]] (7–8 February 1807) in which [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] surveys the battlefield where his ''[[Grande Armée]]'' secured a costly victory against the Russians. Although ''Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' retains elements of [[history painting]], it is by far Gros's most realistic work depicting Napoleon and breaks from the subtlety of [[Neoclassicism]]. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of artists like [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]].

== Background ==
{{main|Battle of Eylau}}
In early February 1807, the Russian army, under the command of [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], was in full retreat while being pursued by [[Napoléon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[Grande Armée]]''.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_eylau.html|title=Battle of Eylau|publisher=History of War|author=Rickard, J.|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field armies of Russia's ally, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], had been decisively defeated by the ''Grande Armée'' at the double [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]] on 14 October 1806. This left the Russian army as the only major land force opposing Napoléon in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]].&lt;ref name=series&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_eylau.html#14|title=French Cavalry at Eylau, 1807 and Napoleon's Cavalry Doctrine|publisher=Napoleon Series|author=Beorn, Cadet|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some failed attempts to disrupt the French advance, Bennigsen decided to regroup his retreating forces at the Prussian village of Eylau (now [[Bagrationovsk]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchempire.net/battles/eylau/|title=Battle of Eylau|publisher=French Empire|author=Jensen, Nathan D.|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting began in the afternoon of 7 February when Napoleon's baggage section arrived at Eylau in preparation for the Emperor's arrival, unaware of the Russian presence still in the village. Thinking the French were attempting to capture the village, Bennigsen sent reinforcements to Eylau; Napoléon reciprocated with his own fighting force. Intense engagements followed, especially around the village's church and cemetery, but the French held control of Eylau by the end of the day.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=series/&gt;

The Russians countered in the early morning of 8 February with a massive [[artillery]] bombardment. On the brink of a disastrous defeat, Napoléon called upon the [[Reserve Cavalry Corps (Grande Armée)|Reserve Cavalry Corps]] to [[cavalry charge|charge]] the Russian columns approaching Eylau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/napoleon-vs-russia-battle-of-eylau/|title=Napoleon Vs Russia: Battle of Eylau|publisher=Warfare History Network|author=Hawkins, Jenkins|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It disrupted the Russian offensive long enough for the French lines to stabilize. By nightfall, Bennigsen ordered his forces to withdraw: the French, though able to declare a victory, were left with a snowy battlefield riddled with blood and frozen corpses.&lt;ref name=series/&gt;

== Commission ==
Napoléon sought to ensure that the victory at Eylau, though costly, would not be forgotten, entrusting the director of the [[Louvre]] [[Vivant Denon]] with commissioning an artist as a part of a much larger propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/napoleon-visiting-the-battlefield-at-eylau-9-february-1807/|title=NAPOLEON VISITING THE BATTLEFIELD AT EYLAU, 9 FEBRUARY, 1807|publisher=Napoleon Foundation|author=Huguenaud, Karine|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the battle, Denon announced a public competition for the commission: 26 artists sent in their sketches which were exhibited at the Louvre. [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] was declared the winner on 13 June, and completed ''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' during the winter of 1807–1808.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; According to François de Vergnette, Denon stipulated much of what was to be featured in the painting, including "the moment to be depicted, the number of 'extras', the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format".&lt;ref name=louvre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/napoleon-battlefield-eylau|title=Napoleon at the Battle of Eylau|publisher=[[Louvre]]|author=Vergnette, François de|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting portrays Napoleon arriving outside Eylau to survey the battlefield on 9 February 1807, the day after the fighting ended. The painting is on a monumental scale of 521 x 784&amp;nbsp;cm, such that most of the central figures are rendered life-sized.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/g/gros/7eylau.html|title=Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau, 1807|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the figures on the edges of the painting are intentionally cut off to instil a feeling of the work being an actual fragment of a real-life scene. The viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the large pile of corpses in the foreground whose faces are twice life-sized; another soldier, wounded, cries out in a state of [[insanity|madness]].&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt;&lt;ref name=web/&gt; According to the ''64th Grande Armée Bulletin'', the scene was designed "to instil in princes a love of peace and a horror of war".&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

In the center of the painting Napoléon is seen mounted on a light bay horse surveying the treatment of the wounded, his hand outstretched in a pose reminiscent of [[blessing]] the soldiers. "The consoling expression of the great man", wrote Denon, "seems to soften the horrors of death and spread a softer light on this scene of carnage".&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; He is surrounded by members of his staff: [[Marshal Berthier]], [[Marshal Bessières]], and [[Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt|General Caulaincourt]] are to the left, while [[Marshal Soult]], [[Marshal Davout]] and [[Marshal Murat]] flank on the right.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; A wounded Lithuanian soldier, taken aback by the compassion of the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to Napoléon while another former combatant embraces his leg.&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==

''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' was first shown at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1809. Initially, some politicians suspected the painting aimed to portray the Emperor unfavorably, but Napoléon himself approved of Gros's work and presented him with the [[Légion d'honneur]] at the painter's award ceremony.&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt; Gros's depiction of Napoléon displayed a degree of realism not present in his earlier painting of the Emperor, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804), nor those by any other artist. In its portrayal of the unpleasant truth of war, ''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' breaks with the prevailing style of [[Neoclassicism]] and was an early landmark in the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt; Its influence is apparent in the works of French artists like [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], themselves both pioneers of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antoine-Jean-Gros|title=Antoine Jean-Gros|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''peer jury process''' is often used in the arts to assess applications for grants, proposals for exhibitions made in response to an open call for submissions and art competitions. Like the practice of [[peer review]] used in the academic sphere, a peer jury brings to an evaluation process expertise that an organization or agency awarding grants or sponsoring a competition might not itself have. 

A peer jury in the arts context is generally composed of artists selected to be representative of those working in a relevant discipline or area. While jurors are expected to have [[independence]], [[anonymity]] is less of a concern than in academic [[peer review]], in part because the jury's task is not to catch errors or offer criticism but to only to select. For example, in Canada, agencies that award grants typically publish lists of jurors or make lists available on request. 

In principle the peer jury process is an effective way for arts councils and other agencies to be responsive to and engaged with the constituencies they serve, and in touch with the latest developments in contemporary art.

'''''Rhythm of Structure''''' is a multimedia interdisciplinary project founded in 2003. It features a series of exhibitions, performances, and academic projects that explore the interconnecting structures and process of [[mathematics and art]], and language, as way to advance a movement of mathematical expression across the arts, across creative collaborative communities celebrating the rhythm and patterns of both ideas of the mind and the physical reality of nature.

==Introduction==
''Rhythm of Structure'', as an expanding series of art exhibitions, performances, videos/films and publications created and curated by multimedia mathematical artist and writer [[John Sims (artist)|John Sims]], explores and celebrates the intersecting [[structure]]s of mathematics, art, community, and nature.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Q&amp;A: John Sims on mathematical art|journal=Nature|date=15 April 2010|volume=464|page=983|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/464983a.pdf?origin=ppub|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bombmagazine"&gt;{{cite web |author1=A.M. Weaver |title=John Sims by A.M. Weaver |url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/john-sims/ |website=BOMB |accessdate=12 June 2018 |date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sims also created ''Recoloration Proclamation'' featuring the installation, [[The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Sims|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/john-sims-|website=HuffPost|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Sims|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/john-sims/|website=Bomb|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From his catalog essay from the ''Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic exhibition'', Sims sets the curatorial theme where he writes: "Mathematics, as a parameter of human consciousness in an indispensable conceptual technology, essential is seeing beyond the retinal and knowing beyond the intuitive. The language and process of mathematics, as elements of, foundation for art, inform an analytic expressive condition that inspires a visual reckoning for a convergence: from the illustrative to the metaphysical to the poetic. And in the dialectic of visual art call and text performative response, there is an inter-dimensional conversation where the twisting structures of language, vision and human ways give birth to the spiritual lattice of a social geometry, a community constructivism -- a place of connections, where emotional calculations meet spirited abstraction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Sims|title=Rhythm of Structure Catalogue - A John Sims Project|date=Oct 8, 2011|publisher=Selby Gallery, Ringling College of Art and Design|page=7|url=https://issuu.com/mathartist/docs/testcata1|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First premiering at the Fire Patrol No.5 Gallery in 2003, with the show ''Rhythm of Structure: MathArt'' in [[Harlem]]. This interdisciplinary project has featured numerous exhibitions around the country collaborating with many notable artists, writers, and musicians including: [[Sol Lewitt]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Alvin D. Loving|Al Loving]],[[Joe Overstreet]], [[Howardena Pindell]], [[Helaman Ferguson]], [[John A. Hiigli|John Hiigli]], [[Vandorn Hinnant]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Dread Scott]], [[DJ Spooky|Paul D. Miller]], [[Bob Holman]], Kate Rushin, [[Roman Verostko]], Joan Waltemath, [[Tara Betts]], [[Brent Collins]], Mike Field, Kazmier Maslanka, Ken Hiratsuka, Yael Acher Moriano, [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Kristin Prevallet]], John Sims, and former U.S. Poet Laureate [[Mark Strand]].&lt;ref name="bathshebagrossman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shows |url=https://www.bathsheba.com/artist/shows.html |website=Bathsheba Sculpture |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agnesdenes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exhibitions |url=http://www.agnesdenesstudio.com/exhibitions.html |website=Agnes Denes |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the exhibitions, another major aim of ''Rhythm of Structure'' is the building of a interdisciplinary creative community around the intersection of mathematics and all forms of art, as it might inspire new art, innovation art and mathematics education, and increased respect and understanding of the [[rhythm]] and structure of nature itself. Such community experiences are created through call and response performances, social media and special video music projects such as The Rhythm of Structure and The Pi Day Anthem featuring John Sims and Vi Hart .&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection|url=http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1085|website=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pi Day Anthem: Mathematics, Art and Beyond|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-sims-/pi-day-mathematics-art-an_b_9411708.html|website=HuffPost|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhythm of Structure has its beginnings in Sims’ work as one of the international curators for the exhibition ''Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences'', a city wide exhibition, in conjunction with the [[UNESCO#General Conference|UNESCO-ICSU World Conference of Science]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/artsci.html|website=Doug Dunham|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A World of Science|journal=UNESCO|date=Oct 2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=6|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001307/130715e.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to the exhibition, ''MathArt/ArtMath'', curated by John Sims (then Coordinator of Mathematics at Ringling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist John Sims to explore correlation between quilting, math, community|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2014/10/23/Artist+John+Sims+to+explore+correlation+between+quilting,+math,+community|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acclaimed "Math Artist" John Sims to speak at Texas State|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2005/04/Sims041105.html|website=Texas State|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kevin Dean, at the Selby Gallery [[Ringling College of Art and Design]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="creativeloafing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Numbers Man |url=https://www.cltampa.com/arts-entertainment/article/20721530/numbers-man |website=Creative Loafing Tampa Bay |accessdate=11 June 2018 |date=21 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Art And The Mathematical Instinct |date=2004 |publisher=Tweed Museum Of Art, University of Minnesota |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iLPpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Mathart/artmath%22&amp;dq=%22Mathart/artmath%22|isbn=9781889523279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artist John Sims not coming to campus, but exhibit still planned at Gettysburg College |url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=806fcc2d-7ed5-4338-bdbc-67845b9a648e |website=News @ Gettysburg |accessdate=13 June 2018 |date=30 Aug 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show presented a general survey of art inspired and framed by mathematics ideas of mostly American [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] artists, as well as mathematicians working in the area of visual mathematics. The theme of the show was designed to examine the complexity and diversity of the meaning of [[Mathematics and art|mathematical art]].&lt;ref name="creativeloafing" /&gt; The ''MathArt/ArtMath'' exhibition featured: [[Josef Albers]], [[Thomas Banchoff]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Manuelo Baez, [[Jhane Barnes]], [[Max Bill]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Brent Collins]], David Davis, [[George Deem]], [[Agnes Denes]], [[M.C.

After the ''MathArt/ArtMath'' exhibition, Sims began working on a text about the nature of mathematical art leading to his chapter, ''Trees, Roots and a Brain: A Metaphorical Foundation for Mathematical Art'', in the book ''Mathematics and Culture II: Visual Perfection: Mathematics and Creativity''. In his chapter, he presents his ideas on the interconnection of mathematics, [[Environmental art|art and nature]], setting the stage for his next group of exhibitions called ''Rhythm of Structure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics and Culture II |date=2005 |publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-26443-9 |pages=163–170 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26443-4_14 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NYU course==
In the spring of 2010, in connection to the ''Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection'' at the Bowery Poetry Club, John Sims was invited to teach a course for the department of Art and Public Policy at [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. The course, "Rhythm of Structure: Trees, Flags and Clock", examined the mechanisms/structures of developing John Sims' three large-scale interdisciplinary art projects (as case studies), which explored issues of social justice, community building, and the politics of grand scale works. With these multi-level projects-in-progress, which intersect the space of art with mathematics, visual politics, and social networking,  the course investigated the various strategies and challenges in creating a system of objects-texts-sounds-works that employs the tools of social organizing, media, technology, [[culture jamming]], performance, poetry, and satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art &amp; Public Policy: Past Courses |url=http://tisch.nyu.edu/art-public-policy/courses/course-archive |website=NYU Tisch |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtubestructureclass"&gt;{{cite web |title=MathArtPoem by John Sims and Rhythm of Structure Class |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGFdqHEGA9U |website=YouTube |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kremlin Armoury 1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Silver]] [[goblet]] presented to the Tsar of [[Russia]] by [[John III Sobieski]] King of [[Poland]], 17th century, over 1m height.]]
A '''silversmith''' is a [[Master craftsman|craftsman]] who crafts objects from [[silver]]. The terms "silversmith" and "[[goldsmith]]" are not exactly [[synonyms]] as the techniques, training, history, and [[guild]]s are or were largely the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects created. However most goldsmiths have also worked in silver although the reverse may not be the case.

Silversmithing is the art of turning silver [[sheetmetal|sheet metal]] into [[hollowware|hollow ware]] ([[Dishware|dish]]es, [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[porringer]]s, [[cup]]s, [[candlestick]]s, [[vase]]s, [[ewer]]s, [[urn]]s, etc.), [[cutlery|flatware]] (silverware), and other articles of [[silver (household)|household silver]], church plate or sculpture. It may also include the making of [[jewellery|jewelry]].

==History==
[[File:John Singleton Copley - Paul Revere - WGA5216.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere]] with a silver teapot and some of his engraving tools.]]
In the ancient Near East the value of silver to gold being less, allowed a silversmith to produce objects and store these as stock. Ogden states that according to an edict written by Diocletian in 301 A.D., a silversmith was able to charge 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 ''denarii'' for material produce (per Roman pound). At that time, guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes, protect its members' welfare and educate the public of the trade.&lt;ref name=" Ogden"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCBt7B7nt5QC&amp;pg=PA58 |author=Jack Ogden |title=Ancient Jewellery | year= |publisher=University of California Press, 7 July 1992| accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silversmiths in medieval Europe and England formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the [[apprentice]] tradition.  Silver working guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation.  Beginning in the 17th century, artisans emigrated to America and experienced fewer restrictions.  As a result, silver working was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the [[Technological and industrial history of the United States#Silverworking|shift to industrialization]] in America.

Very exquisite and distinctly designed silverware, that goes by the name of [[Swami silver|Swami Silver]], emerged from the stable of watchmaker turned silversmith [[P.Orr &amp; Sons|P Orr and Sons]] in the South Indian city of Madras (now Chennai) during the British rule in 1875.

The [[Falasha Clan]] , or Beta Israel, of Ethiopia were known for their silversmithing skills.

Silversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock, and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it 'work-hardens'. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] is the heat-treatment used to make the metal soft again. If metal is work-hardened, and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.

Silversmiths can use [[casting]] techniques to create knobs, handles and feet for the hollowware they are making.

After forming and casting, the various pieces may be assembled by [[solder]]ing and [[rivet]]ing.

During most of their history, silversmiths used [[charcoal]] or [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fired [[forge]]s, and lung-powered [[Blowpipe (tool)|blow-pipe]]s for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is [[laser beam welding]].

Silversmiths may also work with [[copper]] and [[brass]], especially when making practice pieces, due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver.

== Related and overlapping trades ==
[[File:Silver band.png|thumb|upright|right|Band made of silver]]

Although [[jeweler]]s also work in silver and gold, and many of the techniques for working [[precious metal]]s overlap, the trades of jeweler and Silversmith have distinct histories.
[[Chain]]-making and [[Gemstone|gem]]-setting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths.

The tradition of making ([[iron]] / plate) [[armor]] was interrupted sometime after the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Silversmithing and goldsmithing, by contrast, have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia. The techniques used to make armor today (whether for [[movie]]s or for historical recreation groups) are an amalgam of silversmith forming techniques and [[blacksmith]] iron-handling techniques.

== Canadian observations ==
In the western Canadian silversmith tradition, guilds do not exist; however, mentoring through colleagues becomes a method of professional learning within a community of craftspersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the native Canadian western tradition, silversmithing is done through hand tooling and bright cut engraving of silver.  There are silversmiths who only make jewellery and there are silversmiths who only make utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Soultaker''''' is a 1990 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[horror film]] written by [[Vivian Schilling]] and directed by Michael Rissi. It stars [[Joe Estevez]] in the title role, alongside Vivian Schilling, Gregg Thomsen, Chuck Williams, [[Robert Z'Dar]], and [[David "Shark" Fralick]]. The film follows a group who try to flee from the 'Soultaker' when their souls are ejected from their bodies after a car accident.

The film received positive reviews from [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], but received negative criticism for its story and special effects. It won the [[Saturn Award]] for "Best Genre Video Release" in 1992. A sequel was planned and actors such as [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] were named for the cast, but the sequel was never made and Schilling turned its premise into a novel. ''Soultaker'' was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

==Plot ==
During a summer festival, The Angel of Death ([[Robert Z'Dar]]) instructs his "Soultaker" subordinate ([[Joe Estevez]]) to kill five people: Zack (Gregg Thomsen), Zack's friends Brad ([[David "Shark" Fralick]]) and Tommy (Chuck Williams), Brad's girlfriend Candice (Cinda Lou Freeman), and Zack's ex-girlfriend Natalie ([[Vivian Schilling]]). The Soultaker notices a striking resemblance between Natalie and his lover, whom he killed in his former life. After Natalie's friend leaves her behind, Zack offers her a ride home in Brad's car. Brad is high on cocaine and reluctant to drive Natalie; he drives at high speed before crashing to avoid hitting the Soultaker. Candice dies instantly while Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy's souls leave their bodies. The Soultaker takes Candice's soul and informs the Angel of Death, who orders the Soultaker to recover the other souls. Thinking they survived the crash, the four return to the car, unaware their bodies were taken to a hospital. While investigating the car, the Soultaker reveals himself and claims Brad's soul; the others, helpless to stop him, flee.

The others run into a convenience store, where attempt to tell the cashier—who cannot see them—someone is after them. While inside, they see a news report surrounding the events of the crash. This confuses the trio, and Natalie accuses Zack of knowing Brad was on drugs. They leave the store and make a 911 call but the operator hangs up on them. The Soultaker appears and grabs Natalie to claim her soul but her resemblance to his past lover stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. The Angel of Death reprimands his subordinate for failing to take Natalie. The Soultaker later takes Brad and Tommy's soul.

Zack and Natalie go to Natalie's house, where Zack and Natalie tell her mother Anna (Jean Reiner) about the Soultaker. Zack and Natalie reconcile while Anna goes to run a bath for Natalie. While Natalie bathes, her mother watches her behind the bathroom door. Zack is watching television when news of the crash is shown. Natalie's father Mayor Grant (David Fawcett) announces live that the life support systems of Natalie and Zack will be turned off at midnight. During the news broadcast, Natalie's mother appears onscreen; at the same time, the "mother" watching Natalie suddenly morphs into the Soultaker. He attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life on condition that she stays by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is overpowered. Natalie tries to shoots the Soultaker with no effect. Natalie tells the Soultaker she wants to be with Zack and the Soultaker throws Zack out of the window. Zack survives the fall.

Natalie and Zack escape and flee to the hospital, hoping to return to their bodies before midnight. Natalie is captured by the Soultaker on an elevator that leads to the afterlife; he claims he is an angel charged with collecting souls. He persuades Natalie there is nothing left for her in living realm, that Zack is already dead, and that she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a Soultaker. Brad tells him that people who kill someone—even by accident—must pay for it with service as a grim reaper. With Brad's help, Zack enters the afterlife and rescues Natalie. Brad gives Zack two empty soul rings to help Zack and Natalie return to their bodies.

They find Natalie's body and she places herself in the ring but remains comatose. Zack discovers that a pendant she was wearing acted as a barrier between her soul and her body. He pulls her soul from her body to reattempt the process when the Soultaker reappears. After a chase around the hospital, Zack is cornered on the roof and escapes by leaping off. The Soultaker is confronted by the Angel of Death, who informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed. The Soultaker pleads with the Angel but is imprisoned into a soul ring by his master. Zack returns to his body and saves Natalie's life; he later visits her when she is discharged from the hospital.

==Production==
''Soultaker'' was written by [[Vivian Schilling]]. Inspiration for the film came in discussions between  Schilling and [[Action International Pictures]] producer Eric Parkinson. Schilling based her script on a real-life car-accident event that happened to her and a friend.&lt;ref name="Femme"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Winter 1992-1993|title=Vivian Schilling|pages=40–45|last=Thonen|first=John|volume=1|issue=5|url=https://archive.org/stream/Femme_Fatales_v01n03#page/n41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was written in the span of four months.&lt;ref name="Fangoria"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|last=McDonagh|first=Maitland|issue=102|page=29|title=Baring Her Soul|date=May 1991|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_102_1991_Nagus_Joined_Poster_Fix_incl_c2c#page/n25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Joe Estevez]] starred as the titular "Soultaker";  Originally he was asked to play the Mayor, Grant McMillan.{{sfn|Paulson|Watson|2012}} As well as writing the script for the film, Vivian Schilling played the female lead Natalie McMillan. Schilling had previously acted in [[Fred Olen Ray]]'s ''[[Prison Ship]]'' and a nurse in the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt;

I always felt lucky to have lived through that, but it also made me wonder. What if I was supposed to die and didn't know it?|author=[[Vivian Schilling]]|source=''[[Fangoria]]''&lt;ref name="Fangoria"/&gt;}}

''Soultaker'' was shot in [[Mobile, Alabama]], in five weeks with a budget of $250,000.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-30/entertainment/ca-414_1_michael-rissi-film|title=O.C.

''Soultaker'' was his first main feature; he had previously directed the 1987 short film ''Snake Eyes'', which became part of the anthology movie ''Terror Eyes'', which Eric Parkinson and Vivian Schilling were also involved with.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Originally reluctant to direct, Rissi decided to join after being interested in directing a film involving [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s. Rissi's contributions to the film resulted in it being released as "A Michael Rissi Film" for both the promotional material and film credits.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;

Problems mounted during production. In an interview with ''[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]'', Vivian Schilling noted that almost a third of the script had to be re-written because of time and money constraints.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Schilling later wrote an article for the magazine about a scene not written by her but added by investors and the film crew, in which she was asked to appear naked. Despite claims it would increase sales for the film, Schilling avoided appearing nude in the scene.&lt;ref name="Femme3"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Fall 1994|title=Vivian Schilling: Exposing Myself On Film|last=Schilling|first=Vivian|author-link=Vivian Schilling|pages=61–62|volume=3|issue=2|url=https://archive.org/stream/Femme_Fatales_v03n02#page/n61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of the car-crash scene, the car could not be started, causing the loss of a half-day's production.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;

==Release==
''Soultaker'' was distributed by Action International Pictures. Originally planned to be released [[straight to video]], it received a limited theatrical release; eight prints of it were distributed in the United States on October 26, 1990.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/90925/Soultaker/misc-notes.html|title=Soultaker - Miscellaneous Notes|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivian Schilling said the movie was successful in theaters but flopped in her hometown, [[Witchita, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; ''Soultaker'' was released on [[VHS]] on January 24, 1991.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM"/&gt; It was also released on [[DVD]] by Imagine Entertainment in 1999 and [[Hannover House]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/soultaker-v45738/releases|title=Soultaker (1990) - Releases|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Critical reception for ''Soultaker'' has been mostly negative, with criticism directed at the film's story, and special effects.
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Mark Chalon Smith unfavorably compared ''Soultaker'' to 1968's ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', both of which were made with a small budget. Smith said having a small budget "doesn't necessarily mean a movie can't be fun and scary" but ''Soultaker'' was not fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-30/entertainment/ca-413_1_soultaker-movie-fun|title=O.

[[Michael Dare]] of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] directed praise towards the film in his review, calling it a "good looking, low-budget fantasy thriller", though he noted the film cast's [[overacting]] and its transformation into "several layers of advanced silliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Dare|first=Michael|date=November 24, 1990|page=52|title=Book Space For `Grim' Stories &amp; Other `Tall' Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Larry Cohn spoke positively about ''Soultaker'', comparing its portrayal of the afterlife to be more consistent than the film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media]]|last=Cohn|first=Larry|title=Soultaker|date=November 5, 1990|volume=341|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'']] also called the film a "[[micro-budget]] variation on ''Ghost'', criticizing the special effects and Michael Rissi's direction, but praising Vivian Schilling for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/soultaker|title=Soultaker, directed by Michael Rissi|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the film later won the "Best Genre Video Release" award during the [[18th Saturn Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991sat.htm|title=1991 18th Saturn Awards|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017175735/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991sat.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
A sequel was planned for the movie; it went through name changes from "Dark Angel" to "Dark World". Producers planned to cast [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in one iteration of the production, and [[Donald Sutherland]] was also in talks.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Robert Z'Dar commented that [[William Shatner]] was interested in playing the boss of Z'Dar's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Gorezone|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|title=Behind the Bloody Badge: Maniac Cop|last=Barsky|first=Larry|issue=18|date=Summer 1991|page=12|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gorezone_018_Summer_1991_with_Posters_HQS_c2c#page/n11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Tibor Takács (director)|Tibor Takács]] was due to direct the project and production was planned for January 1993 in Canada.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Eventually, the concept of the unmade script was turned a novel; Schilling said she "embellished the premise" and added new characters to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Winter 1992-1993|title=Vivian Schilling|pages=40–45|last=Thonen|first=John|volume=1|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mystery Science Theater 3000''===
''Soultaker'' was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (''MST3K''), a comedy television series in which the character [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] and his two robot friends [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]] are forced to watch 'bad films' as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was broadcast on the [[Sci-Fi Channel]] on April 11, 1999. The episode also saw the guest appearances of series creator and original host of ''MST3K'' [[Joel Hodgson]] as [[Joel Robinson]] and [[Frank Conniff]] as [[TV's Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|title=Mystery Science Theatre: Season Ten on the Satellite of Love launches after news of show's demise|date=May 1999|last=Cziraky|first=Dan|page=6|volume=31|number=5|url=https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Cinefantastique/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2031%20No%205%20%28May%201999%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/old-new-hosts-launch-mst-3000-season-article-1.824636|title=Old &amp; New Hosts Launch 'MST 3000' Season|last=Bianculli|first=David|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=April 9, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805223558/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/old-new-hosts-launch-mst-3000-season-article-1.824636|archivedate=August 5, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes comparing Vivian Schilling to [[Tonya Harding]] were made.

{{Intellectual property}}
{{European patent law}}
In the [[European Economic Area]] ([[European Union]] member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), a '''supplementary protection certificate''' ('''SPC''') is a ''[[sui generis]]'' intellectual property (IP) right that extends the duration of certain rights associated with a patent. It enters into force after expiry of a patent upon which it is based. This type of right is available for various regulated, biologically active agents, namely human or veterinary medicaments and plant protection products (e.g. [[insecticide]]s, and [[herbicide]]s). Supplementary protection certificates were introduced to encourage innovation by compensating for the long time needed to obtain regulatory approval of these products (i.e. authorisation to put these products on the market).&lt;ref&gt;"''... Whereas at the moment the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorization to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research ...''" in [http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992R1768:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products]&lt;/ref&gt;

A supplementary protection certificate comes into force only after the corresponding general patent expires. It normally has a maximum lifetime of 5 years. The duration of the SPC can, however, be extended to 5.5 years when the SPC relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) have been submitted (as set out in Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1901/reg_2006_1901_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The total combined duration of market exclusivity of a general patent and SPC cannot normally exceed 15 years. However, the reward of a 6-month SPC extension for the submission of data from an agreed PIP can extend this combined duration to 15.5 years.

SPCs extend the monopoly period for a "product" (active ingredient or a combination of active ingredients) that is protected by a patent. For many SPC applications, there is no controversy about the definition of the "product" or whether it is protected by the patent upon which the SPC application was based. However, there are other SPC applications (particularly for medicinal products containing multiple active ingredients) where there may not be clear answers to questions such as what is a permissible definition of a "product", and what test should be applied for determining whether a patent protects that "product".

Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union are based primarily upon two [[European Union regulation|regulation]]s. Although all countries in the EU are required to provide supplementary protection certificates, no unified cross-recognition exist. Applications must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis.

== Scope ==
According to Article 4 of [[Council of the European Union|Council]] Regulation ([[European Community|EEC]]) No 1768/92, the scope of an SPC extends "''only to the product covered by the authorization to place the corresponding medicinal product on the market and for any use of the product as a medicinal product that has been authorized before the expiry of the certificate''".

The European Court of Justice has decided, however, that the scope of an SPC is sometimes capable of encompassing more than just the single form of the active ingredient that is included in the medicinal product authorised for sale. Thus, in case C-392/97,&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docop=docop&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;typeord=ALL&amp;docnodecision=docnodecision&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=C-392%2F97&amp;ddatefs=&amp;mdatefs=&amp;ydatefs=&amp;ddatefe=&amp;mdatefe=&amp;ydatefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Farmitalia Carlo Erba Srl's SPC Application (Case C-392/97)]&lt;/ref&gt; the European Court of Justice held that:
"''where an active ingredient in the form of a salt is referred to in the marketing authorisation concerned and is protected by a basic patent in force, the certificate is capable of covering the active ingredient as such and also its various derived forms such as salts and esters, as medicinal products, in so far as they are covered by the protection of the basic patent''".

== Legal basis ==
Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union were based primarily upon two regulations:

* [[Council of the European Union|Council]] Regulation ([[European Community|EEC]]) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992R1768:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products]&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 2 January 1993. This has been cancelled by the below specified recodified regulation No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF 469/2009] with effect from May 2009
* Regulation ([[European Community|EC]]) No 1610/96 of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996R1610:EN:HTML Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products]&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 8 February 1997

The above Regulations have now been codified under the following regulation:
* Regulation ([[European Community|EC]]) No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF 469/2009] of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementary protection certificates may come into life at the expiry of a national or European patent. However, the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) needed to be modified to allow such "extension" of the term of European patent. Article 63 of the EPC was modified on 17 December 1991 to specify to, although European patents have a [[term of patent|term]] of 20 years as from the date of filing of the application (Art. 63(1)),

:" nothing (...) shall limit the right of a Contracting State to extend the term of a European patent, or to grant corresponding protection which follows immediately on expiry of the term of the patent, under the same conditions as those applying to national patents: (...)
:(b) if the subject-matter of the European patent is a product or a process of manufacturing a product or a use of a product which has to undergo an administrative authorisation procedure required by law before it can be put on the market in that State. " &lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This constituted the first revision of the European Patent Convention since its signature in 1973.

The paediatric extension is based primarily upon:

* Regulation 1901/2006 of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1901/reg_2006_1901_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regulation 1902/2006 of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1902/reg_2006_1902_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1902/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determination of term ==
The term of an SPC depends on the date of issuance of the first marketing authorization (MA) within the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and can be determined by the equation:
:Term = '''date of 1st MA in the EEA &amp;minus; date of filing of corresponding patent &amp;minus; 5 years'''

Under normal circumstances, this means the following.
* No SPC term is available if less than 5 years have elapsed between the date of filing of the corresponding patent and the date of issuance of the first MA in the EEA.
* If the first MA is issued more than five years but less than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a term corresponding to the period elapsed between the five-year point and the MA issuance date.
* If the first MA is issued more than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a five-year term.

There have been very few cases where there was any controversy over the precise date of the 1st MA in the EEA. The Hässle AB case (ECJ case C-127/00&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docdecision=docdecision&amp;docop=docop&amp;docppoag=docppoag&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;radtypeord=on&amp;typeord=ALL&amp;docnodecision=docnodecision&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=C-127%2F00&amp;ddatefs=&amp;mdatefs=&amp;ydatefs=&amp;ddatefe=&amp;mdatefe=&amp;ydatefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-127/00]&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of that small number. In that case, the ECJ ruled that the decisive date for SPC purposes is the date of an authorisation from a regulatory body tasked with assessing safety and efficacy, and not the date of a subsequent authorisation that may be required under national pricing or reimbursement provisions.

So-called "centralised" ([[European Medicines Agency]] / European Commission) MAs were introduced by Regulation 2309/93&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/reg_1993_2309/reg_1993_2309_en.pdf Regulation 2309/93]&lt;/ref&gt; and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 years after the introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with "centralised" authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the date of notification of that decision to the MA applicant.  Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1).  Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/every-day-counts-but-how-do-we-count.html Mike Snodin October 2011 article]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a "centralised" authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.

The UK Intellectual Property Office has now accepted Snodin's arguments on this point and has changed its standard practice regarding the calculation of SPC term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/p-law/p-pn/p-pn-spcduration.htm UK IPO Practice Notice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173040/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/p-law/p-pn/p-pn-spcduration.htm |date=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains to be seen whether any other national offices will follow suit. However, inspection of Belgian SPC certificates for products authorised via the "centralised" procedure reveals that at least the patent office in Belgium already appears to base calculations of SPC term upon date (2). Thus, there are divergent practices across different territories within Europe with regard to the selection of a date for a "centralised" MA, with Belgium and the UK IPO being in the minority. If the issue were ever to be debated in a national court, this fact that there are divergent practices across different territories could provide basis for such a court to seek an authoratitive ruling from the ECJ in relation to which of dates (1) and (2) should be used for SPCs. This is because, as European Commission legislation, the Regulations governing SPCs should be interpreted consistently across all member states of the EU.

An MA in [[Switzerland]] was also considered as being a first MA for the calculation of the SPC duration, even though Switzerland is not part of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). This is because such a MA was automatically effective in [[Liechtenstein]], which is a member of the EEA (since 1 May 1995). This was decided by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) in joined cases ''Novartis et al. v. Comptroller-General'' and ''Ministère de l'Economie v. Millennium Pharmaceuticals''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/c_158/c_15820030705en00170017.pdf Case C-207/03]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/c_200/c_20020030823en00120012.pdf Case C-252/03]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same point was also confirmed in case C-617/12 (''AstraZeneca AB v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=144849&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=288106 Case C-617/12]&lt;/ref&gt; in a case where the data that persuaded Swissmedic to grant the (earlier) Swiss MA was held by the European Medicines Agency to not be complete or persuasive enough to justify the grant of a MA under EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC).
However, as answer to the decision of the ECJ the contract between Switzerland and Liechtenstein was amended. Since 1 July 2005 the automatic effect of a Swiss MA in Liechtenstein is abolished. The recognition is now delayed by a time period, which is normally 12 months.

=== Paediatric extension ===
Article 36 of Regulation 1901/2006 provides for a 6-month extension to SPC term. The extension is available only under certain conditions, the most notable being the requirement for the submission of a new MA application containing data from all trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).

Consequences of the 6-month SPC extension include:
* the maximum term of an SPC can now be up to 5.5 years; and
* the maximum duration of market exclusivity (patent + SPC) can now be up to at least 15.5 years.

An extension of an SPC can only be awarded if there is an SPC to extend.  As an unextended SPC only has a positive term if more than 5 years have elapsed between patent filing and MA issuance, this leads to the following two questions.

(1) Is an SPC available if less than 5 years and 1 day have elapsed between filing of the corresponding patent and issuance of the first MA in the EEA?

(2) If the answer to (1) is yes, what term should be awarded to the (unextended) SPC?

A July 2007 paper by Snodin and Miles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.potterclarkson.com/pdfs/newsletters/making-the-most-of-paediatric-spc-extensions.pdf Snodin and Miles ''RAJ Pharma'' 18(7), 459 (2007)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127093250/http://www.potterclarkson.com/pdfs/newsletters/making-the-most-of-paediatric-spc-extensions.pdf |date=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward three possible answers to this combination of two questions.

If the answer to question (1) is no, then it is not relevant to consider question (2). This corresponds to "Model B" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper, and produces a curious situation where longer marketing exclusivity can be obtained if the issuance of the first MA in the EEA is delayed (to at least 5 years and 1-day from filing of the corresponding patent).

If the answer to question (1) is yes, then question (2) becomes relevant. This question can be answered in two ways, corresponding to either "Model A" or "Model C" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper.

Model A assumes that SPC term can validly be either zero or negative if 5 years or less have elapsed from filing of the corresponding patent to issuance of the first MA in the EEA. In this event, a positive (and non-zero) SPC term is obtained (after extension) if the time from patent filing to MA issuance is more than 4.5 years.

Model C assumes that all term calculations that provide a negative answer are 'rounded up' to zero. This has the consequence of providing a minimum of 6 months of SPC term, irrespective of how little time has elapsed from patent filing to MA issuance.

Subsequent to the publication of the Snodin and Miles article, Merck &amp; Co. filed SPC applications for the product [[sitagliptin]]. For example, from mid-August to mid-September 2007, Merck &amp; Co. filed SPC applications in various countries, including the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-spc-byspc-results.htm?number=SPC/GB07/046 Register Extract for UK SPC for sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentsoffice.ie/eregister/register/SPRegister.aspx?idappli=2007/029  Register Extract for IE SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.octrooicentrum.nl/register/gegevens/CERT/300287  Register Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info&amp;id=1541780&amp;table=CCP  Register Extract for IT SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; These SPC applications provided an early opportunity for Models A to C to be tested in practice. Curiously, the patent offices of various EU member states did not reach any consensus on which model is correct. For example, the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.octrooicentrum.nl/register/gegevens/CERT/300287 Register Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin, showing an SPC expiry date earlier than the expiry date of the basic patent]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/pro-p-os/o10808.pdf UKIPO decision granting negative term SPC]&lt;/ref&gt; favoured Model A, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/full-translation-of-german-sitagliptin.html Translation of referral from BGH to the CJEU in Merck's appeal against refusal of sitagliptin SPC application in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal and Slovenia favoured Model B and Greece&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/sitagliptin-nl-negative-term.html Commentary on SPC applications for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; favoured Model C.

In connection with an appeal against refusal of the SPC application in Germany, and in view of the different stances taken by different national patent offices, the [[German Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'') sought clarification of the law from the Court of Justice of the EU (in case C-125/10).

The decision of the Court of Justice, delivered on 8 December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;jur=C,T,F&amp;num=C-125/10&amp;td=ALL C-125/10 – Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber) of 8 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; essentially agreed with Model A of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper. Thus, useful (extended) supplementary protection can now be obtained so long as at least 4 years, 6 months and one day has elapsed from the date of patent filing to the date of the first MA for the product in the EEA.

== Case law ==
ECJ cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 effectively ruled that SPCs for medicaments (human or veterinary) are only available for those "products" that:

(a) are protected by a patent;

(b) have been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure; and

(c) have not been placed on the market anywhere in the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] as a medicinal product prior to being subject to safety and efficacy testing and a regulatory review.

Until recently, decisions C-195/09 and C-427/09 could have been interpreted as ruling out the possibility of SPC protection for all "products" previously included in medicinal products that were marketed prior to the date(s) of the Marketing Authorisation(s) (MA(s)) specified in the SPC application. This is because the ECJ's rulings in C-195/09 and C-427/09 were based in part upon a desire to ensure that national patent offices are not required to assess whether an earlier MA was compliant with the standards for testing of safety and efficacy that were introduced in the 1970s (meaning that all prior MAs, whether or not compliant with those standards, should be treated equally under the SPC legislation).

However, the decision in Neurim Pharmaceuticals (C-130/11) has cast doubt upon this interpretation. In C-130/11, the ECJ held that an SPC can be granted regardless of the prior marketing of earlier (veterinary) medicinal products containing the "product" in question. Thus, cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 (which, in common with C-130/11, related to SPC applications based upon newly patented uses for old "products") could perhaps now be viewed as being of relevance only to those "products" that were marketed before being subject to a regulatory review. However, this might necessitate patent offices making a determination of whether prior MAs are compliant with current standards (i.e. whether the "product" had been subject to safety and efficacy testing prior to being granted an MA). As this is precisely the kind of determination that the ECJ had previously been keen for patent offices to avoid, further references to the ECJ may be necessary to clarify precisely which "products" fall within the scope of the SPC legislation and which do not.

With respect to (a) above, the question of how to determine whether a "product" is protected by a patent is the subject of ongoing controversy. Cases such as C-322/10 and C-422/10 have indicated that the "product" needs to be "specified [or identified] in the wording of the claims". However, the precise meaning of this test is yet to be clarified.

Further, although the SPC legislation mentions only Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC as the "administrative authorisation procedure" for human or veterinary medicaments, SPCs are known to have been granted when MAs have not been obtained via those procedures (but instead via procedures that involve a similar level of safety and efficacy testing)[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/spc-on-basis-of-ma-for-active.html].

== Statistics ==
According to research, more than 8,000 SPCs for medicinal and plant protection products have been filed in Europe between 1991 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;EurActiv, [http://www.euractiv.com/en/health/eu-ruling-extension-pharma-patents-harder/article-154974 ''EU ruling makes extension of pharma patents harder''], 5 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flag''''' is a painting by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] (1918), that represents her anxiety about her brother being sent to fight in Europe during [[World War I]], a war that was particularly dangerous due to the uses of new and especially dangerous weapons and tactics, like [[mustard gas]], [[naval mine]]s, high-powered guns, and [[Aviation in World War I|aerial combat]]. It was not displayed until 1968, in part because anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; It is in  the collection of the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!387953~!0#focus|title=The Flag|website=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.mam.org/details.php?id=9929|title=The Flag|website=Milwaukee Art Museum|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|text=Everything seems to be whirling or unbalanced—I'm suspended in the air—can't get my feet on the ground... I should think going to war would be a great relief from this everlasting reading about it—thinking about it—hearing talk about it—whether one believed in it or not—it is a state that exists and experiencing it in reality seems preferable to the way we are all being soaked with it second hand—it is everywhere… it's all like a bad dream.|author=—Georgia O'Keeffe in a letter to [[Paul Strand]].&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA192|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1918, O'Keeffe was in a state of depression and anxiety about the war and did not paint for three months. While she understood why it was important militarily, she found it at odds with [[humanism]] and basic [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keeffe's brother, Alexius&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; or Alexis, was stationed in a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during [[World War I]]. She visited him in the fall of 1917 before he was shipped overseas, and was anxious about his fate.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He was one of the first soldiers sent to France and did not believe that he would return to the United States alive.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; In France war had become very dangerous due to chemical and technologically advanced weapons. Poisonous gases were used against troops, which could kill, blind, or severely injure them. High-powered and long-range guns could cause significant destruction. Submarines planted mines in the seas and airplanes dropped weapons from the sky.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/arts/design/review-world-war-i-the-quick-the-dead-the-artists.html|title=World War I — The Quick.

O’Keeffe found herself at odds with people in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] about the war and was discouraged by attempts to glorify it.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She tried to persuade her male students to continue their education, rather than fight in the war&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; and she also wanted authorities to create a course for young men about the reasons and causes of war before they engaged in battle.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She created a stir when she asked a shop owner to remove Christmas cards from his shop that expressed anti-German sentiment.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; O'Keeffe became quite ill from [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which had killed an estimated 20 million people worldwide, and took a leave of absence from her teaching position at the [[West Texas State Normal College]] in early 1918 to recuperate at a friend's ranch in San Antonio,&lt;ref name="ABJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/156926133/|title=Watercolors Expand View of O'Keeffe|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|author=Malin Wilson|via=newspapers.com|date=April 16, 1998|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she painted ''The Flag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Hopkin Reily|title=Georgia O’Keeffe, A Private Friendship, Part I: Walking the Sun Prairie Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2gHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|date=December 1, 2014|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-63293-042-2|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Flag'', both a political statement and a reflection of her fears, is a red streak "bleeding into bruise-colored clouds".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In December 1917, she wrote that she felt compelled for the first time to paint from a sense of necessity. Her image for the painting was of a flag floating in the wind, similar to a tremble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgia O'Keeffe|author2=Alfred Stieglitz|title=My Faraway One: Selected Letters of Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz: Volume One, 1915–1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkuyi_Fg3YC&amp;pg=PA446|date=June 21, 2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16630-9|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Roxana Barry Robinson]] states, "O'Keeffe sets a drooping flag against a starless, darkening sky. The flag flutters limply, stripped of its stars and stripes; its only color, and that of the pole, is blood red."&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; Alexis died in France due to the effects of mustard gas.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]],&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and people living in Canyon were uneasy due to her anti-war position.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; ''The Flag'' was in the private collection of Mrs. Harry Lynde Bradley in October 25, 1968, when it was part of a [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] exhibition, and was acquired by the museum in 1977.&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt; The painting is included in the "World War I and American Art" exhibition opened by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in January 2017.

'''''The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert''''' is a 2013 American documentary film directed by [[Lisa Scafuro]] on the life &amp; work of the late Italian Architect and environmentalist [[Paolo Soleri]].

==Synopsis==
The documentary focuses on the life of influential architect, environmentalist and philosopher Paolo Soleri. An Italian native, Soleri was born in 1919 and traveled to the United States in the 40s to meet and mentor with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. During the source of the film Scafuro features several interviews and ponders what might come of mankind and architecture in a world dealing with so many crises.

==Production==
Scarfuro first showed an interest in creating a documentary about Soleri after befriending him at his studio in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=3957&amp;p=full|title=InItalia: Ideas: Interviews Lisa Scafuro On Paolo Soleri |magazine=the American Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She approached [[Ken Burns]] at the unveiling of the [[PBS]] documentary ''Frank Lloyd Wright'' with the intent of asking him to film the documentary, only for Burns to recommend that Scarfuro herself work on the documentary as he was booked up a decade in advance for projects.&lt;ref name="azc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20130926soleris-flim-influence-vision.html|title=AZCentral.com: Film explores architect Soleri’s influence, vision |newspaper=AZCentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarfuro began filming around 2004 and ended filming in early 2012. The majority of the film was shot in Arizona, with various on-camera [[interviews]] and pickup shots filmed in New York City, Washington DC (When Soleri was honored at [[The White House]]), Italy, and California. For the narration, Scafuro chose to use [[Sweden|Swedish]] musician &amp; artist [[JP White]] from the rock band [[Vains of Jenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hn.se/nojekultur/film/1.1934314-jp-white-berattare-i-dokumentarfilm?|title=Hallands Nyheter: JP White Berättare i dokumentärfilm |newspaper=Hallands Nyheter (Falkenberg, Sweden)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Vision of Paolo Soleri'' took Scafuro seven years to complete. Editing and post-production on the film was completed in mid-2013, but Soleri was able to view a rough cut of the film on his final birthday, June 21, 2012.&lt;ref name="azc" /&gt; Soleri enjoyed the film and gave it his approval, telling Scafuro  "Bravo."&lt;ref name="azc" /&gt;

==Release==
The film has so far been screened at the [[Architecture &amp; Design Film Festival]] NY,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adfilmfest.com/portal/previous_films|title=Architecture &amp; Design Film Festival: List of previously screened films}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Hope International Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newhopefilmfest.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-vision-of-paolo-soleri.html|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri at the NHIFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Sofia Independent Film Festival]] ([[Bulgaria]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soindependentfilmfest.com/2013/en/movies/view/the-vision-of-paolo-soleri-prophet-in-the-desert|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri at The Sofia Independent Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a private screening at Taliesin West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet In The Desert|url=http://www.archello.com/en/event/vision-paolo-soleri-prophet-desert|newspaper=Archello.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60296">The following is a '''list of unproduced Tim Burton projects''', in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 30 years, [[Tim Burton]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction.

==1980s==

===''After Hours''===
Burton was originally attached to direct the 1985 film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'', but [[Martin Scorsese]] read the script at a time when he was unable to get financial backing to complete ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', which was finally completed in 1988; Burton gladly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in directing ''After Hours''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=Filming for Your Life: The Making of After Hours"|type=Bonus feature|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|location=Burbank, California|id=B000286RNE|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Big Top Pee-wee''===
After the [[Pee-wee's Big Adventure|1985 film]], Burton was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salisbury|Burton|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, ''Beetlejuice''.

===''Hot to Trot''===
After the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), and before his hiring of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), [[Warner Bros.]] sent Burton various scripts. He was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality, one of them being ''[[Hot to Trot]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==

===''Conversations with Vincent''===
Burton held a fascination with [[Vincent Price]] films since his childhood. He first worked with the actor on the 1982 television film ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', and a second collaboration on the 1982 short film ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]''. During the production of ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), in which Price portrayed the inventor, Burton conceived the idea of making an independent [[documentary film]] on the actor,&lt;ref name=Vince&gt;Hanke, pp. 116, 187&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[working title]] ''Conversations with Vincent''.&lt;ref name=died&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; With self-financing from his own production company, Burton shot the film in black-and-white over a three-day period at the Vincent Price Gallery in [[East Los Angeles College]] in April 1991. In addition to Price, [[Roger Corman]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] were interviewed. ''Conversations with Vincent'' was stalled when Burton went to work on ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt; and after Price's death in October 1993.&lt;ref name=died/&gt; In December 1994 it was announced that Burton was returning to the hour-long documentary, now titled ''A Visit with Vincent''. Lucy Chase Williams, author of ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', was working as a consultant. The film likely would have been released in the [[direct-to-video]] market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304825,00.html | title = Upcoming Projects for Tim Burton and Keanu Reeves | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1994-12-09 | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was ultimately abandoned and remains unfinished.&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt;

===''Drop Dead Fred''===
Burton was offered the chance to direct ''[[Drop Dead Fred]].'' He turned it down in favor of different projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/drop-dead-fred/257794/drop-dead-fred-looking-back-on-a-cult-classic|title=Drop Dead Fred: Looking Back On A Cult Classic|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=Den of Geeks|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''===
In 1990, Burton hired writer [[Jonathan Gems]] for write a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', entitled ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19751_6-insane-sequels-that-almost-ruined-classic-movies.html|title=6 Insane Sequels That Almost Ruined Classic Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of this project. In early 1991, Burton was still interested in directing the sequel, and hired [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] to rewrite the script, but the two decided to focus on ''Batman Returns''. By  August 1993, producer [[David Geffen]] hired [[Pamela Norris]] (''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') to rewrite the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodie|first=John|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR109942.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=Twentieth, Norris-Clay ink pact|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1993-08-26|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Warner Bros. decided to hire [[Kevin Smith]] to write another script, but he turned down the offer to write the script of the unmade ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later joked that his response was "Didn't we say all we needed to say in the first ''Beetlejuice''? Must we go tropical?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying "The ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian'' script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrante|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony C. Ferrante|date=March 1997|title=Hidden Gems|work=[[Fangoria]]|pages=53–56|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], who collaborated with Burton on ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'', to write and produce a sequel to ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=KatzSmith Duo Makes First-Look Warner Bros Deal; Will Bring 'Beetlejuice' Back From Dead|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/katzsmith-duo-makes-first-look-warner-bros-deal-will-bring-beetlejuice-back-from-dead/|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." He was also adamant that [[Michael Keaton]] would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ary|first=John|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55824/|title=John Ary With A Brief Snippet Of Info Re: Beetlejuice 2 Via Writer Seth Grahame-Smith!!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2012-05-17|accessdate=2012-08-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522005333/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55824|archivedate=May 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, "We talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [Michael's] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/165575-michael-keaton-meets-about-beetlejuice-2-seth-grahame-smith-offers-update|title=Michael Keaton Meets About Beetlejuice 2, Seth Grahame-Smith Offers Update|website=[[Shock Till You Drop]]|date=2012-02-11|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice {{sic}}, time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chitwood|first=Adam | url = http://collider.com/seth-grahame-smith-beetlejuice-sequel/153065/|title=Seth Grahame-Smith Gives Update on Beetlejuice Sequel; Says Film Will Be a True Sequel Set 26 or 27 Years After the Original|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=2012-03-17|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, [[Winona Ryder]] hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Andrew |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/18/exclusive-winona-ryder-on-beetlejuice-2-looks-like-it-s-happening-with-burton-keaton-and-ryder.html |title=Winona Ryder on‘Beetlejuice 2': 'Might Be Happening’With Burton, Keaton, and Ryder|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=2013-11-18|accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Burton stated, "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/392099-exclusive-tim-burton-thinks-theyre-closer-than-ever-to-beetlejuice-sequel|title=Exclusive: Tim Burton Thinks Beetlejuice 2 is Closer Than Ever|date=2014-12-14|website=[[ComingSoon.net]]|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming ''Beetlejuice 2'' by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/16/beetlejuice-2-something-wicked-gremlins-seth-grahame-smith/3|title='Beetlejuice' 2, 'Something Wicked,' 'Gremlins,' vampires galore: Seth Grahame-Smith's 2015 to-do list|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Beetlejuice 2' Is Really Happening, Says Winona Ryder|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/beetlejuice-2-sequel-winona-ryder-tim-burton-michael-keaton-1201567607/|accessdate=September 13, 2015|first=Mannie|last=Holmes|publisher=Variety|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Burton stated, "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it's not the ''Beetlejuice'' trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|url=http://collider.com/beetlejuice-2-update-tim-burton/|title=Beetlejuice 2: Tim Burton Gives Update on Sequel|publisher=Collider|date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mai, the Psychic Girl''===
Beginning in the late 1980s, [[New wave music|new wave]] rock band [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] attempted to make the Japanese manga ''[[Mai, the Psychic Girl]]'' into a musical, with interest from Burton&lt;ref name=Gall/&gt; and [[Carolco Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jay Carr | title = Batman to battle DeVito's Penguin | work = [[The Boston Globe]]| date = 1991-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; who purchased the [[film rights]] in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' for [[Touchstone Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeff Yang| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2009/08/06/apop080609.DTL| title = The Pokemon generation grows up | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date = 2009-08-06|accessdate = 2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out.&lt;ref name=Gall&gt;{{cite news | author = Joseph Galliano | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/classical/article6895801.ece| title = Striking Sparks with Bergman| work = [[The Sunday Times]]| date = 2009-10-30 | accessdate = 2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Ford Coppola]] later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] started on a different project with [[Kirk Wong]] attached to direct.&lt;ref name=SPE&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782459 | title =Wong to helm SPE's 'Psychic' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2000-06-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Claude Brodesser; Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117794526 | title =U opens its heart to Addario, Syracuse spec| work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2001-02-18 | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''[[The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman]]'', a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their ''Mai, the Psychic Girl'' produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a "second wind", vocalist [[Russell Mael]] explained. "The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day."&lt;ref name=Gall/&gt; On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tim-burton-mai-psychic-girl-ross-60405/|title=Tim Burton Directing 'Mai, the Psychic Girl'?|last=Miller|first=Ross|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stay Tuned''===
[[Morgan Creek Productions]] originally wanted Burton to direct ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'' because of his work on ''Beetlejuice'' and his art style, but Burton left the project to direct ''Batman Returns'', the sequel to his [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]], and was replaced by [[Peter Hyams]] while having some of the art styles paying tribute to Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/stay-tuned/55430/looking-back-at-stay-tuned|title=Looking back at Stay Tuned|last=Childs|first=Paul|website=denofgeek|accessdate=February 22, 2018|date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Singles'' television series===
After the 1992 film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'' was released, which had Burton in a rare credited acting role, [[Warner Bros. Television]] tried to turn the film into a [[television series]], but the project never materialized. The film's director [[Cameron Crowe]] claims that ''Singles'' inspired the television series ''[[Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, Jim. [http://www.jimdero.com/Bangs/on_the_set.htm "As Crowe flies"]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. September 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jurassic Park''===
Before [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' was published, Hollywood studios were highly interested in purchasing the [[film rights]]. This included Warner Bros. and Burton, Sony Pictures Entertainment and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] (1997). ''Steven Spielberg: A Biography''. Faber and Faber, 416–9. {{ISBN|0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights in May 1990 for [[Steven Spielberg]], resulting in the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 film adaptation]].&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;''Jurassic Park'' DVD production notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mary Reilly''===
Producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] acquired the film rights to ''[[Mary Reilly (novel)|Mary Reilly]]'' in 1989, and optioned them for Warner Bros. with [[Roman Polanski]] as director.&lt;ref name=mulls/&gt; When Guber became CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment later that year, he moved ''Mary Reilly'' to Sony's sister company, [[TriStar Pictures]], where Burton was approached to direct with [[Denise Di Novi]] to produce in 1991.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; [[Christopher Hampton]] was hired to write the screenplay, and Burton signed on as director in January 1993, after he approved over Hampton's rewrite.&lt;ref name=mulls&gt;{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR102864 | title = Fox mulls playing 'Pat' hand; TriStar woos Woo | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-01-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to start filming in January 1994, after he completed ''Ed Wood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR103729 | title = TriStar Pictures slate for 1993 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-02-04 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Burton dropped out in May 1993 over his anger against Guber for putting ''Ed Wood'' in turnaround. [[Stephen Frears]] was TriStar's first choice to replace Burton, and Di Novi was fired and replaced with [[Ned Tanen]].&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR106493 | title = Burton's off 'Reilly' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ended up becoming the critically and commercially unsuccessful ''[[Mary Reilly (film)|Mary Reilly]]'' in 1996, starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[John Malkovich]].

===''Catwoman''===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="After the traumas of ''Batman Returns'' she has amnesia, and she doesn't really remember why she has all these bullet holes in her body, so she goes to relax in Oasisburg.

[It's a] resort area in the middle of the desert. It's run by superheroes, and the movie has great fun at making fun at the whole male superhero mythos. Then they end up being not very good at all deep down, and she's got to go back to that whole Catwoman thing."|source=—Daniel Waters on his script for ''Catwoman''&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;}}

''Batman Returns'' would be the last film in the Warner Bros. [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]] that featured Burton and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor. With ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Joel Schumacher]], ''The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight: Reinventing a Hero'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; With Warner Bros. moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of her own spin-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-06-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-07-22 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-01-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "Turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman.

"Daniel Waters on Writing", ''Film Review'', pp. 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Tim Egan | title = Michelle Pfeiffer, Sensuous to Sensible | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by [[Ashley Judd]].

During the early development of the cancelled ''Catwoman'' spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the ''Batman'' film series that began with ''Batman'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizGvUlAybY|title=Tim Burton's Biography &amp; The Directors Batman Segments|first=|last=Kamdan|date=21 June 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Monkees]] lead drummer [[Micky Dolenz]] was attached to star as the [[Riddler]], the film's main antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/local_news/micky-dolenz-embraces-his-monkees-past/article_bd16fc13-2b88-5bb7-8f05-99f9c1796981.html|title=Micky Dolenz embraces his Monkees past|first=Thom Jennings|last=ngedit@niagara-gazette.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Harvey Dent's transformation into [[Two-Face]] was supposed to occur in the film, with [[Billy Dee Williams]] reprising his role as Dent from the first film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/02/billy-dee-williams-talks-two-face-did-not-get-paid-for-batman-forever/|title=Billy Dee Williams Talks Two-Face, Did Not Get Paid For Batman Forever|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after turning down the offer to appear in ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-faces.livejournal.com/85767.html|title=Stories That Never Were: the Harvey Dent we DIDN'T see in Tim Burton's "Batman" movies|first=2012-11-14 04:24:00 About_faces About_faces 2012-11-14 04:24:00|last=About_faceswrote|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these, Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to return as [[Catwoman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/catwoman/248479/whatever-happened-to-the-tim-burton-catwoman-movie|title=Whatever Happened to the Tim Burton Catwoman Movie?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marlon Wayans]] was attached to star as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/marlon-wayans%2C13500/ |title=Marlon Wayans - - A.V.

===''Cabin Boy''===
In 1993, Burton was set to direct ''[[Cabin Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/04/26/director-of-cabin-boy-explains-where-things-went-south/|title=Director of Cabin Boy Explains Where Things Went South|last=Getlen|first=Larry|publisher=NYPost|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left to direct ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. [[Adam Resnick]] eventually directed the 1994 film, with Burton in a producer role.

===''Geek Love''===
Burton bought the rights to ''[[Geek Love]]'' by [[Katherine Dunn]] in the 1990s. The story, about a traveling circus that uses chemicals to create genuine freaks, seemed perfect for Burton, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview with Dunn, she stated, "He's got the rights. That's half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he'd do. It's a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/2009/6/10/tim-burton-projects-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen.html|title=TIM BURTON projects that NEVER MADE it to the screen|last=Reyes|first=Eli|website=geektyrant|accessdate=July 18, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dinosaurs Attack!''===
Around 1995, writer Jonathan Gems wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of ''[[Dinosaurs Attack!]]'', with Burton as director. However, both Burton and Gems came to the conclusion that the project was too similar to ''Jurassic Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5963344/these-terrifying-dinosaurs-attack-trading-cards-from-the-1980s-traumatized-an-entire-generation|title=These terrifying Dinosaurs Attack! trading cards from the 1980s traumatized an entire generation|first=George|last=Dvorsky|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Toots and the Upside Down House''===
In 1996, when Burton was the CEO and founder of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' stop-motion studio division [[Skellington Productions]], he was going to produce the studio's planned third film, ''Toots and the Upside Down House'', that was based on the book by [[Carol Hughes (author)|Carol Hughes]] where a young girl still grieving over the death of her mother goes to a fantasy world inside her home when her dad still won't pay attention to her, where goblins, fairies and sprites live while helping the fairies battle an evil [[Jack Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='The Advanced Art of Stop-Motion Animation': History of Stop-Motion Feature Films: Part 2 | url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/advanced-art-stop-motion-animation-history-stop-motion-feature-films-part-2 | last=Priebe | first=Ken | publisher=''[[Animation World Network]]'' | quote="The relationship between Disney’s company Miramax and Henry Selick also became strained, as plans for another feature called ''Toots and the Upside Down House'' were abandoned. | accessdate=January 4, 2015 | date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton was attached to produce it, while [[Henry Selick]] was set to direct it (marking the third collaboration between Selick and Burton), with the screenplay written by [[Steven Soderbergh]] and co-produced by Disney's film partner at the time [[Miramax]], which would have made it the first original animated film made by the company.

Burton gave art director Sylvain Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside.

''Tim Burton's Lost in Oz'' would be a television series based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[List of Oz books|The Wizard of Oz]]'' book series. Burton would be its executive producer.

===''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''===
{{More|Ripley's Believe It or Not!#Planned film}}
During the mid-2000s, Burton was scheduled to direct a film based on the famous ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' franchise, with [[Jim Carrey]] portraying [[Robert Ripley]] and a script by ''Ed Wood'' scribes [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]]; the film ran over budget however, and was shelved by [[Paramount Pictures]]. Burton moved on to direct ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. On January 12, 2011, it was reported that Paramount had revived development of the film with screenwriter [[Eric Roth]], with Carrey still attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/01/paramount-reviving-ripleys-believe-it-or-not-with-eric-roth-96116/|title=Paramount Reviving 'Ripley's Believe It Or Not' With Eric Roth|first=Mike Fleming|last=Jr|date=13 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I was always very protective of ''Nightmare'' not to do sequels or things of that kind," Burton explained. "You know, 'Jack visits [[Thanksgiving]] world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies/|title=News - Entertainment, Music, Movies, Celebrity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Burton, [[Jim Steinman]], and [[David Ives]] had worked on a theatre production called ''Batman: The Musical''. Steinman has revealed five songs from the musical. The first is the opening theme for "Gotham City" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo "The Graveyard Shift"; followed by "The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)", "The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)", "We're Still The Children We Once Were" (the climactic sequence) and "In The Land Of The Pig The Butcher Is King", sung by the corrupt blood-suckers ruling Gotham, covered on the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose]]''. After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the ''Batman: The Musical'' memorial site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071124212821/http://www.freewebs.com/batman_themusical/ Dark Knight of the Soul]&lt;/ref&gt;

And I think we could continue the journey from where we left off and see how these creatures are existing in a world in which the natural environment is coming back and perhaps even threatening them in some way. Do they make the decision to not affect it, or do they try to affect it in some way? And do they still try to hold on to that humanity within them or do they recognize themselves at being machines too and go off on a different trajectory?

It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that.

===''Deep''===
On June 11, 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with [[Valve Corporation]] to create his next animated feature film, ''Deep''. Like ''9'', the film will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). ''Deep'' would of been another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/shane-acker-valve-deep-movie-sandy-178699/|title=’9′ Director Teaming With Valve for Post-Apocalyptic Animated Film, 'Deep'|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been no further announcements. However, despite the silence from Acker, in January 2017, the Facebook profile of the character "the Scientist" was updated with a rather cryptic message.

[[File:The Ride of the Valkyrs.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Ride of the Valkyrs'' (1909) by [[ John Charles Dollman]]]]

In [[Norse mythology]], a '''valkyrie''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|l|ˈ|k|ɪər|i|,_|-|ˈ|k|aɪ|r|i|,_|v|ɑː|l|-|,_|ˈ|v|æ|l|k|ər|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/valkyrie "Valkyrie"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|valkyrja}} "chooser of the slain") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife field {{lang|non|[[Fólkvangr]]}}), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, [[Valhalla]], ruled over by the god [[Odin]]. There, the deceased warriors become {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}} ([[Old Norse]] "single (or once) fighters"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36LINDOW104&gt;Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).&lt;/ref&gt;). When the {{lang|non|einherjar}} are not preparing for the events of [[Ragnarök]], the valkyries bear them [[mead]]. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by [[raven]]s and sometimes connected to [[swan]]s or [[horse]]s.

Valkyries are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the {{lang|non|[[Heimskringla]]}} (both by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) and the {{lang|non|[[Njáls saga]]}} (one of the [[Sagas of Icelanders]]), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of [[skald]]s, in a 14th-century [[magical formula|charm]], and in various [[runic inscriptions]].

The [[Old English]] [[cognate]] terms {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagans]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the [[Norns]], and the {{lang|non|[[dís]]ir}}, all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.

==Etymology==
The word ''valkyrie'' derives from [[Old Norse]] ''{{linktext|valkyrja|lang=non}}'' (plural {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}), which is composed of two words: the noun ''{{linktext|valr|lang=non}}'' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ''{{linktext|kjósa|lang=non}}'' (meaning "to choose"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}} is cognate to [[Old English]] ''{{linktext|wælcyrge|lang=ang}}''.&lt;ref name="BYOCK142-143"&gt;Byock (2005:142–143).&lt;/ref&gt; From the Old English and Old Norse forms, [[philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]] reconstructs the [[Proto-Germanic]] form {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/walakuzjǭ|wala-kuzjōn]]}}.&lt;ref name="OREL-442"&gt;Orel (2003:442).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the [[#Old English attestations|Old English attestations]] section below.

Other terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include {{lang|non|óskmey}} ("wish maid"), appearing in the poem {{lang|non|[[Oddrúnargrátr]]}} and  {{lang|non|Óðins [[wikt:mey|meyjar]]}} ("[[Odin]]'s maids"), appearing in the {{lang|non|[[Nafnaþulur]]}}. {{lang|non|Óskmey}} may be related to the [[List of names of Odin|Odinic name {{lang|non|Óski|nocat=y}}]] (roughly meaning "wish fulfiller"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.&lt;ref name="SIMEK254+349"&gt;Simek (2007:254 and 349).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse attestations==

===''Poetic Edda''===
Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' and ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''.

====''Völuspá'' and ''Grímnismál''====
[[File:Hild, Thrud and Hløkk by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The valkyries Hildr, Þrúðr and Hlökk bearing ale in Valhalla (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
In stanza 30 of the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] (a travelling [[seeress]] in Norse society) tells Odin that "she saw" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to "the realm of the gods". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: [[Skuld]] (Old Norse, possibly "debt" or "future") who "bore a shield", [[Skögul]] ("shaker"), [[Gunnr]] ("war"), [[Hildr]] ("battle"), [[Göndul]] ("[[wand]]-wielder") and [[Geirskögul]] ("Spear-Skögul"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the "ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth".&lt;ref name="DRONKE15ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Dronke (1997:15). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnar]] that he wishes that the valkyries [[Hrist]] ("shaker") and [[Mist (valkyrie)|Mist]] ("cloud") would "bear him a [drinking] [[drinking horn|horn]]", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says "bear [[ale]] to the [[einherjar]]"; [[Skeggjöld]] ("axe-age"), Skögul, Hildr, [[Þrúðr]] ("power"), [[Hlökk]] ("noise", or "battle"), [[Herfjötur]] ("host-fetter"), [[Göll]] ("tumult"), [[Geirahöð]] ("spear-fight"), [[Randgríð]] ("shield-truce"), [[Ráðgríð]] ("council-truce") and [[Reginleif]] ("power-truce").&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON57ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Larrington (1999:57). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Völundarkviða''====
[[File:Walkyrien by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Walkyrien'' (c. 1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]
A prose introduction in the poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]'' relates that the brothers [[Slagfiðr]], [[Agilaz|Egil]] and [[Wayland Smith|Völund]] dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir ("wolf dales"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár ("wolf lake"), and "near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named [[Hlaðguðr svanhvít]] ("swan-white") and [[Hervör alvitr]] (possibly meaning "all-wise" or "strange creature"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD83"&gt;Orchard (1997:83).&lt;/ref&gt;); the third, daughter of [[Kjárr]] of [[Valland]], is named [[Alruna|Ölrún]] (possibly meaning "[[beer]] [[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="SIMEK251"&gt;Simek (2007:251).&lt;/ref&gt;). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON102"&gt;Larrington (1999:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar''====
[[File:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1908) by [[Stephan Sinding]] located in [[Churchillparken|Churchill Park]] at [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a [[Tumulus#Scandinavia|burial mound]]. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as [[Sváfa|Sváva]], King Eylimi's daughter, who "often protected him in battles". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name ''[[Helge (name)|Helgi]]'' (meaning "the [[hallow|holy]] one"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD81"&gt;Orchard (1997:81).&lt;/ref&gt;). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as "bright-face lady", and asks her what gift he will receive with the [[Germanic name|name]] she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON125"&gt;Larrington (1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; Further into the poem, Atli [[flyting|flytes]] with the female [[jötunn]] [[Hrímgerðr]]. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[[Numbers in Germanic paganism|Three times nine girls]], but one girl rode ahead,
:white-skinned under her helmet;
:the horses were trembling, from their manes
:dew fell into the deep valleys,
:hail in the high woods;
:good fortune comes to men from there;
:all that I saw was hateful to me.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON128"&gt;Larrington (1999:128).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva "was a valkyrie just as before".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON129"&gt;Larrington (1999:129).&lt;/ref&gt; The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva "are said to be reincarnated".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON130-131"&gt;Larrington (1999:130–131).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I''====
[[File:Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigrún by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and Sigrún (1919) by [[Robert Engels]]]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', the hero [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the [[fell]], and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Then light shone from Logafell,
:and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning;
:wearing helmets at Himingvani [came the valkyries].
:Their byrnies were drenched in blood;
:and rays shone from their spears.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116"&gt;Larrington (1999:116).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as "southern goddesses") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie [[Sigrún]] ("victory-[[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"&gt;Orchard (1997:194).&lt;/ref&gt;), informs him from her horse that her father [[Högni]] has betrothed her to [[Höðbroddr]], the son of king [[Granmar]] of the [[Nibelung|Hniflung]] clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116-117"&gt;Larrington (1999:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the poem, the hero [[Sinfjötli]] [[flyting|flyts]] with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON119"&gt;Larrington (1999:119).&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the poem, the phrase "the valkyrie's airy sea" is used for "[[mist]]".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON120"&gt;Larrington (1999:120).&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as "the [[troll]]-woman's mount") consume corpses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Helmeted valkyries came down from the sky
:—the noise of spears grew loud—they protected the prince;
:then said Sigrun—the wound-giving valkyries flew,
:the [[troll]]-woman's mount was feasting on the fodder of ravens:&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON121"&gt;Larrington (1999:121).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON122"&gt;Larrington (1999:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana II''====
[[File:Helgi und Sigrun by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Helgi und Sigrun'' (1901) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]
At the beginning of the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'', a prose narrative says that King [[Sigmund]] (son of [[Völsung]]) and his wife [[Borghild]] (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier ''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar'').&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON132"&gt;Larrington (1999:132).&lt;/ref&gt; After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is "a valkyrie and rode through air and sea", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133"&gt;Larrington (1999:133).&lt;/ref&gt; In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase "fed the [[goose|gosling]] of Gunn's sisters". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are [[raven]]s, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133+281"&gt;Larrington (1999:133 and 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

After stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON135"&gt;Larrington (1999:135).&lt;/ref&gt; Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that "there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated" and that "Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of [[Halfdan]]; the valkyrie [[Kára]]. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work ''[[Káruljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON141"&gt;Larrington (1999:141).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sigrdrífumál''====
[[File:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The valkyrie [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''. Illustration (1911) by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', the hero [[Sigurd]] rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards "the land of the [[Franks]]". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, "as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a ''skjaldborg'' with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the ''skjaldborg'', and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's [[corslet]] is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.&lt;ref name="THORPE180"&gt;Thorpe (1907:180).&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a [[drinking horn|horn]] of [[mead]] to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen [[prayer]] in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named [[Sigrdrífa]] and that she is a valkyrie.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON166-167"&gt;Larrington (1999:166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had "brought down" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again "fight victoriously in battle", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing [[runic alphabet|runes]], mystic wisdom, and prophecy.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON167"&gt;Larrington (1999:167).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[File:Valkyrie (1834-1835) by H. W. Bissen.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1835) by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]]]
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] informs [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says "there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups." Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem ''Grímnismál'' that contains a list of valkyries. High says "these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory". High adds that [[Gunnr]] ("war"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"/&gt;), [[Róta]], and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as "the youngest [[norns|norn]]"—"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle".&lt;ref name="BYOCK44-45"&gt;Byock (2005:44–45).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife [[Frigg]] arrived at the funeral of their slain son [[Baldr]], with them came the valkyries and also [[Hugin and Munin|Odin's ravens]].&lt;ref name="BYOCK67"&gt;Byock (2005:67).&lt;/ref&gt;

References to valkyries appear throughout the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work ''[[Húsdrápa]]'' by the 10th century skald [[Úlfr Uggason]]. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:There I perceive valkyries and ravens,
:accompanying the wise victory-tree [Odin]
:to the drink of the holy offering [Baldr's funeral feast]
:Within have appeared these motifs.&lt;ref name="FAULKES68"&gt;Faulkes (1995:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' is provided (see the ''Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What sort of dream is that, Odin?
:I dreamed I rose up before dawn
:to clear up Val-hall for slain people.
:I aroused the Einheriar,
:bade them get up to strew the benches,
:clean the beer-cups,
:the valkyries to serve wine
:for the arrival of a prince.&lt;ref name="FAULKES69"&gt;Faulkes (1995:69).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including "[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or ''dísir''".&lt;ref name="FAULKES94"&gt;Faulkes (1995:94).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 41, while the hero [[Sigurd]] is riding his horse [[Grani]], he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]]. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and "she is known as [[Brynhildr]], and was a valkyrie".&lt;ref name="FAULKES102"&gt;Faulkes (1995:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 48, poetic terms for "battle" include "weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise", followed by examples of compositions by various [[skald]]s that have used the name of valkyries in said manner ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]] uses "Skögul's din" for "battlefield", [[Bersi Skáldtorfuson]] uses "Gunnr's fire" for "sword" and "Hlökk's snow" for "battle", [[Einarr Skúlason]] uses "Hildr's sail" for "shield" and "Göndul's crushing wind" for "battle" and [[Einarr Helgason|Einarr skálaglamm]] uses "Göndul's din"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term "death-maidens"—Old Norse ''valmeyjar''—instead of "valkyries" is used here), with further examples.&lt;ref name="FAULKES117-119"&gt;Faulkes (1995:117–119).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 57, within a list of names of [[ásynjur]] (and after alternate names for the goddess [[Freyja]] are provided), a further section contains a list of "Odin's maids"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, [[Eir]], Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that "they are called norns who shape necessity".&lt;ref name="FAULKES157"&gt;Faulkes (1995:157).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manuscripts of the feature ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of ''Skáldskaparmál'' contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the "valkyries of [[List of names of Odin|Viðrir]]"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.&lt;ref name="JÓNSSON678"&gt;Jónsson (1973:678).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hrafnsmál''===
[[File:Valkyrie and raven.jpg|thumb|A valkyrie speaks with a raven in a wood-engraving by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]] after [[Frederick Sandys]], 1862]]
The fragmentary skaldic poem ''[[Hrafnsmál]]'' (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald [[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of [[Harald I of Norway]]. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a "high-minded", "golden-haired" and "white-armed" maiden speaking with a "glossy-beaked raven". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Wise thought her the valkyrie; were welcome never
:men to the bright-eyed one, her who the birds' speech knew well.
: Greeted the light-lashed maiden, the lily-throated woman,
:The [[ymir|hymir]]'s-skull-cleaver as on cliff he was perching.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"How is it, ye ravens—whence are ye come now
:with beaks all gory, at break of morning?
:Carrion-reek ye carry, and your claws are bloody.
:Were ye near, at night-time, where ye knew of corpses?"&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54"&gt;Hollander (1980:54).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54-57"&gt;Hollander (1980:54–57).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Njáls saga''===
[[File:Henry De Groux001.jpg|thumb|''Ride of the Valkyries'' (around 1890) by [[Henry De Groux]]]]
In chapter 157 of ''[[Njáls saga]]'', a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on [[Good Friday]] in [[Caithness]]. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular [[loom]]; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]], a sword is the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], and the [[reel]]s are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'', which Dörruð memorizes.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER66"&gt;Hollander (1980:66).&lt;/ref&gt;

The song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] (fought outside [[Dublin]] in 1014 [[Common Era|CE]]). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, [[Hjörþrimul]], [[Sanngriðr]], [[Svipul]], [[Guðr]] and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Now awful it is to be without,
:as blood-red rack races overhead;
:is the welkin gory with warriors' blood
:as we valkyries war-songs chanted.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER68"&gt;Hollander (1980:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the end of the poem, the valkyries sing "start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!"&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER68/&gt; The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER66/&gt;

===''Heimskringla''===
[[File:The Valkyrie's Vigil.jpg|thumb|''The Valkyrie's Vigil'' (1906) by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
At the end of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' saga ''[[Hákonar saga góða]]'', the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]] is presented. The saga relates that king [[Haakon I of Norway]] died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North [[Hordaland]]. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla". The poem ''Hákonarmál'' is then provided.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER124-125"&gt;Hollander (2007:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hákonarmál'', Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to "choose among the kings' kinsmen" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the [[kenning]] "Skögul's-stormblast" for "battle". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that "groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads". Haakon hears "what the valkyries said", and the valkyries are described as sitting "high-hearted on horseback", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER125"&gt;Hollander (2007:125).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Hákon said:''
:"Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?"
:''Skogul said:''
:"'Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled."&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126"&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the "green homes of the godheads" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126-127"&gt;Hollander (2007:126–127).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fagrskinna''===
[[File:Heimdallr and valkyries by Frølich.jpg|thumb|An illustration of valkyries encountering the god [[Heimdallr]] as they carry a dead man to Valhalla (1906) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
[[File:Walhall by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Valhalla'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eiríksmál]]''. It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''Óðinn''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'What kind of a dream is it,' said Óðinn,
:in which just before daybreak,
:I thought I cleared Valhǫll,
:for coming of slain men?
:I waked the Einherjar,
:bade valkyries rise up,
:to strew the bench,
:and scour the beakers,

:wine to carry,
:as for a king's coming,
:here to me I expect
:heroes' coming from the world,
:certain great ones,
:so glad is my heart.&lt;ref name="FINLAY58"&gt;Finlay (2004:58).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The god [[Bragi]] asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.&lt;ref name="FINLAY59"&gt;Finlay (2004:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft trial]] held in 1324 in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], records a spell used by the accused [[Ragnhild Tregagás]] to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie [[Göndul]] being "sent out":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:I send out from me the spirits of (the valkyrie) Gondul.
:May the first bite you in the back.
:May the second bite you in the breast.
:May the third turn hate and envy upon you.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:37).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Old English attestations==
[[File:Sermo Lupi.jpg|thumb|A page from {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}]]
The Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}, written by [[Wulfstan II]], {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} is used, and considered to appear as word for a human "sorceress".&lt;ref name="NORTH106"&gt;North (1997:106).&lt;/ref&gt; An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's {{lang|la|De laudis virginitatis}} (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] {{lang|la|ueneris}} with {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} (with {{lang|ang|gydene}} meaning "goddess"). {{lang|ang|Wælcyrge}} is used to translate the names of the [[Classical mythology|classical]] [[Erinyes|furies]] in two manuscripts ([[Cotton Cleopatra]] A. iii, and the older ''Corpus Glossary''). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} is also used to gloss the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}} (meaning "dark one choosing the slain"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).&lt;ref name="NORTH106"/&gt;

==Archaeological record==

===Female figures and cup and horn-bearers===
[[File:Valkyrie on horse and giving valkyrie.jpg|thumb|Viking Age jewellery thought to depict valkyries. On the left of the photograph is a female mounted on horseback with a 'winged' cavalry spear clamped under her leg and a sword in her hand. The mounted female is being greeted by another female figure who is carrying a shield. On the right of the photograph is one of numerous female silver figures usually described in museums and books as valkyries (right)]]
[[Viking Age]] stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing [[drinking horn]]s, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir.&lt;ref name="SILVERFIGURES"&gt;Orchard (1997:172) and Lindow (2001:96).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because "they were thought to have protective powers".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt;

The [[Tjängvide image stone]] from the Baltic island of [[Gotland]], Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla.&lt;ref name="LINDOW276"&gt;Lindow (2001:276).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century [[runestone]] [[Sigurd stones#U 1163|U 1163]] features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.&lt;ref name="WESSEN621"&gt;Wessén &amp; Jansson (1953–58:621).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in [[Hårby]], [[Denmark]] by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".&lt;ref name="KENNEDY-2013"&gt;Kennedy (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runic inscriptions===
[[File:Rökstenen.jpg|thumb|The [[Rök Runestone]]]]
Specific valkyries are mentioned on two [[runestones]]; the early 9th century [[Rök Runestone]] in [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]], and the 10th-century [[Karlevi Runestone]] on the island of [[Öland]], [[Sweden]], which mentions the valkyrie [[Þrúðr]].&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt; On the Rök Runestone, a [[kenning]] is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:That we tell the twelfth, where the horse of the Valkyrie [literally "the horse of [[Gunnr]]"] sees food on the battlefield, where twenty kings are lying.&lt;ref name="ANDRÉN11"&gt;Andrén (2006:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], is the "valkyrie stick" from the late 14th century. The stick features a [[Runic alphabet|runic inscription]] intended as a charm. The inscription says that "I cut cure-runes", and also "help-runes", once against [[elf|elves]], twice against [[trolls]], thrice against [[jötunn|thurs]] and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Against the harmful ''skag''-valkyrie,
:so that she never shall, though she never would –
:evil woman! – injure (?) your life.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-35"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–35).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by "I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and ''jöluns'' wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself." According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–37).&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Sigrdrífumál'', where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term ''skag'' is unclear, but a cognate exists in ''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I'' where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a "''skass''-valkyrie". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like "supernatural sending", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also "sent forth".&lt;ref name=MACLEOD34-37/&gt;

==Valkyrie names==
{{main|List of valkyrie names}}
The Old Norse poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'' and the ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as ''[[Sigrún]]'' (who is attested in the poems ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'' and ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]''). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON96"&gt;Davidson (1988:96).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of [[skalds]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON+SIMEK"&gt;Examples include Davidson (1988:96–97) and Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name ''[[Herja]]'' has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess ''[[Hariasa]]'', who is attested from a stone from 187 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK143AND131"&gt;Simek (2007:143). For Hariasa, Simek (2007:131).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Herfjötur]]'' has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters.&lt;ref name="SIMEK142"&gt;Simek (2007:142).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Svipul]]'' may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over [[wyrd|wyrd or ørlog]]—a [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] concept of [[Destiny|fate]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK308"&gt;Simek (2007:308).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and Old English charms===
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Saxon [[tumulus|burial mound]] at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]]]
Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the [[Egypt]]ian army (glossed as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}}) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} in {{lang|la|De laudibus virginitatis}} may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}}, but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the ''Corpus Glossary'' instances "appear to show an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] conception of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} that was independent of contemporary [[Scandinavia]]n influence".&lt;ref name=NORTH106/&gt;

Two [[Old English literature|Old English]] charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; {{lang|ang|[[Wið færstice]]}}, a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and ''[[For a Swarm of Bees]]'', a charm to keep [[honey bee]]s from [[swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]. In {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}}, a sudden pain is attributed to a small, "shrieking" spear thrown with supernatural strength ({{lang|ang|mægen}}) by "fierce" loudly flying "mighty women" ({{lang|ang|mihtigan wif}}) who have ridden over a burial mound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;They were loud, yes, loud,
when they rode over the (burial) mound;
they were fierce when they rode across the land.
Shield yourself now, you can survive this strife.
Out, little spear, if there is one here within.
It stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,
where those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.&lt;ref name="HALL1-2"&gt;Hall (2007:1–2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD257"&gt;Greenfield (1996:257).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard North says that "though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}."&lt;ref name="NORTH105"&gt;North (1997:105).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorizes that {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke "a prosaic stitch in the side".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON63"&gt;Davidson (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of ''For a Swarm of Bees'', the swarming bees are referred to as "victory-women" (Old English {{lang|ang|sigewif}}):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Settle down, victory-women,
never be wild and fly to the woods.
Be as mindful of my welfare,
as is each man of eating and of home.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD256"&gt;Greenfield (1996:256).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "victory women" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the "victorious sword" (the stinging) of the bees.&lt;ref name=GREENFIELD256/&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation, fetters, {{lang|non|dísir}}, {{lang|non|idisi}} and norns===
[[File:Idise by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Idise'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
[[File:The Dises by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''The Dises'' (1909) by [[Dorothy Hardy]]]]

One of the two [[Old High German]] [[Merseburg Incantations]] call upon female beings—''[[Idisi]]''—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,
some bound fetters, some hampered the army,
some untied fetters:
Escape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"&gt;Simek (2007:171).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Idisi'' mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that "these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name {{lang|non|[[Herfjötur]]}} (Old Norse "army-fetter").&lt;ref name=SIMEK171/&gt; Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} charm and theorises a similar role for them both.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSON63/&gt;

Simek says that the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] term ''Idisi'' ({{lang-osx|idis}}, {{lang-goh|itis}}, {{lang-ang|ides}}) refers to a "dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin {{lang|la|[[matres and Matrones|matrona]]}}" and that a link to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] term {{lang|non|dísir}} is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name [[Idistaviso|Idisiaviso]] (meaning "plain of the Idisi") where forces commanded by [[Arminius]] fought those commanded by [[Germanicus]] at the [[Battle of the Weser River]] in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name ''Idisiaviso'', the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"/&gt;

Regarding the {{lang|non|dísir}}, Simek states that Old Norse {{lang|non|dís}} appears commonly as simply a term for "woman", just as Old High German {{lang|goh|itis}}, Old Saxon {{lang|osx|idis}} and Old English {{lang|ang|ides}}, and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, "several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in {{lang|non|[[Guðrúnarkviða]]}} I 19 the valkyries are even called {{lang|non|Herjans dísir}} "Odin's {{lang|non|dísir}}". The {{lang|non|dísir}} are explicitly called dead women in {{lang|non|[[Atlamál]]}} 28 and a secondary belief that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were the souls of dead women (see {{lang|non|[[fylgja|fylgjur]]}}) also underlies the {{lang|non|[[landdísir]]}} of [[Scandinavian folklore|Icelandic folklore]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK61-62"&gt;Simek (2007:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt; Simek says that "as the function of the [[Matres and Matrones|matrons]] was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the {{lang|non|dísir}}, like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses."&lt;ref name=SIMEK61-62/&gt;

[[Jacob Grimm]] states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a {{lang|non|dís}} can be both norn and a valkyrie, "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ''ride'' to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".&lt;ref name="GRIMM421"&gt;Grimm (1882:421).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and development===
[[File:Die Nornen (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Norns'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]

Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as "demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred "when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise". Simek says that this original concept was "superseded by the [[Shieldmaiden|shield girls]]—Irish female warriors who lived on like the ''einherjar'' in Valhall." Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as "demons of death". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in [[Poetic Edda#Heroic lays|heroic poetry]], and during this transition were stripped of their "demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...]." Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of [[List of valkyrie names in Norse mythology|valkyrie names]] do not appear to be very old, and that the names "mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief."&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"/&gt;

MacLeod and Mees theorise that "the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the [[Norns]], the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...]."&lt;ref name="MACLEOD39"&gt;MacLeod (2006:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that, regarding valkyries, "evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the [[Völva|seeresses]], who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the [[Black Sea]]". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a "priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61"&gt;Davidson (1990:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson places emphasis on the fact that ''valkyrie'' literally means "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a "chooser of the slain" in his ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' sermon, which appears among "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to "all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions", and concludes as those "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." Davidson points out that [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s detailed account of a 10th-century [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] ship funeral on the [[Volga River]] features an "old [[Huns|Hunnish]] woman, massive and grim to look upon" (who Fadlan refers to as the "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that "it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god "chose" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." Davidson says that it appears that from "early times" the [[Germanic peoples]] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61-62"&gt;Davidson (1990:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freyja and Fólkvangr===
[[File:Freya by C. E. Doepler.jpg|thumb|left|''Freya'' (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]]]]
The goddess [[Freyja]] and her afterlife field [[Fólkvangr]], where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in ''Gylfaginning'' where it is said of Freyja "whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain", and interprets ''Fólkvangr'' as "the field of the Warriors". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is [[Sessrumnir]] (which she translates as "filled with many seats"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that "still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'."&lt;ref name="NÄSSTRÖM61"&gt;Näsström (1999:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that "in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar {{Sic}} and the dísir."&lt;ref name="DOBAT186"&gt;Dobat (2006:186).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern art==
[[File:Jugend-magazine-valkyrie-rheingold-advertisement-I.jpg|thumb|upright|A valkyrie examines a bottle of [[Söhnlein]]'s "Rheingold" [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|sekt]] in a 1901 [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] advertisement]]
Valkyries have been the subjects of various poems, works of art and musical works. In poetry, valkyries appear in "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} by H. Heine (appearing in ''Romanzero'', 1847), "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} (1864) by H. v. Linge, and "''Sköldmon''{{-"}} (appearing in ''Gömda Land'', 1904).&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"&gt;Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art depicting valkyries include ''Die Walküren'' (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, ''Reitende Walküre'' ([[fresco]]), previously located in [[Munich]] palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, ''Valkyrien'' and ''Valkyriens død'' (paintings, both from 1860), ''Walkürenritt'' ([[etching]], 1871) by A. Welti, ''Walkürenritt'' ([[woodcut]], 1871) by T. Pixis, ''Walkürenritt'' (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), ''Die Walkyren'' ([[charcoal]], 1880) and ''Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten'' (painting, 1882) and ''Walkyrenschlacht'' (oil painting, 1884) by K. Ehrenberg, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting, 1888, and etching, 1890) by A. Welti, ''Walküre'' (statue) by H. Günther, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting) by H. Hendrich, ''Walkürenritt'' (painting) by F. Leeke, ''Einherier'' (painting, from around 1900), by K. Dielitz, ''The Ride of the Valkyries'' (painting, from around 1900) by J. C. Dollman, ''Valkyrie'' (statue, 1910) and ''Walhalla-freeze'' (located in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]], 1886–87), ''Walkyrien'' (print, 1915) by A. Kolb, and ''Valkyrier'' (drawing, 1925) by E. Hansen.&lt;ref name="SIMEK349-350"&gt;Simek (2007:349–350).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28683">'''Vision Forum''' is an organisation that carries out research in contemporary art and organises events that transgresses the boundaries between [[performance art|performance]], exhibition, [[workshop]]s and [[education]]. It grew from a series of events organised by [[Curatorial Mutiny]] in collaboration with KSM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isak.liu.se/ksm KSM website (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt; at Campus [[Norrköping]], [[Linköpings Universitet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.se/?l=en University website]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sweden]] 2005-2007. Vision Forum took its present form in 2008. It does not have a physical location or a program, but responds to the needs of the group of artists, curators and researchers that are part of the network at any given moment. Its members are mostly based in [[Europe]] and have carried out projects all over the continent, in North America, Australia and Asia. In 2009, neuroscientist [https://stephenwhitmarsh.com Stephen Whitmarsh] joined the group, showing that the organisation can host members outside of the artistic community. A strategy that has been developed further in  subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Now 2012"&gt;Time Capsules and Conditions of Now, Edited by Fatos Ustek, David Roberts Art Foundation, London, UK and Vision Forum 2012, {{ISBN|978-91-978934-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshops and Public Presentations==
[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|right|Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

In 2008-09, Vision Forum organised two major projects. (Anti)Realism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/2008antirealism.html Documentation of workshop and exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; brought together young contemporary visual artists based in Sweden, China, Great Britain, the Netherlands and France.&lt;ref name="Youth, Youth p. 120-121"&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 120-121, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the project was a practical workshop that took place in [[Guangzhou]], China, in September 2008. The European participants developed collaborative projects with their Chinese peers that focused on [[time-based art]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;”The title and the [[conceptual framework]] of the workshop (Anti)Realism was created to look into the differences and similarities of how we look at [[reality]] (both as individuals and as members of different cultures) and how that can be used to further our understanding and appreciation of life. The project allowed the participants to both understand differences between European cultures, as well as how these differ from Chinese contemporary art and life.”&lt;ref&gt;(Anti)Realism, Numéro 1, D'Ailleurs, Cold Mountain, France {{ISBN|978-2-9518588-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The results of the workshop were presented to the public at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Art and a second were later developed into an exhibition which was shown at Verkstad in Sweden, Ècole Régional de Beaux Arts de Besaçon in France and at Adele C in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 87, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to (Anti)Realism Vision Forum created four workshops in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Documentation of workshop organised by Formazero]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zürich]],&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial workshop in Zürich organised by White Space and other local players.[http://www.visionforum.eu/zurich.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/amsterdam.html Utopia workshop in Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/stockholm.html The Stockholm syndrom organised by Good TV at Konsthögskolan Stockholm]&lt;/ref&gt; These involved a completely different group of artists and curators from (Anti)Realism and focused on [[architecture]], artistic production, [[curator|curation]] and [[presentation]] respectively.

==The Development of Nodes==
[[File:Dinu.li.low.jpg|thumb|right| Video stills of Dinu Li's performance on the Shenzhen Metro that was part of The Invisible Generation, November 2009.]]

In 2009-10, Vision Forum focused on four major projects or “[[wikt:node|node]]s”. They were each made up of a number of artists and curators who, like the Vision Forum workshops in 2008-09 met regularly. The nodes were held together by all doing research on [[time]] and [[temporality]] in different ways. “If you don’t want God, you’d better have a multiverse” was curated and developed by [[1:1 Projects]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Blog devoted to the project]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was focused on workshops in Rome, [[Skopje]] and [[Paris]]. At the last meeting, the participants reformulated themselves into “OuUnPo” (Workshop for Alternative Universes), inspired by French literary group [[Oulipo]]. The participants organised a public event at [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome|MACRO]] in Rome and at [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]] &lt;ref&gt;Yane Calovski, Obj'ct, Ed. Basak Senova, Ponder Pause Process (a situation), p. 90-97, Zorlu Center Art Collection, Istanbul, Turkey {{ISBN|978-605-63320-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spring 2010 under the new name. Ouunpo has since then carried out events in [[Porto]], [[Athens]], [[Belgrade]], [[Amsterdam]]-[[Nijmegen]], [[Stockholm]]-[[Norrköping]]&lt;ref&gt;Music for Works, Takahashi and Miliani, Jacopo Miliani - Do you Believe in Mirages, a+mbookstore edizioni, Milano, 2012. {{ISBN|9788887071429}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with art and science institutions like [[Deste Foundation]] and [[Max Planck Institute]]. Australian artist duo [[A Constructed World]] started “Speech and What Archive?” which continued its activities in 2010-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speecharchive.blogspot.com/ The project’s official blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The node focused on alternative forms of communication and organised events in Paris, [[Nice]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Melbourne]] working with art institutions like [[Villa Arson]] and [[California College of the Arts|CCA]]. Curator Claire Louise Staunton carried out research which later lead to the creation of the temporary gallery “Inheritance Shenzhen”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/archive/id=24421 Article in Artforum picks by Robin Peckham]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Chinese region of [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inheritanceprojects.org/inh-sz/ Documentation of the Gallery’s activities December 2009 – April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This project was developed in Milton Keynes in 2011 with a large exhibition, seminar and publication.&lt;ref name="mkgallery.org"&gt;http://www.mkgallery.org/education/projectspace/community_without_propinquity/&lt;/ref&gt; They then travelled to [[Chandigar]] and as an outcome of this research the node presented an exhibition about British architect [[Jane Drew]] and the artistic work that flourished around her at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in London in 2014.

==The Invisible Generation==
{{Main|The Invisible Generation|l1= The Invisible Generation}}

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|left| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]

The fourth major project realized in 2009-10 was [[The Invisible Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Invisible Generation, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No, project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take. In the introduction to the project in the catalogue Gerrie van Noord writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “The Invisible Generation is a collection of artistic interventions that spread virally across the continents of our globe. It used the artistic and curatorial network of Vision Forum as a platform to multiply and make its way into the perception of people in unexpected spaces of selected cities around the world. The project takes its starting point in performative traditions, but focuses on practices and events that cross over into other time-based activities such as sound, film, video, literature, theatre and workshops and draws inspiration from other related fields such as journalism, fashion and design, but also from those further removed like mathematics and physics”&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie van Noord, p.8 The Invisible Generation catalogue, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Redefining Communication==
Since September 2011 Vision Forum organizes two international workshops a year in [[Östergötland]] in Sweden. These bring together members of the different international nodes (in 2012 Vision Forum ran 10 nodes) and interact with local institutions and art organizations. This means that the research carried out in the individual nodes have started cross referencing and exchanging methodology between each other. Vision Forum, through its structure, develops modes of [[communication]] and knowledge production that make use of current technology. The nodes of the network also allow a deeper dialogue with their audiences that, in their turn, are inscribed into in numerous interconnected networks.&lt;ref name="OuUnPo 2013"&gt;OuUnPo[RTO], edited by Claudia Squitieri and Samon Takahashi, texts by OuUnPo, designed by Åbäke published by Dent-de-Leone and Vision Forum, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It has become increasingly clear that the network focuses on research about how art uses, retains, distributes and develops knowledge along with how this can be fed back into the everyday lives of art's audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Invisible Generation]], Gerrie van Noord, 2011, published by Curatorial Mutiny and Vision Forum, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties in with Vision Forum's founder Per Hüttner's work that can be exemplified by projects like [[I am a Curator]]”,&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

This idea of exchange is based on co-producing knowledge with the collaborating institutions and audiences, rather than a top down knowledge distribution. The strategy that they call "collapsing the global with the local" is currently being developed by the network in collaboration with [[Global Art and the Museum]] at [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalartmuseum.de/site/guest_author/323 OuUnPo and Globalisation on Global Art and the Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residency and Interdisciplinary Activities==
In 2011 Vision Forum started publishing books and catalogues regularly to document its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vfpublications.blogspot.de/ The Organisations website for publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also started to produce experimental films in a separate node called Vision Forum Film. Two films were in Production in 2012: "Effektivia" directed by [[Jesper Frilund]] and [[Marcus Fernstad]] and "The River" by Sino-Swedish director Ting Ting Yang (杨婷婷).&lt;ref&gt;Vision Forum Film, edited by Rudi Heinrichsen, translated by Yan Rong and designed by Erik Månsson. Texts by Rudi Heinrichsen, Per Hüttner, Yang Tingting, Jesper Frilund and Rebbecca Catching. published by Vision Forum, 2013. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-8-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Vision Forum opened an international residency program called "Norrköping Air.&lt;ref&gt;David Isaksson, Norrköpings Tidningar, p. B2-3, 20 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;" The program was initiated in collaboration with KSM at [[Linköpings universitet]], [[IASPIS]] and offers three artists the opportunity to work in parallel [[Sweden]] for 3 months during the Swedish summer months. The project focuses on experimental art in public spaces, drawing inspiration from the [[Invisible Generation]] and similar projects and was developed in close dialogue with the centenary of Norrköping Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://norrkopingair.blogspot.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Warrior of Capestrano''''' is a tall [[limestone]] statue of a [[Picentes|Picene]] warrior, dated to around the 6th century BC. The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of [[Capestrano]], along with a female statue in civilian attire, called ''Lady of Capestrano''.&lt;ref name="Basile"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.academia.edu/959298/The_Capestrano_Warrior_and_Related_Monuments_of_the_Seventh_to_Fifth_Centuries_B.C| title =The Capestrano Warrior and Related Monuments of the Seventh to Fifth Centuries B.C. |author=Joe Basile|website=Revue des archéologues et historiens d’art de Louvain|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|date=1993| accessdate =30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Warrior'' statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (''[[kardiophylax]]'') protecting his chest and back,&lt;ref name="Basile"/&gt; a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as ''mitra'' (a short apron covering the back).

A [[South Picene language|South Picene]] inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: "''Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í''" ("Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Investigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an [[Iron Age]] cemetery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">'''World Press Cartoon''' is an independent organization based in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Founded in 2005 the organization is known for holding one of the world's largest and most prestigious annual press cartoon contests. World Press Cartoon has also organized separate exhibitions under thematic criteria, as gender violence or environment protection. In 2017 World Press Cartoon had its 12th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/06/14/world-press-cartoon-awards-top-prize-to-iranian-artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017, the awards ceremony is held in the [[Caldas da Rainha]]. After the contest, the prizewinning cartoons are assembled into a traveling exhibition that was already presented in Spain, France, Belgium, Mozambique, Brazil, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Mexico, United Kingdom, China and India. A catalogue presenting all the prizewinning entries is published annually in English and Portuguese.

Another primary objective of the organization is to support professional cartoonists on a wide international scale, with a special focus in the [[freedom of the press]].

The '''Xagħra Stone Circle''' ({{lang-mt|Iċ-Ċirku tax-Xagħra}}), also known as the '''Xagħra Hypogeum''' or the '''Brochtorff Circle''', is a [[Neolithic]] funerary complex located in [[Xagħra]], [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. It consists of a series of underground caves which were used to bury the dead, and which were surrounded by a walled enclosure. It mainly dates back to around 3000 to 2400 BC, although the earliest tombs at the site date back to 4100 to 3800 BC. The caves collapsed sometime before 2000 BC, and the site was later used for domestic and agricultural purposes.

After being discovered in the late 18th century, the site was excavated in the 1820s before being reburied and forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1964, and major excavations took place between 1987 and 1994. It is the only prehistoric stone-enclosed [[hypogeum]] in Europe, and it is regarded as one of the most important archaeological sites in Malta along with the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]] and the [[Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni]]. Recent dating through AMS has added scores of new date estimates of the burials as part of the ERC funded FRAGSUS project and the ToTL project. The isotopic studies indicate changing dietary and climatic conditions and link with broader changes in the local environment.

==Etymology==
When first discovered in 1788, the site was simply described as an "ancient structure" without a name. After it was depicted in paintings by Charles Brochtorff in the 1820s, the site was commonly referred to as the ''Brochtorff Circle'', although it is not known who came up with this name.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grima|first1=Noel|title=The Xaghra Hypogeum|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-01-10/news/the-xaghra-hypogeum-268745/|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829011131/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-01-10/news/the-xaghra-hypogeum-268745|archivedate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site eventually became known as the ''Xagħra Stone Circle'' or the ''Gozo Stone Circle''. According to the archaeologist David Trump, these names are misnomers because 'Stone Circles' in northern Europe and the British Isles refer to a different type of Neolithic structure. In 2009, Trump coined the term ''Xagħra Circle'' as the name best describing the site.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

==Site==
The Xagħra Stone Circle originally consisted of a walled enclosure surrounding underground caves which were used as a necropolis. It has some similarities to the [[Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni]], a prehistoric funerary complex on the main island of Malta.&lt;ref name="philipcoppens"/&gt; However, Ħal-Saflieni is a man-made carved structure, while the Xagħra Stone Circle consists of natural caves which were adapted into a cemetery. Excavations at the site have shown that the bodies of the deceased were dismembered, and the different body parts were buried at separate places.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

The site was the burial ground of the same community which built the nearby [[Ġgantija]] temple, which is now well-preserved. Several other temples might have stood in the vicinity, including at [[Santa Verna]] (where a few megaliths which are probably the remains of an important temple were found) and Ta' Ġesù.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

The earliest tombs at the site date back to between 4100 and 3800 BC, during the [[Żebbuġ phase]] of Maltese prehistory. There is very little activity from 3800 to 3000 BC, and most of the site is believed to date back to 3000 to 2400 BC, during the [[Tarxien phase]]. The caves in which the complex was built were prone to collapse, and they weakened over time so megaliths were used in an attempt to stabilize the roof. The structure finally collapsed at some point before 2000 BC.&lt;ref name="bristol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brochtorff Circle, Gozo, Malta|url=http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~alan/Arch/INSITE/research/comvis/brocht.htm|website=[[University of Bristol]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812085910/http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~alan/Arch/INSITE/research/comvis/brocht.htm|archivedate=12 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bronze Age]], the site was probably used for non-funerary domestic purposes, and remains from the [[Tarxien Cemetery phase|Tarxien Cemetery]] and [[Borġ in-Nadur phase]]s were uncovered in the area.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; The land was subsequently used for agricultural purposes until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

==Discovery, excavations and recent history==
[[File:Aquarelle de Charles de Brochtorff de 1825.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Xagħra Stone Circle by Charles Brochtorff]]

The Xagħra Stone Circle was first recorded by Jean Houel in 1788. In the 1820s, Otto Bayer excavated part of the complex through a collapsed cave roof, and Charles Brochtorff painted several paintings showing the site during this excavation. The site was filled in by the late 1830s, and its exact location was lost over time.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; The two monumental pillars which formed the circle's entrance still stood in 1828,&lt;ref name="philipcoppens"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coppens|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Coppens (author)|title=From the otherworld to another world?|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/hypogeum.html|website=philipcoppens.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180142/http://www.philipcoppens.com/hypogeum.html|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were subsequently removed.&lt;ref name="bristol"/&gt;

The complex was rediscovered by the Gozitan researcher Joe Attard Tabone in 1964. It was excavated between 1987 and 1994 by a joint team from the [[University of Malta]], the Maltese Museums Department and the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Xaghra Circle: (Brochtorff Circle).|url=http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/maltaxaghra.htm|website=Ancient Wisdom   THe fieldwork was directed by Dr David Trump, Dr Caroline MAlone and Dr Simon Stoddart, assisted by Prof Anthony Bonanno. A succession of student and professional volunteers assisted (see 2009 Malone et al, Mortuary Practices in Prehistoric Malta),  Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405052726/http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/maltaxaghra.htm|archivedate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations revealed the remains of one of the largest funerary complexes in the Mediterranean, and led to a better understanding of the society who built Malta's megalithic temples. About 220,000 human bones belonging to between 450 and 800 individuals were uncovered during the excavations, along with some animal bones and a series of artifacts, including figurines and architectural fragments.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

[[File:Batons de chaman.jpg|thumb|left|Stone figurines found at the Xagħra Stone Circle, now displayed at the [[Ġgantija]] museum]]

The Xagħra Stone Circle is regarded as one of the most important archaeological sites in Malta. It is the only stone-enclosed [[hypogeum]] in Europe, and the only prehistoric necropolis in Malta which was properly excavated – no records were kept when the human remains and artifacts at Ħal-Saflieni were cleared in the early 20th century. Parts of the site remain unstudied, and efforts are being made to preserve the complex, since it is fragile and prone to collapse.&lt;ref name="independent2010-01-10"/&gt;

The site is on government-owned land, and it is managed by [[Heritage Malta]]. The remains have Class A protection, and they are listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name="nicpmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xagħra Stone Circle|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00026.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818135702/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00026.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2016|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is not accessible to the public.
