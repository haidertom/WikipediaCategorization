When a [[Silicon Valley]] [[Chinese American]] executive goes back to his homeland of China for the first time in 30 years, he and his family encounter many culture clashes between the lives that they lead in the United States and the lives of their relatives in China. The finale of the movie includes an exciting table tennis match involving the Chinese-American son played by [[Kelvin Han Yee]].

==Reception==
The film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 80% with a certified "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 5 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/great_wall/|title=A Great Wall (Beijing Story)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed film critic [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''Chicago-Sun Times'' awarded the film with 3 out of 4 stars and wrote of the film saying "A Great Wall is a human comedy about a Chinese-American family that goes to visit relatives in Peking, and within that simple premise are so many inspirations that the movie is interesting even when it's just looking at things." and went on to say "The chief pleasure of "A Great Wall" is its observation of the different attitudes toward the daily process of living in China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-great-wall-1986|title=A Great Wall, Roger Ebert Review|date=18 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antirom''' [[Artist collective|art collective]] was formed in 1994 as a "protest against ill-conceived [[point-and-click]] [[3D interface]]s grafted onto re-purposed old content - video, text, images, audio and so on - and repackaged as [[multimedia]]". Its initial and most notable project, the Antirom CD-ROM, was funded by [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and focussed on exploring [[interactivity]] in its own right, rather than being an interface to existing content such as video, audio and text. The group's process included producing many small interactive 'toys' that revolved around a single idea such as [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|sound mixing]], bouncing or [[scrolling]] elements. In the context of multimedia, at the time, this was a very different approach to the dominant "encyclopaedia" format such as [[Encarta]]. Antirom influenced several other designers such as [[Brendan Dawes]] who said of the group, "these guys changed things. Nothing was the same in the world of so called multimedia ever again. I remember seeing the amazing, different work for Levi's, which had a massive impact on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawes|first=Brendan|title=Brendan Dawes Amazon.com Author Profile|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NP8G6G91X364/ref=cm_blog_dp_pdp/t/002-8664612-6519228|date=2006-12-09|accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage in the development of the multimedia industry, most titles were lavishly produced and funded by large organisations hoping to create a breakthrough product that generated a lot of sales. The Antirom CD took what were at the time innovative [[interaction techniques]] such as using the mouse to control bizarre sounds and animations of random lines and colours and created experiences that confounded, entertained and confused. In his essay ''Cinema As A Cultural Interface'' (also a chapter in ''[[The Language of New Media]]''), new media theorist, [[Lev Manovich]], uses Antirom's work in [[HotWired]]'s now defunct [[RGB Gallery]] to describe "how cultural interfaces stretch the definition of a page while mixing together its different historical forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manovich|first=Lev|authorlink=Lev Manovich Polaine|url=http://www.manovich.net/TEXT/cinema-cultural.html|title=Cinema As A Cultural Interface|accessdate=2008-04-22|year=2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404163655/http://www.manovich.net/TEXT/cinema-cultural.html| archivedate= 4 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founders were Andy Cameron, Andy Allenson, Rob LeQuesne, Luke Pendrell, Sophie Pendrell, Andy Polaine, [[Nicolas Roope]], Tom Roope, and Joe Stephenson.  Anthony Rogers, [[:de:Joel Baumann|Joel Baumann]] and Jason Tame joined the group later.  Many of the members were students under Cameron's lectureship at the School of Media, Arts and Design at the [[University of Westminster]].  Tom Smith also introduced the team to new multimedia programming techniques in his role as visiting lecturer there.

Aside from continued experimental work and research, the [[collective]] produced commercial work for clients such as [[Science Museum (London)|The Science Museum]], the [[BBC]] and [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]]. Antirom had a flat non-hierarchical structure with all collective members having an equal say in how the collective was run. The group finally disbanded in 1999 and its members continue to work in other studios and [[academia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21239">An '''auteur''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|t|ɜːr}}; {{IPA-fr|otœʁ|lang}}, {{lit.}} '[[author]]') is an artist, such as a [[film director]], who applies a highly centralized and subjective control to many aspects of a collaborative creative work; in other words, a person equivalent to an author of a novel or a play.{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} The term is commonly referenced to [[filmmakers]] or directors with a recognizable style or thematic preoccupation.{{sfn|Min|Joo|Kwak|2003|p=85}}

Auteurism originated in the French [[film criticism]] of the late 1940s as a [[value system]]{{sfn|Caughie|2013|pp=22–34, 62–66}} that derives from the [[film criticism]] approach of [[André Bazin]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]]—dubbed '''auteur theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; by the American critic [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Auteur theory|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Sarris|authorlink=Andrew Sarris|coauthors=|date=Winter 1962–1963|title=Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962|journal=Film Culture|volume=27|issue=|pages=1–8|id=|url=https://dramaandfilm.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/06/Sarris-Notes-on-the-Auteur-Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was invented to distinguish [[French New Wave]] filmmakers from [[studio system|studio-system]] directors that were part of the [[Hollywood]] establishment,{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} and has since been applied to producers of [[popular music]] as well as to [[video games|video-game]] creators.

==Film==
{{see also|List of film auteurs}}

=== Origin ===
[[File:Truffaut-BeauSerge.jpg|thumb|Film director and critic [[François Truffaut]] in 1965]]

Even before the auteur theory was clearly defined, the director was considered to be the most important among the people working on a film. Early German film theorist [[Walter Julius Bloem]] credited this to film being an art for the masses, and the masses being accustomed to regard someone who gives the final product (in this case, the director) as an artist, and those who contribute before (i.e. screenwriters) as apprentices.{{sfn|Bloem|1924}} &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=James|date=May 2010|title=Everyone's a Critic: Film Criticism Through History and Into the Digital Age|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honors|journal=Senior Honors Theses|volume=|pages=32|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[James Agee]], one of the most famous film critics of the 1940s, said that "The best films are personal ones, made by forceful directors."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Around the same time, the French film critics [[André Bazin]] and [[Roger Leenhardt]] became advocates for the theory that it is the director that brings the film to life and uses the film to express their thoughts and feelings about the subject matter as well as a worldview as an auteur. They emphasised that an auteur can use lighting, camerawork, staging and editing to add to their vision.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|pp=381–383}}

===Development of theory===
The French magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' was founded in 1951 and quickly became a focal point for discussion on the role of directors in cinema. In [[François Truffaut]]'s 1954 essay "Une certaine tendance du cinéma français" ("A certain tendency in French cinema"), he criticized the prevailing "Cinema of Quality" trend in French cinema, saying that filmmakers were being unadventurous by adapting literary classics into unimaginative films. Truffaut said that these films treated the director as only a ''metteur en scene'', a "stager" who simply adds the performers and pictures to an already completed script.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|p=382}} Truffaut coined the phrase ''La politique des auteurs'' ("The policy of the authors") to describe his view, in which he expressed a clear preference for directors who operated with autonomy, vision and a signature style. These discussions were part of the beginning of the [[French New Wave]] in cinema.

From 1960, with his first self-directed film ''[[The Bellboy]]'', [[Jerry Lewis]] was one of the earliest Hollywood studio-system actor-turned-directors to be critiqued as an auteur. His attention to both the business and creative sides of production: writing, directing, lighting, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of the auteur theory. He earned consistent praise by French critics in both ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' and ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]''. His singular ''[[mis-en-scene]]'', and skill behind the camera, was aligned with [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Satyajit Ray]]. [[Jean-Luc Godard]] said, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films. He’s been able to do it because of his personal genius”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization and impact===
[[Andrew Sarris]] coined the phrase "auteur theory" to translate ''la politique des auteurs'' and is credited for popularizing it in the United States and English-speaking media. He first used the phrase in his 1962 essay ''Notes on the Auteur Theory'' in the journal ''[[Film Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began applying its methods to Hollywood films, and expanded his thoughts in his book ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (1968). The impact of Sarris' work was that critical and public attention on each film focused less on its stars and more on the overall product.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In the 1960s and the 1970s, the filmmaking industry was revitalized by a new generation of directors. Known as the [[New Hollywood]] era, these directors were given increased control over their projects.&lt;ref&gt;David A Cook, "Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844256-7,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Studios showed an increase willingness to let directors take risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase came to end in the 1980s, when high-profile financial failures like ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' prompted studios to reassert control.

=== Criticism ===
The auteur theory had detractors from the beginning. [[Pauline Kael]] was an early opponent and she debated it with Andrew Sarris in the pages of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and various film magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/movies/12powe.html A Survivor of Film Criticism’s Heroic Age]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/44957 Pauline and Me: Farewell, My Lovely]&lt;/ref&gt; Kael opposed privileging the director and instead argued that a film should be seen a collaborative process. In her 1971 essay ''[[Raising Kane]]'' (1971), on [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', she points out how the film made extensive use of the distinctive talents of co-writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kael, Pauline, "[[Raising Kane]]", ''The New Yorker'', February 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] and [[David Kipen]] have argued that writing is more important to a film's success than the directing.&lt;ref&gt;Kipen,  David (2006). ''The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History'', p.38. Melville House {{ISBN|0-9766583-3-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane Garrett. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930243.html?categoryid=1010&amp;cs=1 Book Review: The Schreiber Theory]." ''Variety'', April 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corliss-obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/business/media/richard-corliss-71-longtime-film-critic-for-time-dies.html|title = Richard Corliss, 71, Longtime Film Critic for Time, Dies|last = Weber|first = Bruce|date = April 24, 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = May 17, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 book, Kipen coined the term [[Schreiber theory]] to refer to the theory that the screenwriter is the principal author of a film.

Film historian [[Georges Sadoul]] pointed out that the main author of a film is not necessarily the director, but can be the main actor, screenwriter, producer, or even the author of the original story (in case of literary adaptations). Also, he argued that the film can only be seen as a work of collective and not as a work of a single person.{{sfn|Sadoul|1972}} Film historian [[Aljean Harmetz]], referring to the creative input of producers and studio executives in classical Hollywood, argues that the auteur theory "collapses against the reality of the studio system".&lt;ref&gt;Aljean Harmetz, ''Round up the Usual Suspects'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticize the auteur theory, and the practice of praising auteurs, for being male-dominated. Writing for ''[[IndieWire]]'' in 2013, Maria Giese noted that pantheons of auteur directors rarely included a single woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/12/auteur-directors-any-american-women-169108/|title=Auteur  Directors: Any American Women?|last=Giese|first=Maria|date=2013-12-09|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point to the broader lack of women directors; the under-representation of [[women in film]] has been called the [[celluloid ceiling]]. In 2016, just 7% of all directors for the top 250 grossing movies were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/women-filmmakers-2016-statistics-show-female-directors-declined-number-963729|title=Study: Female Filmmakers Lost Ground in 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to the lack of women in film schools, which has since changed. Now, Professor Martha Lauzen of [[San Diego State University]] says that women are represented in film schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/31/female-film-makers|title=Why are there so few female film-makers?|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-01-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
There are references in law,{{vague|reason=The law where?|date=August 2016}} where a directed film is treated as a work of art and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original [[copyright]] holder. Under [[European Union law]], the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.{{sfn|Kamina|2002|p=153}}

== Popular music ==
[[File:Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Record producer [[Phil Spector]] in 1964]]

The references of auteur theory are occasionally applied to musicians, musical performers and music producers. From the 1960s, [[Phil Spector]] is considered the first auteur among producers of popular music.{{sfn|Eisenberg|2005|p=103}}{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Author Matthew Bannister named him the first "star" producer.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] wrote: "Spector created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.".{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15-16}}

Another early [[pop music]] auteur was [[the Beach Boys]]' multi-tasking leader [[Brian Wilson]],{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} who himself was mentored by Spector.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} Before the [[progressive pop]] of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=217}} Wilson became the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as a discrete instrument]],{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} thus making the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on his influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Jason Guriel wrote that Wilson "paved the way for auteurs like [[Kanye West]] ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ... [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near."&lt;ref name="Guriel2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guriel|first1=Jason|title=How Pet Sounds Invented the Modern Pop Album|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/how-pet-sounds-invented-the-modern-pop-album/482940/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video games ==
{{See also|Art game|Video games as an art form}}

In broadening the use of the terms associated with auteur theory, it has also been applied to the audio-visual environment as encountered in video games. Japanese developer [[Hideo Kojima]] (''[[Metal Gear]]'' series) is considered to be the first auteur of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hideo Kojima - video gaming's first auteur - Screen Robot|url=http://screenrobot.com/hideo-kojima-video-gamings-first-auteur/|website=Screen Robot|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other auters include [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series), [[Fumito Ueda]] (''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', ''[[The Last Guardian]]''), [[Jon Van Caneghem]] (''[[Might and Magic]]'' series), [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] (''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-09-final-fantasy-xv-and-the-last-guardian-the-last-of-their-kind | title = Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian: The Last of their Kind | first = Rob | last = Fahey | date = 9 December 2016 | accessdate = 9 December 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ragnar Tørnquist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the creator of Dreamfall got back to his roots - Polygon|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/4/25/4261002/the-longest-journey-of-ragnar-tornquist|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

The '''Bikaner style of painting''' is a [[Art of Rajasthan|Rajasthani]] style of [[Indian painting]] developed in the city of [[Bikaner]]. It emerged in medieval India and was founded by Prince [[Rao Bika]] in 1488.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bikanerminiaturearts.com/art.asp|title = Miniature Art - A snapshot|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The subjects painted often originate from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]]. Elephant trunks are frequently featured. Jain, Buddhist, Mughal, Rajput, and Deccan miniatures have been found using the Bikaner style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raja [[Rai Singh]] was particularly influenced by Mughal art. Some notable examples of this school of art were painted during reigns of [[Rai Singh]], [[Karan Singh]] and [[Rao Anup Singh|Anup Singh]]. They painted scenes from the [[Ragmala]], [[Bhagavata Purana]], and [[Rasa lila]].

What distinguishes the Bikaner style of painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajuswami.com/about/|title=About Bikaner Miniature Painting Style Rajasthani Miniature Style|website=Raju Swami|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; from other Rajasthani styles of painting are finer lines and a more reserved range of colors than what are typically present in Mughal artwork. [[Shahjahan]] employed patrons of this school of art such as [[Karan Singh]]. [[Ali Raza (painter)|Ali Raza]] painted paintings of [[Lakshmi Narayana]] and a portrait of Karan Singh. Another famous painter was [[Rukn ud din Firuz|Rukh-ud-din]] who used [[Deccan]] art elements. Rukh-ud-din used the technique of painting fountains and court scenes using a nature-based background. Later Bikaneri art focused on [[Bikaner]]’s architecture such as [[havelis]] in the city. [[Bikaner]]i artists displayed their work outside royal courts giving businessmen and landlords the chance to appreciate this style of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://mahaveerswami.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/history-of-bikaner-style-of-painting-and-its-contemporary-contexts/|title = History of Bikaner Style of Painting and its Contemporary Contexts|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Swami|first = Mahaveer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Brooch of Lorn ''' or ''Braìste Lathurna'' in Gaelic, is a medieval "turreted" disk brooch that was supposedly taken from [[Robert the Bruce]] (Robert I of Scotland) at the [[Battle of Dalrigh]] in 1306.&lt;ref name="MacDougall, 110–112"&gt;MacDougall, 110–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brooch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_illustration.jsp?item_id=10960 |title=Brooch of Lorn |accessdate=13 April 2009 |quote=This brooch is said to have belonged to Robert the Bruce. After his defeat at the battle of Methven, in 1306, Robert the Bruce retreated towards the Argyll coast. At Dalrigh, near Tyndrum, he was ambushed by John Bacach, 5th chief of Clan MacDougall, with around 1,000 soldiers. The attack was revenge for the murder of John Comyn, a nephew of the MacDougall chief and rival for the throne. In the ensuing struggle Bruce was forced to leave his cloak and brooch in the grasp of one of his attackers. ... |publisher=Ambaile.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the brooch is today dated long after this period.  The brooch is centred on a large [[quartz]] [[charmstone]], and it is not implausible that this stone had belonged to the Bruce; the brooch  also acted as a [[reliquary]].&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 46, Gillies&lt;/ref&gt; The brooch is owned by the MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust.  It was rarely seen in public until it was loaned to an exhibition in the [[British Museum]] in London in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gillies"&gt;Gillies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and context==
The brooch is one of three West Highland 16th-century silver turreted brooches centred on charmstones, though the brooches are thought to be resettings of stones which already had reputations.  The others are the Lochbuy or Lochbuie Brooch in the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=63346&amp;partId=1 Lochbuie Brooch], [[British Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ugadale or Lossit Brooch, also still in private hands.  All three were exhibited together in the British Museum's exhibition ''[[Shakespeare: Staging the World]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Fotheringham, 43–46; [http://forargyll.com/2012/04/brooch-of-lorn-goes-south-to-british-museum-for-shakespeare-exhibition/ "Brooch of Lorn goes south to British Museum for Shakespeare exhibition"], 9 April 2012 (with the best photographs); Gillies&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months a replica made in recent years was exhibited in six local libraries in [[Argyll]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/ab/SAL/2012/08/24/invitation-to-visit-the-brooch-of-lorn-at-your-local-library/ Argyll Council]; Gillies&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver disc at the back of the brooch is about 4.5 inches across, and the brooch is secured by a hinged pin (a later replacement) and catch behind it. Underneath the central stone is an empty compartment (said in 1905 to contain fragments of human bone),&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, 111; Gillies&lt;/ref&gt; probably designed to hold a [[relic]]; the stone is set well above the base disc, and is surrounded by eight detached ''chatons'' or turrets, about 1.25 inches high, and each topped by a Scottish [[freshwater pearl]].  There is "a profusion of [[filigree]] work in the form of stellate ''appliqué'' ornaments and cabled borders".&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 46 (quoted); MacDougall, 111; Gillies&lt;/ref&gt; The style of decoration appears influenced by European workshops, and the brooch lacks the post-[[Insular art|Insular]] motifs seen in the Lochbuie Brooch,&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt; and other late medieval West Highland objects in various media.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 147, 185–191&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "turrets" as decoration was popular in late medieval jewellery, but usually in far less elaborate forms, with brooches having a number of small projecting turrets around a ring forming the brooch.

The dating of the Brooch of Lorn varies somewhat, though all contemporary specialists are clear that it is from well after Robert the Bruce's lifetime. The British Museum describes it as "dated on stylistic grounds to late 16th C but incorporating earlier rock crystal charmstones in which there was revived interest in the 16th C.", and dates its own Lochbuie Brooch, which it believes was by the same hand, to "1600 (circa)".&lt;ref&gt;British Museum, Lochbuie Brooch, as reference above.&lt;/ref&gt; David Caldwell, curator of the Scottish medieval collections at the [[National Museums of Scotland]], is quoted as saying, "It is a very important piece of west Highland art, but it dates from the mid 15th century, so cannot be Bruce’s. Maybe the original brooch fell to pieces and this one was substituted for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Display plan for clan Bruce relic |url=http://www.macdougall.org/brooch.htm |work=Macdougall.org |date= |accessdate=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Findlay in 1999 preferred the earlier part of the 16th century, and Catherine Gillies, curator for the clan, says, "The re-setting has been narrowed by style and historiography to roughly the third quarter of the 16th century", but still uses the description "medieval".&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, 111; Gillies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1306 the [[Battle of Dalrigh]] took place where Robert the Bruce of Scotland was ambushed by [[John of Argyll]], chief of the [[Clan MacDougall]]. The attack was revenge for the murder of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], a nephew of John of Argyll and rival for the throne of Scotland. According to tradition, the attackers tried to dismount Robert the Bruce but only pulled off his cloak and brooch.  The brooch was kept at [[Dunollie Castle]] until being moved to [[Gylen Castle]] on the island of [[Kerrera]] during the [[Covenanter Wars]]. The castle was captured and burned by [[David Leslie, Lord Newark]] in 1647 and the brooch was taken.&lt;ref name="MacDougall, 110–112"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brooch/&gt;

It was hidden until the early 19th century when it was found in a chest by Major Campbell of Bragleen after his return from fighting in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. A document confirmed that it had been taken from [[Gylen Castle]] by the Campbells, and it was viewed by the MacDougall chief before Major Campbell's death in 1819. It was returned to the MacDougall in 1824 by General Duncan Campbell of Lochnell. [[Queen Victoria]] viewed the brooch during a visit with the MacDougall clan chief in 1842, taking it in her hand and examining it closely.&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, 111–114; Gillies has a slightly different version of the rediscovery&lt;/ref&gt;

One rare appearance in public was when the MacDougal chief wore it when [[Elizabeth II]] visited [[Oban]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=brooch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Display plan for clan Bruce relic |url=http://www.macdougall.org/brooch.htm |quote=The royal jewel is said to have been torn from the Scottish king's cloak as he fled from defeat at the battle of Dalrigh, near Tyndrum, in 1306.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Scott==
The "Broach of Lorn" was the subject of sections XI-XIII of the second [[canto]] of ''[[The Lord of the Isles]]'', a poem by Sir [[Walter Scott]] (1815), although as he was writing at a point when no one had seen the brooch for over a century, and it was believed to be lost, his description was not very accurate, calling the brooch gold for example:&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Whence the broach of burning gold 
:That clasps the Chieftain's mantle-fold, 
:Wrought and chased with rare device, 
:Studded fair with gems of price,...&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lordofisles00scotrich ''The Lord of the Isles''], full text at the [[Internet Archive]]; Canto 2, start of section XI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10705">'''Budget albums''' (also known as '''drugstore records''' or, then, '''junk records''') were low-priced vinyl  LPs of [[pop music|popular]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music released during the 1950s to 1970s consisting either of previously released material (usually the releases from major labels featuring older performances of well-known performers) or material recorded especially for the line (often [[cover versions]] of popular songs made famous by name artists sung or performed on these albums by usually unidentified and unknown entertainers). Prices ranged from as low as 59 U.S. cents (minor label releases of the 1950s) to $2.98 (major label repackaging of older material in the 1970s). In the UK [[Pickwick Records]]' [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] record series, which operated between 1968 and 1985, was the most successful budget album range.

==Drugstore debut==
Discount stores (as well as Department stores) have had records produced by them by various record producing companies since the 1910s.  It was fashionable for a chain like McCrory's or Kress to have their own exclusive label.  Most of these records contained songs also available on many other 'exclusive' labels. (For example from the 1920s into the 1930s, Paramount produced the 'Broadway' label for Montgomery Ward, Cameo produced the 'Romeo' label for Kress, Columbia produced the 'Diva' label for W.T. Grant, and Plaza produced the 'Oriole' label for McCrory's, among many others.)

'''Drugstore records''' were called such as they were often sold in metal racks similar to the racks used for [[paperback]] books in [[Pharmacy|drugstores]] or [[Variety store|dimestores]] in the 1960s for prices from half to a quarter of regular [[LP album]]s. These records were markedly less expensive than major label recordings.

The initial "drugstore records" mostly comprised [[popular music]] played or sung by unknown orchestras or singers, or conversely, once famous singers or orchestras playing music or songs that were relatively unknown (popular singers' early and obscure recordings were often showcased as well). 

By the LP era, in some cases (notably the least expensive of the records) the record album would have only one [[cover version]] of a famous song or tune. Many of these albums had attractive [[album cover]] artwork (often picturing beautiful starlets such as [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Irish McCalla]], and the then-unknown [[Mary Tyler Moore]]). The album were often filled out with music in the [[public domain]] or obscure music never recorded by anyone else. Sometimes the "[[orchestra]]s" comprised very few musicians, were performed by background music companies, or were recorded outside the United States by orchestras credited under different names, such as ''[[101 Strings]]''.

Despite major record companies lowering their prices or starting their own budget labels, the budget album companies, such as Coronet who sold their LPs for 99 cents, remained popular.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|page=26|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugstore records originated with [[Pickwick International]], founded by [[Cy Leslie]]. Leslie's first business was a prerecorded [[greeting card]] service that turned into children's record label Voco Records in 1946. In 1950 Leslie founded [[Pickwick Records]] and by 1953 Pickwick entered the [[LP album|LP]] market providing lower priced records.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann, Frank Editor &amp; Ferstler, Howard Technical Editor ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound'' Routledge (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early producer of drugstore records was [[Enoch Light]], who started [[Waldorf Music Hall Records]] under the auspices of the [[F.W. Woolworth]] [[dime store]] chain. Unlike most drugstore record producers, Light was well regarded both  as a musician and for his technical recording knowledge; which he would make much use of later in establishing [[Command Records]].

Probably the best known and most prolific drugstore label was [[Crown Records]], an offshoot of [[Modern Records]], originally a jazz label owned by the Bihari brothers and operated from Los Angeles. From the mid-1950s to the early 80s, Crown turned out hundreds of cheaply produced LPS of country, Hawaiian, Latin, and other musical genres; often performed by pseudonymous studio groups; as well as jazz and blues material reissued from the Modern label.

==Major labels enter the budget album market==
In 1954 Pickwick entered into a licensing arrangement with [[Capitol Records]] giving Pickwick the rights to press and distribute Capitol's secondary and noncurrent titles on their label. Pickwick's records were mostly sold in stores other than record shops such as [[department stores]], [[dimestores]], [[Pharmacy|drugstores]], and [[supermarkets]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; Pickwick later had several subsidiaries such as Bravo, Design, International Award, Hurrah, Grand Prix, and [[Hallmark Records]] in the U.K.

[[RCA Records]] introduced [[RCA Camden Records]] in 1955, a budget label for re-releasing older recordings by currently popular artists on the label or vintage material from previous decades. Occasionally, original music was produced for release on RCA Camden such as children's music and instrumentals. RCA Camden also released single albums of country music recorded especially for the budget label by many of its newer country acts of the 1960s such as [[Connie Smith]], [[Liz Anderson]], and [[Dottie West]] to perhaps encourage sales of the artists' full-priced product. RCA Camden was particularly successful in repackaging older [[Elvis Presley]] recordings on the Camden label, as well as previously released and also unreleased material he recorded for his motion pictures, making these albums among the select few budget albums to actually make the national best-selling charts. At one point the Camden albums were doing so well that two of Presley's major hit singles of the early 1970s - "Burning Love" and "Separate Ways" (and their respective flipsides) made their album debuts not on mainstream RCA released, but on RCA Camden. Not long before Presley's death, RCA sold the Camden label to Pickwick.

The major labels' budget album releases were seldom sold at "drug stores", mainly at [[record shops]] and [[department stores]] just like the full-price product although RCA Camden did on occasion market their albums in speciality "drug store" racks. The major label budget albums usually had eight to ten songs on them (usually nine) as opposed to full-price releases which contained ten to twelve songs.

[[Columbia Records]] re-introduced the [[Harmony Records]] line around the same time for budget releases of older product repackaged. Harmony, however, seldom issued material that had not been previously released (Columbia has used the Harmony name from 1926 through 1932 and again in the late 1940's).

The budget albums' heyday was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when nearly every recording artist of note had one or more such collections on the market. Often these were recordings done for a previous record label before the star's current popularity.

Other major labels of the day with their own budget lines include:
*[[Atlantic Records]] had a short-lived budget label, [[Clarion Records]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/clarion.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cameo-Parkway]] created [[Wyncote Records]]
*[[Columbia Records]]' budget label was [[Harmony Records]]
*[[Decca Records]]' budget label was [[Vocalion Records]]
*[[EMI]] created [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] (In the UK)
*[[Dot Records]]' budget label was [[Hamilton Records]]
*[[Liberty Records]]' budget label was [[Sunset Records]]
*[[Mercury Records]] operated [[Wing Records]]
*[[MGM Records]] released [[Metro Records]] and [[Lion Records (MGM)|Lion Records]]
*[[Modern Records]] created Crown Records&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/crown.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RCA Victor Records]] released [[RCA Camden Records]] 
*[[Starday Records]] (arguably a budget label itself) created Nashville Records
*[[United Artists Records]] produced [[Unart Records]]

Other budget record labels were [[Somerset Records]] that became [[Alshire Records]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="spaceagepop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/shermana.htm|title=Al Sherman|publisher=spaceagepop.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo Fidelity, Audio Spectrum, Peter Rabbit (children's records), Azteca,&lt;ref&gt;Pavlakis, Christopher ''the American Music Handbook" Collier-Macmillan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Score Records, a subsidiary of [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]], Custom, and [[Diplomat Records (budget)|Diplomat Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014435/http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a product of the [[Synthetic Plastics Company]] who made [[Peter Pan Records]] and Ambassador Records.

In [[United Kingdom|England, UK]] the [[Woolworths Group]] jointly owned [[Embassy Records]] with [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole Records]], later part of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]].

The [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] label was set up in 1965 as a joint venture between [[EMI]], which provided the source material, and the publisher [[Paul Hamlyn]], which handled distribution in so-called non-traditional outlets, such as [[W.H. Smith]], the booksellers. The MFP catalogue consisted of both original material and reissues of existing EMI recordings.

== Notable artists ==

Notable artists to have begun their careers recording for budget albums include [[Lou Reed]], [[Jerry Cole]],&lt;ref name="hdtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=artistdetail&amp;id=2597|title=Hdtracks - UK Home page &amp;#124; HDtracks - The World's Greatest-Sounding Music Downloads|publisher=hdtracks.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Ra]], [[Al Kooper]] and [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]]. Perhaps the most notable artists to emerge from a career as a "cover artist" for budget albums include [[Dolly Parton]], who early in her career as a teenaged vocalist, recorded several covers of [[Kitty Wells]] hits for budget album release, and [[Elton John]], who recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] album series.

[[File:Butetown History and Arts Centre logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the Butetown History and Arts Centre]]
'''Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre''' (BHAC) was a historical archive, educational centre and art gallery located in the [[Butetown]] area of [[Cardiff]], Wales. BHAC was founded by Glenn Jordan as a non-profiting organisation with the aim to involve the local people of Butetown to help promote the area's history of the docklands.

==Background==
BHAC was located in the heart of [[Butetown]] (previously known as [[Tiger Bay]]), one of the UK's oldest multi-racial communities.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; The community centre started off as a place for weekly oral history classes and was the initiative of African-American academic, Glenn Jordan, who arrived in Cardiff during the 1980s and decided to stay, hoping to allow the Tiger Bay residents a chance to track the 150-year history of Cardiff Bay.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; Jordan and BHAC have aimed to create an archive of local people's memories, documents and photographs.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; The Centre emerged in 1988 with the help of a small handful of local residents, meeting at the Butetown Community Centre where they learnt interview techniques and recording methods.&lt;ref name="without guarantees 167" /&gt; By 2000 the Centre had recorded several hundred hours of oral history, published several books and was running cultural-political and educational activities for local adults.By 2005 the centre had collected 450 hours of oral history and 3,000 photographs.&lt;ref name="politics of heritage" /&gt; BHAC's collection also includes paintings, photographs and sculptures by local artists.  It occupied a {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} building in the centre of Butetown,&lt;ref name="without guarantees 167" /&gt; which it moved into in 1996 with the help of European funding.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt;

The Centre was featured in a 2001 report, "Creative Regeneration: Lessons from 10 Community Arts Projects", by the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]].&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt;

Visual and performing arts have become increasingly important dimensions of BHAC's work. The centre now runs the Diversity Arts Wales (DAW) programme – an initiative, funded by the Arts Council of Wales, that supports the professional development of artists from ethnic minority backgrounds. DAW also encourages artists, whatever their background, to engage in multicultural and intercultural work.

BHAC has been funded by the Home Office, [[Welsh Assembly]], [[Arts Council for Wales]], [[Cardiff Council]] and various foundations.&lt;ref name="future secured" /&gt; However the BHAC now relies largely on volunteer staff and income from the museum shop.

== Archive== 
One of the main areas within the BHAC is the archive which is the result of over 25 years of collecting history connected to the multicultural area of Cardiff Bay. By 2005 BHAC had collected 3000 photographs and 500 hours of oral history.&lt;ref name="bhac.org"&gt;http://bhac.org/?page_id=910&lt;/ref&gt; The centre’s collection also includes paintings, videos, official documentation and sculptures by local artists. The current priority of the BHAC is to make the archive fully accessible online and to add to the collection, to expand their multimedia displays and educational materials to allow for more exhibitions.&lt;ref name="bhac.org"/&gt; 
[[File:Exhibition room.jpg|thumbnail|One of the Exhibition Rooms at the BHAC, currently being used as an Art Gallery]]

==Visual and Performing Arts==

Since 2003, Butetown History and Arts Centre have held nineteen exhibitions, which have focused on bringing awareness of Wales as a culturally and ethnically diverse nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://butetownhac.org.uk/arts/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the pieces have even been featured on BBC’s ‘Your Paintings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/locations/butetown-history-arts-centre-6400 |title=Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre |publisher=BBC Your Paintings |accessdate=7 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
Within the Butetown History and Arts Centre, there have been a number of books published over the years. All of the books held in the BHAC are based around Cardiff Bay and they all, in one way or another, focus upon the Bay's history such as; 'Butetown &amp; Cardiff Docks' compiled by Brian Lee and Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://butetownhac.org.uk/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==

In May 2016 the centre's committee announced they had no alternative but to close BHAC, because of a lack of new funding. They were looking for a storage facility to preserve their archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ruth Mosalski|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/butetown-history-arts-centre-close-11365080 |title=Butetown History and Arts Centre to close its doors - but needs help to keep archive |work=Wales Online |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is reported as closed in December 2017.

'''Calixte Dakpogan''' (born 1958) is a [[Benin]]ese [[sculptor]] known for his [[installation art|installations]] as well as his masks made out of diverse and original found materials.  A native of [[Pahou]], he currently lives and works in [[Porto Novo]].  Much of his work is inspired by his [[Voudon]] heritage.

Dakpogan's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated [[Vodun art]] from Benin and the African Diaspora in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=33 |last=Rush|first=Dana |title=Contemporary Vodun Arts of Ouidah, Benin|journal=African Arts|volume=34|issue=4  |date=Winter 2001|publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center|jstor=3337805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of his masks are part of [[The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC)]] of [[Jean Pigozzi]] and are exhibited in major group shows in museums around the world.

'''Contextualism''' describes a collection of views in [[philosophy]] which emphasize the ''context'' in which an action, [[utterance]], or expression occurs, and argues that, in some important respect, the action, utterance, or expression can only be understood relative to that context.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Price (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as "meaning &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "knowing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "having a reason to &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;", and possibly even "being true" or "being right" only have meaning relative to a specified context. Some philosophers&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; hold that context-dependence may lead to [[relativism]];&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, contextualist views are increasingly popular within philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[ethics]], "contextualist" views are often closely associated with [[situational ethics]], or with [[moral relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timmons (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architectural theory]], contextualism is a theory of design wherein modern (not be confused with modernism) building types are harmonized with urban forms usual to a traditional city.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==

===Introduction===
In [[epistemology]], contextualism is the treatment of the word 'knows' as [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]].  Context-sensitive expressions are ones that "express different propositions relative to different contexts of use".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some terms that are relatively uncontroversially considered context-sensitive are [[indexical]]s, such as 'I', 'here', and 'now'.  While the word 'I' has a constant [[linguistic meaning]] in all contexts of use, whom it refers to varies with context. Similarly, epistemic contextualists argue that the word 'knows' is context sensitive, expressing different relations in some different contexts.

Contextualism was introduced, in part, in order to undermine skeptical arguments that have this basic structure:
# I don't know that I am not in a skeptical scenario H (e.g., I'm not a brain in a vat)
# If I don't know that H is not the case, then I don't know an ordinary proposition O (e.g., I have hands)
# Conclusion: Therefore, I don't know O
Contextualist solution is not to deny any premise, nor to say that the argument does not follow, but link the truth value of (3) to the context, and say that we can refuse (3) in context—like everyday conversational context—where we have different requirements to say we know.

The main tenet of contextualist epistemology, no matter what account of knowledge it is wedded to, is that knowledge attributions are context-sensitive.  Then the truth values of out term "know" depend on the context in which it is used . We can realize that in the context in which the standards to claim truthfully knowledge are so high—e. e., in skeptical context—if we said something like 'I know that I have hands' then this statement would be false. Nevertheless,  if we utter the same proposition in an ordinary context—e.g., in a cafe with friends--, where lower standards are in place , the statement would be truth, even more, it's negation would be false. So, only when we participate in philosophical discourses of the skeptical sort, do we seem  to lose our knowledge. However, once we leave the skeptical context, we  can truthfully say we have knowledge.

That is, when we attribute knowledge to someone, the context in which we use the term 'knowledge' determines the standards relative to which "knowledge" is being attributed (or denied).  If we use it in everyday conversational contexts, the contextualist maintains, most of our claims to "know" things are true, despite skeptic's attempts to show we know little or nothing.  But if the term 'knowledge' is used when skeptical hypotheses are being discussed, we count as "knowing" very little, if anything.  Contextualists use this to explain why skeptical arguments can be persuasive, while at the same time protecting the correctness of our ordinary claims to "know" things.  It is important to note that this theory does not allow that someone can have knowledge at one moment and not the other, for this would hardly be a satisfying epistemological answer. What contextualism entails is that in one context an utterance of a knowledge attribution can be true, and in a context with higher standards for knowledge, the same statement can be false.  This happens in the same way that 'I' can correctly be used (by different people) to refer to different people at the same time.

What varies with context is how well-positioned a subject must be with respect to a proposition to count as "knowing" it.  Contextualism in epistemology then is a [[semantic]] thesis about how 'knows' works in English, not a theory of what knowledge, justification, or strength of epistemic position consists in.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, epistemologists combine contextualism with views about what knowledge is to address epistemological puzzles and issues, such as [[skepticism]], the [[Gettier problem]], and the [[Lottery paradox]].

Contextualist accounts of knowledge became increasingly popular toward the end of the 20th century, particularly as responses to the problem of [[skepticism]].  Contemporary contextualists include Michael Blome-Tillmann, [[Michael Williams (philosopher)|Michael Williams]], Stewart Cohen, [[Keith DeRose]], [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Gail Stine]], and George Mattey.

Thus, the standards for attributing knowledge to someone, the contexualist claims, vary from one user's context to the next. Thus, if I say "John knows that his car is in front of him", the utterance is true if and only if (1) John believes that his car is in front of him, (2) the car is in fact in front of him, and (3) John meets the epistemic standards that my (the speaker's) context selects. This is a loose contextualist account of knowledge, and there are many significantly different theories of knowledge that can fit this contextualist template and thereby come in a contextualist form.

For instance, an [[evidentialism|evidentialist]] account of knowledge can be an instance of contextualism if it's held that strength of justification is a contextually varying matter.  And one who accepts a [[Relevant alternatives theory|relevant alternative's]] account of knowledge can be a contextualist by holding that what range of alternatives are relevant is sensitive to conversational context. DeRose adopts a type of modal or "safety" (as it has since come to be known) account on which knowledge is a matter of one's belief as to whether or not p is the case matching the fact of the matter, not only in the actual world, but also in the sufficiently close possible worlds: Knowledge amounts to there being no "nearby" worlds in which one goes wrong with respect to p. But how close is sufficiently close? It's here that DeRose takes the modal account of knowledge in a contextualist direction, for the range of "epistemically relevant worlds" is what varies with context: In high standards contexts one's belief must match the fact of the matter through a much wider range of worlds than is relevant to low standards contexts.

===Example===
It is claimed that [[neurophilosophy]] has the goal of ''contextualizing''. "We must contextualize questions usually dealt with in the physical and epistemological domains into the context of the empirical domain, the domain of observation in third-person perspective." "Rather than approaching the metaphysical and epistemological issues [about the nature and features of brain and mind] from a mind-based (as in traditional philosophy) or brain-reductive (as in neuroscience) perspective, we therefore pursue a brain-based strategy and thus a non-reductive neurophilosophy." "The various arguments against the material or lphysicalistic view of consciousness...are directly compared with the empirical data and are thus put into the empirical, that is, neuroscientific context of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Northoff, Georg (2014) p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
However, contextualist epistemology has been criticized by several philosophers.  Contextualism is opposed to any general form of ''[[Invariantism]]'', which claims that knowledge is not context-sensitive (i.e. it is invariant).  More recent criticism has been in the form of rival theories, including ''Subject-Sensitive Invariantism'' (SSI), mainly due to the work of [[John Hawthorne]] (2004), and ''Interest-Relative Invariantism'' (IRI), due to [[Jason Stanley]] (2005).  SSI claims that it is the context of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards, whereas Contextualism maintains it is the attributor.  IRI, on the other hand, argues that it is the context of the practical interests of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards.  Stanley writes that bare IRI is "simply the claim that whether or not someone knows that ''p'' may be determined in part by practical facts about the subject's environment."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ("Contextualism" is a misnomer for either form of Invariantism, since "Contextualism" among epistemologists is considered to be restricted to a claim about the context-sensitivity of knowledge attributions (or the word "knows").  Thus, any view which maintains that something other than knowledge attributions are context-sensitive is not, strictly speaking, a form of Contextualism.) DeRose (2009) responds to recent attacks on contextualism, and argues that contextualism is superior to these recent rivals.

An alternative to contextualism called [[contrastivism]] has been proposed by [[Jonathan Schaffer]]. Contrastivism, like contextualism, uses semantic approaches to tackle the problem of skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental research===
Recent work in the new field of [[experimental philosophy]] has taken an empirical approach to testing the claims of contextualism and related views. This research has proceeded by conducting experiments in which ordinary non-philosophers are presented with vignettes which involve a knowledge ascription. Participants are then asked to report on the status of that knowledge ascription. The studies address contextualism by varying the context of the knowledge ascription, e.g., how important it is that the agent in the vignette has accurate knowledge.

In the studies completed up to this point, no support for contextualism has been found.&lt;ref&gt;See Feltz and Zarpentine (2010), May, Sinnott-Armstrong, Hull, and Zimmerman (2010), and Buckwatler (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This critique of contextualism can be summed up as: stakes have no impact on evidence. More specifically, non-philosophical intuitions about knowledge attributions are not affected by the importance to the potential knower of the accuracy of that knowledge. Some may argue that these empirical studies for the most part have not been well designed for testing contextualism, which claims that the context of the attributor of "knowledge" affects the epistemic standards that govern their claims.  Because most of the empirical studies don't vary the stakes for the attributor, but for the subject being described, these studies are more relevant to the evaluation of John Hawthorne's "Subject-Sensitive Invariantism" or Jason Stanley's "Interest-Relative Invariantism"—views on which the stakes for the putative subject of knowledge can affect whether that subject knows—than they are of contextualism. However, Feltz &amp; Zarpentine (forthcoming) have tested the stakes for both the subject and the attributor, and the results are not in keeping with contextualism. Experimental work continues to be done on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Schaffer and Knobe (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Energy Neutral Design''' is a Design of any type (Website, Multi-media, Architecture, Art, Music, Entertainment, etc.) that has the environment and low energy consumption practices in mind during all stages of planning and production.

Energy neutral design can also refer to environmentally powered electronics, where devices absorb or harvest energy from the immediate surroundings and transform it to the electricity they require for their operation.  One example of this is the [[Batteryless_radio]].  More recently wireless sensor networks and internet of things devices have featured energy neutral designs where light, heat, motion or other forms of energy are converted to electricity.

'''Fan art''' is artwork created by [[Fan (person)|fan]]s of a work of [[fiction]] and derived from a series [[Character (arts)|character]] or other aspect of that work. As [[fan labor]], fan art refers to artworks that are neither created nor (normally) commissioned or endorsed by the creators of the work from which the fan art derives.

A different, older meaning of the term is used in [[science fiction fandom]], where fan art traditionally describes ''original'' (rather than derivative) artwork related to [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]], created by fan artists, and appearing in low- or non-paying publications such as [[semiprozine]]s or [[science fiction fanzine|fanzine]]s, and in the art shows of [[science fiction conventions]]. The [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Best Fan Artist]] has been given each year since 1967 for artists who create such works. Like the term [[fan fiction]] (although to a lesser extent), this traditional meaning is now sometimes confused with the more recent usage described above.

==Forms==

Fan art can take many forms. In addition to traditional paintings and drawings, fan artists may also create web banners, avatars, graphic designs or web-based animations, as well as photo collages, posters, artistic representations of quotes from a work or artistic representations of characters in new contexts or in contexts that are in keeping with the original series.

The broad availability of [[digital image processing]] and the Internet has greatly increased the scope and potential reach of fan art. U.S. TV producer [[Bryan Konietzko]] wrote in 2013:
:"I remember back in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender|Avatar]]'' days [2005–2008]… the typical fanart we would get would be a charming, childish crayon drawing stuffed in an envelope. Nowadays on ''[[The Legend of Korra|Korra]]'', I take a skewed screenshot with my phone, post it, and shortly thereafter someone un-skews it, crops it, separates the character levels, clones the background, “[[Ken Burns effect|Ken Burns]]” it with a multilevel slide, animates the characters blinking and talking, tints it, and makes a [[Animated GIF|GIF]] out of it, that I then see on the same phone with which I took the original picture. Times they are a-changin’…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Konietzko|first=Bryan|title=I remember back in the Avatar days…|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/46687253373/i-remember-back-in-the-avatar-days-the-typical|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Due to the nature of fan art, there are many debated facets of the topic. One of the most prominent controversies surrounding fan art is its validity as art at all. Some people in the art community believe that since fan art is based on someone else's original content, it doesn't deserve to be considered "art." Their definition of [[art]] entails that it must be an expression of the artist, and artwork that is derived from already-existing content cannot fulfill this. A counter-argument to this statement is that fan artists add their own individual style to the art they create. Although the concept may derive from someone else's work, the content equally as individualistic and expressive as any other form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fanart|title=Fanart - Fanlore|publisher=[[Fanlore]]|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Copyright ==
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2010}}

===United States===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The legal status of derivative fan made art in America may be tricky due to the vagaries of the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. Generally, the right to reproduce and display pieces of artwork is controlled by the original author or artist under [[17 U.S.C.]] § 106. Fan art using settings and characters from a previously created work could be considered a [[derivative work]], which would place control of the copyright with the owner of that original work. Display and distribution of fan art that would be considered a derivative work would be unlawful.

However, American copyright law allows for the production, display and distribution of derivative works if they fall under a [[fair use]] exemption, 17 U.S.C. § 107. A court would look at all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether a particular use qualifies as fair use; a multi-pronged rubric for this decision involves evaluating the amount and substantiality of the original appropriated, the transformative nature of the derivative work, whether the derivative work was done for educational or noncommercial use, and the economic effect that the derivative work imposes on the copyright holder's ability to make and exploit their own derivative works. None of these factors is alone dispositive.

American courts also typically grant broad protection to [[parody]], and some fan art may fall into this category. This has not explicitly been adjudicated with respect to fan art, however. Moreover, while parody is typically afforded protection under § 107, a court must engage in a fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry for each work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14127">The '''Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative''' is a five-year program, supported by Swiss bank [[UBS]] in which the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] identifies and works with artists, curators and educators from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invites one curator from the chosen region to the [[Solomon R Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]] for a two-year curatorial residency, where he or she works with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities.&lt;ref name=vogel3&gt;Vogel, Carol.

[[File:La fenaison, Rosa Bonheur.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Rosa Bonheur]], ''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''', 1854]]
'''''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''' (French: ''Fenaison d'Auvergne'' or ''La fenaison en Auvergne'') is an 1854 oil painting by French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]].  It measures {{convert|2.15|x|4.22|m}}.  

After her first great artistic success, ''[[Ploughing in the Nivernais]]'' exhibited in 1849, Bonheur showed studies of two new paintings to French Minister of Fine Arts [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny]].  He rejected one, ''[[The Horse Fair]]'', and commissioned ''Haymaking in the Auvergne'' instead.  Bonheur focussed on completing ''The Horse Fair'' first, and De Morny attempted to change his mind after its good reception at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1853. 

The painting depicts the loading of a [[hay]] onto a cart pulled by four oxen.  The beasts to the right wait patiently, attended by a man in wide-brimmed hat.  Other men are cutting grass with scythes, while women rake up the hay, and other people use [[pitchforks]] to lift the hay onto a large pile on the cart.  

The painting was bought by the French state in 1854 for 20,000 francs.  It won a gold medal when it was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1855, as a pendant to ''Ploughing in the Nivernais''.  It was also exhibited as part of the retrospective of 18th century French art at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]. 

The painting was held at the [[Musée du Luxembourg]] from 1874 to 1878, and then moved to the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], where it remains. A smaller version, {{convert|71.1|x|129|cm}} is in a private collection.  The print of an engraving by [[William Turner Davey]] was published in London in 1878 by [[Louis Brall]] &amp; Sons.

'''''Inventions That Changed the World''''' is a five-part [[BBC Two]] documentary series presented by [[Jeremy Clarkson]]. First broadcast on 15 January 2004, the programme takes a look at some of the inventions that helped to shape the modern world. The UKTV channel ''Yesterday'' frequently repeats this series.

'''Jacob's Pillow''' is a dance center, school and performance space located in [[Becket, Massachusetts]], in the [[Berkshires]]. The organization is known for the oldest internationally acclaimed Summer dance festival in the United States.   The facility also includes a professional school and extensive archives as well as year-round community programs.  The facility itself was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 2003.

==Mission statement==
The Jacob's Pillow mission is to support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation; and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob's Pillow Dance Mission Statement|url=http://www.jacobspillow.org/about/pillowmission.php|publisher=Jacob's Pillow Dance|accessdate=15 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127065840/http://jacobspillow.org/about/pillowmission.php|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of Jacob's Pillow in [[Becket, Massachusetts]] was originally settled in 1790 by the Carter family.  Because of the zigzagging road leading to the hilltop property, it became known as "Jacob's Ladder", and a pillow-shaped rock on the property prompted the farm to acquire the name "Jacob's Pillow".

The farm was purchased in 1931 by modern dance pioneer [[Ted Shawn]] as a dance retreat.  Shawn and his wife, [[Ruth St. Denis]], led the highly regarded [[Denishawn Company]], which had popularized dance forms rooted in theater and cultural traditions outside European ballet.  They were influential in training a host of dance pioneers, including [[Martha Graham]], [[Charles Weidman]], [[Doris Humphrey]], and [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]].
[[File:Shawn on Pillow Rock.jpg|thumb|300px|Ted Shawn laying his head upon the Jacob's Pillow Rock.]]

Shawn's objective was to establish a dance organization for American men.  The early corps of his all-male company built many of the structures on the Jacob's Pillow campus.  This effort came to an end in 1940 with the advent of the [[Second World War]]; Shawn's company disbanded and most of its members joined the military.

Significant debt forced Shawn to consider sale of the property.  In 1940 he leased the property to dance teacher Mary Washington Ball, but her summer festival was also financially unsuccessful.  British ballet stars [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] learned of Shawn's financial difficulties, and decided to acquire the property.  With financial backing and fundraising support from millionaire Reginald Wright, $50,000 was raised to purchase the property and construct a theater building.  The summer dance festival was revived, and Shawn was retained as its director until his death in 1972.

In 2003, the Jacob's Pillow property was declared a [[National Historic Landmark District]] by the federal government as "an exceptional cultural venue that holds value for all Americans." It is the only dance entity in the U.S. to receive this honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jacobspillow.org/exhibits-archives/history/&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Jacob's Pillow was named a recipient of the 2010 [[National Medal of Arts]], a national award of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Bolger, Toni. [http://www.jacobspillow.org/about/National%20Medal%20of%20Arts%20ReleaseFINAL.pdf "Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival Awarded National Medal of Arts"]. "Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival", March 1st 2011, accessed July 12th 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Festival==
The Pillow presents international dance in many forms, styles, and traditions, and approximately 200 free events each season, including performances, lectures, tours, films, exhibits, and talks with artists from all over the world, culminating in approximately 80,000 visitors annually.

[[File:InsideOutStage.jpg|thumb|300px|A performance on the Inside/Out Stage.]]

Pillow founder Ted Shawn was instrumental in beginning the careers of [[Martha Graham]] and [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], and the Pillow has continued this mentoring role in the careers of artists such as [[Alvin Ailey]], [[José Limón]], and [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. Companies such as [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]], the [[Parsons Dance Company]], and [[Trey McIntyre Project]] made their debuts at the Pillow, and international groups such as The [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[Nederlands Dans Theatre]], [[Black Grace]] and [[Hofesh Shechter|Hofesh Shechter Company]] have made their U.S. debuts here. World premieres have been commissioned from choreographers such as [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], and artists such as [[Margot Fonteyn]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] have been showcased in works.

Performances at Jacob's Pillow take place on three stages. The Ted Shawn Theatre has a capacity of 620 reserved seats. The Doris Duke Studio Theatre, built in 1990 as a flexible, experimental space, has 220 seats. Talks by Pillow Scholars-in-Residence take place before every performance in these two theaters. Additionally, Post-Show Talks happen in the Ted Shawn Theatre on Thursdays and in the Doris Duke Studio Theatre on Fridays, giving audiences an opportunity to engage with artists in moderated Q&amp;A sessions.

The third stage is Inside/Out, which presents free performances of established and emerging artists from all over the world in an informal, outdoor venue set against a panoramic vista of the Berkshire hills. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays feature emerging artists, and Saturdays showcase the dancers of The School at Jacob's Pillow. Each performance at Inside/Out concludes with a Q&amp;A session with the artists. Artist featured in Inside/Out include: [[Pilobolus (dance company)|Pilobolus Dance Theater]], [[Nadine Bommer]] Dance Company, Reggie "Regg Roc" Gray, [[Michelle Dorrance]] with Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Dušan Týnek Dance Theatre, Abarukas, Manuel Vignoulle, and Laurie M. Taylor.

Another facet of Jacob's Pillow's ongoing educational efforts is the PillowTalk series, which covers the art of dance and artists performing each week through intimate panel discussions, interviews, film screenings, and book signings. Exhibits are free and open to the general public, as are The Archives, which offer the opportunity to view videos, read books, access the Pillow's computer catalog, or view The Pillow's permanent collections of programs and photographs. Free historical walking tours are available to the public weekly during the summer.

==The School at Jacob's Pillow==
[[File:Rep.MMattox.11.MvanSleen.jpg|thumb|300px|Students of The School at Jacob's Pillow in rehearsal.]]

The School at Jacob's Pillow's conservatory-style curriculum includes five programs: Ballet, Cultural Traditions, Contemporary Traditions, Jazz/Musical Theater, and Choreographers’ Lab. The dancers’ schedule includes six days each week with four professional-level studio classes each day, coaching sessions, weekly performances for the public, master classes with Festival artists, talks led by Scholars-in-Residence, study assignments in the Pillow's rare and extensive Archives, and attendance at all Festival performances and events.

The School at Jacob's Pillow is known for its faculty. Faculty of The School at Jacob's Pillow have included Susan Jaffe, Amanda McKerrow, Chet Walker, [[Nikolaj Hubbe]], Anna-Marie Holmes, Milton Myers, [[Katherine Dunham]], Rennie Harris, [[Matt Mattox]], Soledad Barrio, [[Tim Rushton]], Finis Jhung, Martin Santangelo, Mercedes Ellington, Stephanie Saland, Victor Plotnikov, Annie-B Parson, Paul Lazar, Aszure Barton, Helen Pickett, Banu Ogan, [[Mr. Wiggles]], Marjory Smarth, Dana Moore, and Ric Ryder.

Alumni of The School include [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Grant]]-winner [[Meredith Monk]], choreographer [[Mia Michaels]], former [[Alvin Ailey Dance Theater]] and [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]] principal [[Linda Kent]], artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet [[Nikolaj Hübbe]], recent winner of FOX's television show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', [[Joshua Allen]], and Robert Swinston of [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]].

==Community programs==
Jacob's Pillow's Community Dance Programs annually reach more than 3,000 Berkshire children, students, educators, special needs groups, continuing education adult learners, and dancers of all ages and levels of experience. The programs take place at the Pillow, in schools and other settings, and are designed to connect a wide range of participants with the intellectual, emotional, inspirational, as well as physical, world of dance.

Each year, Berkshire County students and teachers choreograph dances to explore topics required for mastery in academic classes, including science, math, history, and communication.  The ''Jacob's Pillow Curriculum in Motion'' program, places Pillow artists in the classroom to develop and teach curricula that meet state and national arts and academic standards.

The Pillow partners with community organizations throughout Berkshire County to provide access to dance activities and learning from Festival artists and staff. A year-round partnership with the Railroad Street Youth Project promotes teen leadership and community involvement through the development of choreographic work. During the Festival, the Pillow partners with Berkshire Institute for Lifelong Learning; Elderhostel Programs; and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s Days In The Arts and Shakespeare &amp; Co. Arts for All programs. The Pillow provides these groups with dance classes, guided tours, performance and School observation opportunities, and access to artists and staff.

==The archives==
The core collections preserved in the archives at Jacob's Pillow were originally assembled by founder Ted Shawn. Materials have been continually added since the 1930s by volunteers from the Pillow Board and staff. In 1991, Jacob's Pillow created the position of Director of Preservation to direct the activities and maintenance of the Archives. The Archives at Jacob's Pillow has approximately 6,000 films and videos from 1894 to present, 45,000 historic dance photos and negatives, 313,000 pages of unique printed materials, 27 trunks of costumes dating from 1915, and 2,000 books. The Archives is one component of the Pillow's Preservation Program, which organizes exhibits exploring various aspects of dance, oversees issues concerning the National Historic Landmark site, and records the ongoing activities of the Festival.

The Archives is internationally recognized as a major repository of dance materials. Access to the research facility is open to the public year-round by appointment and is available during the summer season from noon until the end of each performance, six days a week. The Archives collection is electronically catalogued, and much of it is accessible through the Pillow's website.

Blake's Barn is an 18th-century structure that was relocated and reconfigured specifically for preservation activity. This facility was donated by stage and screen dancer/actress Marge Champion and is named in honor of her late son. In addition to a central area for exhibits and lectures, the building houses a reading room with video stations providing access to the moving image collection. The lower level contains temperature-controlled storage areas and video production equipment.

Jacob's Pillow remains at the forefront of the dance preservation field partly through its active participation in the Dance Heritage Coalition, an alliance of the country's eight major dance collections including the Library of Congress, Harvard Theatre Collection, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Coalition is currently chaired by Norton Owen, the Pillow's longtime Director of Preservation.

In 2008, the Pillow was invited by the Nonprofit Finance Fund, with support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, to participate in the five-year Leading for the Future: Innovative Support for Artistic Excellence Initiative. With this funding, the Archives’ resources can be used in ways that add context and deepen understanding about individual artists and dance traditions, and help audiences around the world understand new and evolving forms.

In 2011, Jacob's Pillow launched Jacob's Pillow Dance Interactive, an online resource of video clips curated from the Archives in Becket. The archive features performances that have taken place at the festival from 1937 to 2010, including footage rarely seen. This user-friendly free resource allows the user to browse dance footage by artist, genre, and era. The director of preservation, Norton Owen, curates the collection. Each entry includes a video clip, an informative paragraph describing the dancer/choreographer, and an artist portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Stephanie.

'''John Varley''' (17 August 1778{{snd}}17 November 1842) was an English [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[astrologer]], and a close friend of [[William Blake]]. They collaborated in 1819–1820 on the book ''[[Visionary Heads]]'', written by Varley and illustrated by Blake.  He was the elder brother of a family of artists: [[Cornelius Varley]], William Fleetwood Varley, and Elizabeth, who married the painter [[William Mulready]].

==Life and work==

John Varley was born at the ''Old Blue Post Tavern'', [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], on 17 August 1778. His father, Richard Varley, born at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire|Epworth]] in [[Lincolnshire]], had settled in [[London]] after the death of his first wife in [[Yorkshire]]. His parents discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a silversmith.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Varley, John|volume=27|page=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on their death he was for a brief time employed by a portrait painter in [[Holborn]] and then, at the age of 15 or 16, he became a pupil of Joseph Charles Barrow ([[floruit|fl.]] 1789–1802) who had an evening drawing school twice a week at 12 Furnival's Inn Court, Holborn. It was Barrow who took Varley on a sketching tour to [[Peterborough]] from which he emerged as a professional painter. In 1798 he exhibited a highly regarded sketch of [[Peterborough Cathedral]] at the [[Royal Academy]] and became a regular exhibitor at the RA until the foundation of the ''[[Royal Watercolour Society|Old Watercolour Society]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1799 he visited [[North Wales]], and in its wild mountain scenery found the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned to the same district in 1800, and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the whole course of his art.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

As one of the founders of the OWS, Varley exhibited largely there over 700 drawings. He also became a highly successful drawing master with pupils including [[Copley Fielding]], [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] and [[William Turner (artist)]] of Oxford. Despite his success, his growing family meant he was constantly in financial difficulties, "since he was both a hopeless businessman and by temperament something of a [[Wilkins Micawber|Micawber]]". (Mallalieu). Varley was particularly skilled at the laying of flat washes of watercolour which suited the placid, contemplative mood that he often sought to evoke.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Varley published ''A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Drawing'', 1816–21 and ''A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective''. He also wrote an [[astrological]] text (with illustrations) entitled ''A Treatise on [[Zodiac]]al [[Physiognomy]]'' in 1828.

He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=101|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], "Varley's landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints, usually without any admixture of body-colour. Though his works are rather mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his "Views of the Thames," were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery, produced without direct reference to nature."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] delivering a lecture at the [[Berlin University]] in 1828 (sketch after nature and lithograph by [[Franz Theodor Kugler|Franz Kugler]])]]
{{Hegelianism}}
'''''Lectures on Aesthetics''''' ('''''LA'''''; {{lang-de|Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik}}, '''''VÄ''''') is a compilation of notes from university lectures on [[aesthetics]] given by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in Heidelberg in 1818 and in Berlin in 1820/21, 1823, 1826 and 1828/29. It was compiled in 1835 by his student [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]], using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art'', trans. T. M. Knox, 2 vols. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Houlgate, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[György Lukács]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Arthur Danto]]. Hegel was himself influenced by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Heidegger calls Hegel's ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' "the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of [[art]] that the West possesses".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Gesamtausgabe'', vol. 5, Frankfurt, 1977, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Hegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls "the beautiful ideal," which he defines most generally as &lt;blockquote&gt;Now when truth in this its external existence [''Dasein''] is present to consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but ''beautiful''. ''Beauty'' is determined as the sensible ''shining'' of the Idea.&lt;ref&gt;(''LA'' 111/''VÄ'' I.151)&lt;/ref&gt;     &lt;/blockquote&gt;This ideal is developed throughout the ''Lectures'' accordance Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]'':
#The first ''universal'' part is devoted to the concept of the artistic ideal.
#The second ''particular'' part examines this ideal as it actualizes itself in three stages:
##Symbolic art, understood to encompass everything before Classical Greek art
##Classical art
##Romantic art, understood to emerge with the advent of Christianity on the world stage
#The third ''singular'' part concerns itself with an examination of each of the five major arts in ascending order of "inwardness":
##[[architecture]]
##sculpture
##[[painting]]
##[[music]]
##poetry

In these second two parts of the ''Lectures'', Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically [[symbol]]ic architecture to the paradigmatically classical [[sculpture]] to the [[romantic poetry|romantic]] arts of painting, music, and [[poetry]]. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it.&lt;!-- Citation? --&gt;

Contrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be "dead." What he says, in a representative statement is, "For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''LA'' 103/''VÄ'' I.141&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks frequently of its "dissolution" [''Auflösung''], not its end [''Ende''], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.

[[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Apocalyptic fiction]] is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that is concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] due to a potentially [[existential risk|existential catastrophe]] such as [[nuclear warfare]], [[pandemic]], [[alien invasion|extraterrestrial attack]], [[impact event]], [[cybernetic revolt]], [[technological singularity]], [[dysgenics]], [[supernatural phenomena]], [[Eschatology|divine judgment]], [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]] or some other [[disaster|general disaster]]. [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-apocalyptic fiction]] is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).
 
''[[Apocalypse]]'' is a Greek word referring to the end of the world. [[Apocalypticism]] is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will, but now usually refers to belief that the world will come to an end very soon, even within one's own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apocalypticism |title=Dictionary-Apocalypticism |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalyptic fiction does not portray catastrophes, or disasters, or near-disasters that do not result in apocalypse.  A ''threat'' of an apocalypse does not make a piece of fiction apocalyptic. For example, ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' are considered [[disaster film]]s and not apocalyptic fiction because, although earth and/or human-kind are terribly threatened, in the end they manage to avoid destruction. Apocalyptic fiction is not the same as fiction that provides visions of a [[dystopian]] future.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', for example, is [[dystopian fiction]], not apocalyptic fiction.

A '''litblog''' (alternate: '''lit-blog''' or '''literary blog''')  is a [[blog]] that focuses primarily on the topic of [[literature]]. There is a community of litblogs in the [[blogosphere]] whose authors cover a variety of literary topics. Litbloggers may write about fiction, nonfiction, poetry, the publishing industry, literary journals, literary criticism, and more.  They may focus on special genres of literature, including science fiction and mystery.  Some litbloggers prefer an objective or formal tone, while others are more conversational.

Many litblogs feature reviews of books which may or may not be featured in the mainstream press. Some litblogs feature critiques of reviews in the mainstream press.  Interviews with authors are another common feature. Litblogs can also be used as virtual reading groups for focused discussion on a specific piece or pieces of literature, with some litblogs following a particular piece of literature through an entire reading, and others reprinting diaries or letters from authors.  Some litblogs are resources for information about the publishing industry, publicity, or writing craft.

Many litblogs have one author, but collaborative blogs have many authors, one of whom may serve as the primary author overseeing contributors.  There are also collaborative blogs focussing on significant international or national literary awards such as [http://readnobels.blogspot.com/ Read the Nobels] and [http://completebooker.blogspot.com/ The Complete Booker] where contributors share reviews of winning and shortlisted titles, information about award-winning authors or the history of the award. These are sometimes associated with so-called 'reading challenges' but they can become a useful repository of commentary about award winners and their books over time, especially in the case of less well-known authors. 
Other collaborative blogs include those focusing on the work of a single notable author such as [http://balzacbooks.wordpress.com/ La Comedie Humaine] where members share their summaries and reviews as well as information about the French author, [[Honoré de Balzac]].

== Examples ==
[[Bookslut]], [[Laila Lalami]], [[Complete_review|The Literary Saloon]], and [[Maud Newton]] are some of the oldest well-known active literary blogs. [[Moby Lives]], one of the oldest literary blogs, was recently defunct, but has returned on the [[Melville House Publishing]] website.  [[Litkicks]], run by [[Levi Asher]] is the oldest-known literary blog of its kind and also remains active. 

See also: [[HTML Giant]], [[Reader of Depressing Books]], [[No One Does That]], and [[The Rumpus]]. [http://abandonedbooks.blogspot.com Abandoned Books] reviews books and authors not much discussed on the web any more but which were bestsellers in their day.[http://abandonedbooks.blogspot.com/2006/05/abandoned-books.html] The blog's owner, Doug Bassett, is interested in bestsellers of the past, "partly because there seems to be a real dearth of information on these authors, partly because I'm interested in what books become popular, what these authors share (or don't share)."

Bilingual literary bloggers include [http://bookaroundthecorner.wordpress.com/ Book Around the Corner] (France, written in English), [http://irisonbooks.wordpress.com/ Iris on Books] (Holland, in English), [http://beautyisasleepingcat.wordpress.com/ Beauty is a Sleeping Cat] (Switzerland, in English), [http://caravanaderecuerdos.blogspot.com/ Caravana de Recuerdos] (bilingual Spanish/English).
Some litblogs are profitable businesses while others are not run for profit. Some authors of litblogs are professional writers, academics, literature enthusiasts or industry professionals. Others are simply people who enjoy writing about books.  In the democratic forum of the blogosphere, these groups can interact by reading and commenting on one another's posts.  

Increasingly newspapers and magazines are also creating litblogs.  [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' writes a litblog called Paper Cuts that is hosted by the newspaper. ''[[The Guardian]]'' allows authors to chime in on books and current publishing gossip at a feature called [[guardian.co.uk|Comment is free]]. Litblogs can also serve as adjuncts to literary journals or organizations, such as those of [[3:AM Magazine]], [[Inside Higher Ed]], [[Spike Magazine]], ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', and the [[Poetry Foundation]]. The [[National Book Critics Circle]] has its own litblog called Critical Mass that posts commentary that is very critical of nonprofessional litbloggers.

LitBloggers have also entered the Literary Prize scene by hosting what are called Shadow Literary Prizes, which have no monetary value but offer valuable international publicity to the long and short-listed books, and provide an archive of reviews of the titles, since all the longlisted titles are reviewed by at least one member of the Shadow Jury, and all the shortlisted titles are reviewed by all members.  The Shadow Giller Prize, founded in 1995, was the first of these Shadow Literary Prizes.  Its origins were the inaugural Shadow Giller Lunch of literary critics and people in the publishing industry in 1995, but the concept migrated to the web in 2009.  Coordinated by Kevin From Canada, [http://kevinfromcanada.wordpress.com/] who convenes a 'jury' each year, the Shadow Giller Prize Jury by consensus awards its own Shadow Prize to the book the jury prefers [http://kevinfromcanada.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/2011-the-shadow-giller-is-back/]. In 2011, The Shadow Man Asian Literary Prize began [http://anzlitlovers.com/2011/11/08/shadow-man-asian-literary-prize-2011/]: modelled on the Shadow Giller and coordinated by ANZ LitLovers in Australia [http://anzlitlovers.com/], it also has an international jury of bloggers who commit to the same principle: to criticize a prize, a Shadow Literary Prize Jury makes its choice before the Real Jury makes its announcement.

== Professional ==
Professional critics have litblogs at [[House of Mirth]], About Last Night, [[Inside Higher Ed]], [[The Dizzies]], and more. In addition, the litbloggers from [[The Elegant Variation]], [[Laila Lalami]], [[The Old Hag]], [[Maud Newton]], [[Return of the Reluctant]], [[Bookslut]], [[Ready Steady Book]], [[The Reading Experience]], and [[Sarah Weinman]] are a few of the bloggers writing book reviews and criticism for major newspapers and magazines. The [[National Book Critics Circle]] has its own litblog called [[Critical Mass (blog)|Critical Mass]] that posts commentary that is very critical of nonprofessional litbloggers.  Litblogger Scott Esposito also established [[The Quarterly Conversation]], a quarterly online publication featuring lengthy literary essays.

Some litbloggers, including [[Laila Lalami]] and [[Mark Sarvas]] of [[The Elegant Variation]], are also literary fiction authors.  Many published authors have also started blogs.  Some of these bloggers are [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Alison Bechdel]], and Cory Doctorow of the popular blog [[Boing Boing]].  Writers of [[young adult fiction]] increasingly are blogging as well.  Some of these bloggers are [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Holly Black]], [[Justine Larbalestier]], and [[Scott Westerfeld]].

Group litblogs continue to diversify. A group of academics runs a litblog called The Valve. The Litblog Co-op (disbanded) was a group of 20 litbloggers who voted to collectively recommend a book every three months. In the UK, six leading litblogs joined forces to create Britlitblogs.com. There have been blogs devoted to one book, like William T. Vollmann's ''Rising Up and Rising Down'', and blogs that have reprinted the entire contents of Samuel Pepys' Diary and Franz Kafka's diary. Today in Letters provided letters and diary entries from each day in literary history.

[[Making Light]], [[John Scalzi]], and Miss Snark (the latter now defunct) are written by professionals in the industry who have insights for writers. [http://www.floggingthequill.com/ Flogging the Quill] is a litblog about the craft of writing. [[Book Tour]] is a litblog creation of [[Virtual Book Tour]] founder [[Kevin Smokler]], and [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] (author of ''[[The Long Tail]]''. [[Buzz, Balls &amp; Hype]] is devoted to the creation of buzz for writers.

[[Edward Champion]] from [[Reluctant Habits]] has an author interview podcast series called [[The Bat Segundo Show]].

== Kidlitosphere ==
Recently children's literary bloggers have organized together and brought about an entity best known as the Kidlitosphere. These bloggers include professional reviewers, booksellers, librarians, parents, homeschoolers, authors, illustrators, and anyone else concerned in the field. Some blog professionally for the online editions of print journals, like [[A Fuse#8 Production]] on School Library Journal and [[ShelfTalker]] on [[Publishers Weekly]]. Others do a regular series of interviews and reviews, including [[Seven Impossible Things Before Breakfast]], [[Big A little a]], and [[bookshelves of doom]].

The Kidlitosphere has its own literary award it hands out once a year called [[The Cybils Award]]. They also meet once a year in October for a yearly conference.

The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "good, pleasant, well, [[beauty|beautiful]]" in [[Gardiner's sign list]] is numbered '''F35'''; its phonetic value is '''''{{lang|egy-Latn|nfr}}''''', with a reconstructed pronunciation of {{IPA-all|nafir}}&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno, Antonio. ''Ancient Egyptian: A linguistic introduction''. Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Egyptian_language#Egyptological_pronunciation|conventional Egyptological vocalization]] of '''''{{lang|egy-Latn|nefer}}'''''.

==Hieroglyphs and symbolism==
The [[Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral Egyptian hieroglyph]] F35 ('nfr') has sometimes been explained as a representation of a [[lute]]; however, Egyptologists today no longer consider this hypothesis likely. Rather than a lute, the hieroglyph is actually a representation of the [[heart]] and [[trachea]].&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch" /&gt; It originally may have been the [[esophagus]] and heart. The striations of the [[windpipe]] only appear in the hieroglyph following the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]]. The lower part of the sign has always clearly been the heart, for the markings clearly follow the form of a [[sheep]]'s heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/nefer.htm|title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Nefer (Beauty)|website=www.egyptianmyths.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The term ''{{lang|egy-Latn|nfr}}'' has been incorporated into many names in Ancient Egypt. Examples include [[Nefertiti]], [[Nefertari]], and [[Neferhotep]].

The term was consecutively extremely positive considering that it refers to the heart, which to the ancient egyptians was the home of feelings and intent (good and bad).

Some scholars suggest that it was used in ancient Egyptian construction where 'nfrw' was used to denote 'level zero' of a building and in accounting where 'nfr' would refer to a zero balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lumpkin|first=Beatrice|date=1 March 2002|title=Mathematics Used in Egyptian Construction and Bookkeeping|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=08da3089-acff-49b7-b673-fff93c51f7a3%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=24|pages=20 - 23|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used as a prefix of the name Neferpitou which comes from an Egyptian god, [[Nefertem]], in the anime series ''[[Hunter x Hunter]]'' (2011).

==Pharaoh==
'''Nefer''' was an ancient [[Egypt]]ian pharaoh who ruled for two years, one month, and a day, from 2197–2193 BCE&lt;!--should this be 2195?--&gt;, according to the [[Turin Canon]], though he reigned during the reign of [[Pepi II Neferkare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turin King List |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/history/turin_kinglist/0401_0417.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616112943/http://ancient-egypt.org/history/turin_kinglist/0401_0417.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 June 2006 |date=25 July 2009 |work=The Ancient Egypt Site |publisher=Jacques Kinnaer |accessdate=27 August 2009 }} IV,10: Nefer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Romantic''' movement was a pop culture movement that originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1970s.  The movement emerged from the nightclub scene in [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] at venues such as Billy's and The Blitz.&lt;ref name=Johnson2009&gt;D. Johnson, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/04/spandau-ballet-new-romantics "Spandau Ballet, the Blitz Kids and the birth of the New Romantics"], ''Observer'', 4 October 2009, retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Romantic movement was characterised by flamboyant, eccentric [[fashion]] inspired by fashion boutiques such as PX in London and [[Kahn and Bell]] in Birmingham. Early adherents of the movement were often referred to by the press by such names as [[Blitz Kids]], New Dandies and Romantic Rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapersofthe80s.com/blitz-kids/ |title=BLITZ KIDS, Shapers of the 80s |publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8&gt;T. Cateforis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MVrM3zKrHQC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s''] (University of Michigan Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-472-03470-7}}, pp. 47–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[David Bowie]], [[Marc Bolan]] and [[Roxy Music]], it developed [[glam rock]] and historical fashions, gaining its name from the styles of the early [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]. Several music acts at the start of the 1980s adopted the style of the movement and became known to epitomise it within the music and mainstream press, including [[Steve Strange]] (of [[Visage (band)|Visage]]), [[Duran Duran]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Classix Nouveaux]] and [[Boy George]] (of [[Culture Club]]). [[Ultravox]] were also often identified as New Romantics by the press although they did not exhibit the same visual styles of the movement, despite their link to the band Visage.{{Ref|UltraVisage}}  [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Adam and the Ants]] were also labeled as New Romantic artists by the press, although both repudiated this and neither had any direct connection to the original scene.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt; A number of these bands adopted [[synthesizer]]s and helped to develop [[synth-pop]] in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK, and then, via [[MTV]], play a major part in the [[Second British Invasion]] of the U.S. charts.

By the end of 1981, the original movement had largely dissipated&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; and, although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived [[romo]] movement.

==Characteristics==
The New Romantic movement is sometimes seen as a reaction to punk,&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p132&gt;S. Borthwick and R. Moy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4bmVbNSnk4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+duran&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=lFgrTsbUK9S78gOOvZ3mCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6wEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20duran&amp;f=false ''Popular Music Genres: an Introduction''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7486-1745-0}}, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and was heavily influenced by former [[glam rock]] stars of the 1970s such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Roxy Music]].&lt;ref name=Buckley2005p318&gt;D. Buckley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwzbCdn9zc0C&amp;pg=RA4-PA114&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+%22glam+rock%22&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=axQsTu24JZSq8QP3wLCfDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20%22glam%20rock%22&amp;f=false ''Strange Fascination: David Bowie, the Definitive Story''] (London: Random House, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7535-1002-2}}, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of style it rejected the austerity and anti-fashion stance of punk.&lt;ref&gt;R. Evans, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mDnc4apw_0C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+blitz&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=uyotTun_FsiZhQfn17iqCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20blitz&amp;f=false ''Remember the 80s: Now That's What I Call Nostagia!''] (London: Anova Books, 2009), {{ISBN|1-906032-12-2}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes often dressed in counter-sexual or [[androgyny|androgynous]] clothing and wore cosmetics such as [[eyeliner]] and [[lipstick]], partly derived from earlier punk fashions.&lt;ref name=Steer2009p.37/&gt; This "[[gender bending]]" was particularly evident in figures such as [[Boy George]] of [[Culture Club]] and [[Marilyn (singer)|Marilyn]] (Peter Robinson).&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p132/&gt;

Fashion was based on varied looks inspired by [[Romanticism|historical romantic themes]], including frilly [[fop]] [[Poet shirt|shirts]] in the style of the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period,&lt;ref name=Steer2009p.37&gt;D. C. Steer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgU5OQuHTRcC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=androgyny+%22new+romantic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WIUtTuD4CsKp8QOMzpiMDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The 1980s and 1990s''] (Infobase Publishing, 2009), {{ISBN|1-60413-386-4}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian constructivism]], [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], French [[Incroyables and Merveilleuses|Incroyables]] and 1930s' [[Cabaret]], Hollywood [[Actress|starlets]], [[Puritan]]s and the [[Pierrot|Pierrot clown]], with any look being possible if it was adapted to be unusual and striking.&lt;ref name=Steele2010p525&gt;V. Steele, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hemsvn9ZbRkC&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=new+romantic+fashion&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=Yh8tToPnG8Sw8gOf1bGYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20romantic%20fashion&amp;f=false ''The Berg Companion to Fashion''] (London: Berg, 2010), {{ISBN|1-84788-592-6}}, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Common hairstyles included [[quiff]]s,&lt;ref name=Steele2010p525/&gt; [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]s and wedges.&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p132/&gt; Soon after they began to gain mainstream attention, however, many New Romantic bands dropped the eclectic clothes and make-up in favour of sharp suits.

New Romantic looks were propagated from fashion designer Helen Robinson's Covent Garden shop PX,&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; began to influence major collections and were spread, with a delay, through reviews of what was being worn in clubs via magazines including ''[[i-D]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.&lt;ref name=Steele2010p525/&gt; The emergence of the New Romantic movement into the mainstream coincided with [[Vivienne Westwood]]'s unveiling of her "pirate collection", which was promoted by [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Adam and the Ants]], who were managed by her then partner [[Malcolm McLaren]].&lt;ref&gt;R. O'Byrne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BpOn6lJ68OkC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=vivienne+westwood+new+romantic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kn8sTpvJFYi78gPJ7cmSDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD0Q6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vivienne%20westwood%20new%20romantic&amp;f=false Style City: How London Became a Fashion Capital] (London: Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2895-7}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the post-punk Adam Ant himself has always denied being a New Romantic, and reiterated this in 2012.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead2012&gt;D. Aitkenhead, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/19/adam-ant-sex-style-humour "Adam Ant: To be a pop star you need sex, subversion, style and humour"], "The Guardian", 19 Feb 2012, retrieved 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Japan (band)|Japan]] also refuted any connection with the New Romantic movement, having adopted an androgynous look incorporating make-up ever since their inception in the mid-1970s at the tail-end of the glam rock era, many years before the New Romantic movement began. In an October 1981 interview, vocalist [[David Sylvian]] commented "There's a period going past at the moment that may make us look as though we're in fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Rimmer, Dave. Japanese Boys (an interview with David Sylvian and Mick Karn). Smash Hits. Volume 3, issue 22, pages 42–43, October 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, he stated "I don't like to be associated with them (New Romantics). The attitudes are so very different." Of Japan's fashion sense, Sylvian said "For them (New Romantics), fancy dress is a costume. But ours is a way of life. We look and dress this way every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author-link=| title=Rolling Stone Random Notes| newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News| publication-place=Tuscaloosa, AL| date=17 July 1981| page=6| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ricdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R6UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3175,3968351&amp;dq=japan+sylvian&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the electronic duo [[Soft Cell]] also denied any connection to the New Romantic scene. In an interview published in January 1984, keyboardist [[David Ball (musician)|Dave Ball]] reflected back on their first year of success (1981) and stated "At this time we were linked to the whole New Romantics thing, but we were never a part of that. It was just a trendy London club thing with Steve Strange."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Peter. ''Soft Cell: That Was Then But This Is Now'' (an interview with Marc Almond and Dave Ball). ''Smash Hits''. Volume 6, issue 1, page 6, January 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

While some contemporary bands, particularly those of the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska revival, dealt with issues of unemployment and urban decay, New Romantics adopted an escapist and aspirational stance.&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005p326&amp;410&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 326 and 410.&lt;/ref&gt; With its interest in design, marketing and image, the movement has been seen by some as an acceptance of [[Thatcherism]] and style commentator [[Peter York]] even suggested that it was aligned with the [[New Right]].&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p124&gt;S. Borthwick and R. Moy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4bmVbNSnk4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+duran&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=lFgrTsbUK9S78gOOvZ3mCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6wEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20duran&amp;f=false ''Popular Music Genres: an Introduction''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7486-1745-0}}, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
In its early stages the movement was known by a large number of names, including "new dandies", "romantic rebels", "peacock punk", "the now crowd", "the futurists", "the cult with no name"&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; and eventually as the "Blitz Kids". As the scene moved beyond a single club the media settled on the name New Romantics.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1983p119&gt;T.

Steve Strange worked as the club's doorman and Egan was the [[disk jockey|DJ]] at the Blitz. The club became known for its exclusive door policy and strict dress code. Strange would frequently deny potential patrons admission because he felt that they were not costumed creatively or subversively enough to blend in with those inside the club. In a highly publicised incident, [[Mick Jagger]] tried to enter the club while under the influence of alcohol, but was denied entry by Strange.&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;S. Strange, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83638154.html "The most decadent nightclub in the world"], Originally from the ''Mail on Sunday'', 10 March 2002, ''Highbeam Research'', retrieved 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The club spawned several spin-offs and there were soon clubs elsewhere in the capital and in other major British cities, including Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham.&lt;ref name=Buckley2005p318/&gt;

While still at Billy's, Strange and Egan joined [[Billy Currie]] and [[Midge Ure]] of [[Ultravox]] to form the band [[Visage (band)|Visage]]. Before forming Culture Club, Boy George and Marilyn worked as [[cloakroom]] attendants at the Blitz.&lt;ref&gt;R.

In Birmingham the origins of the New Romantic movement lay in the opening in 1975 of the [[Hurst Street, Birmingham|Hurst Street]] shop of the fashion designers [[Kahn and Bell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rimmer|first=Dave|year=2003|title=New Romantics: The Look|publication-place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|pages=105–106|isbn=0711993963}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose elaborate and theatrical designs brought together futuristic visual elements and influences as diverse as Egyptian, African and Far Eastern art,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1175728/bustier/|title=Bustier|accessdate=30 June 2013|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would largely define the movement's look.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Nick|last=Rhodes|title=How we opened the door to the 1980s|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3651745/How-we-opened-the-door-to-the-1980s.html|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=22 April 2006|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977 a small scene featuring Jane Kahn and Patti Bell themselves, [[Martin Degville]], [[Boy George]] and Patrick Lilley had emerged in pubs such as The Crown and clubs such as Romulus and Barbarella's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rimmer|first=Dave|year=2003|title=New Romantics: The Look|publication-place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|pages=100–102|isbn=0711993963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles of music===
{{Main|Synthpop}}
Many bands that emerged from the New Romantic movement became closely associated with the use of [[synthesizer]]s to create [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]]. This synthpop was prefigured in the 1960s and 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]] [[art rock]], [[disco]], the "[[Kraut rock]]" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]], the three albums made by Bowie with [[Brian Eno]] in his "Berlin period", and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s early albums.

After the breakthrough of [[Tubeway Army]] and [[Gary Numan]] in the [[British Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound and they came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s. Bands that emerged from the New Romantic scene and adopted synthpop included [[Duran Duran]], [[Visage (band)|Visage]], and [[Spandau Ballet]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp334-5&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 334–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early synthpop has been described as "eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing", using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop.&lt;ref name=AMsynthpop&gt;{{Citation |last = |title = Synth pop |journal = Allmusic |date = |url = {{Allmusic |class=explore |id=style/d18 |pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5x6RaN2Dj?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/synth-pop-d18| archivedate =10 March 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Duran Duran, who emerged from the Birmingham scene, have been credited with incorporating a dance-orientated [[rhythm section]] into synthpop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles.&lt;ref name=AMsynthpop/&gt;

Of groups associated with the New Romantic movement, Culture Club avoided a total reliance on synthesizers, producing a sound that combined elements of [[Motown]], the [[Philly sound]] and [[lovers rock]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp412-3&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam and the Ants]] utilised the African influenced rhythms of the "Burundi beat".&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp306-7&amp;311&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 306–7 and 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second British invasion===
{{Main|Second British Invasion}}
In the US the cable music channel [[MTV]] reached the media capitals of New York City and Los Angeles in 1982.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2009&gt;{{Citation|author=T.

They would be followed by a large number of acts, many of them employing synthpop sounds, over the next three years, with Duran Duran's glossy videos symbolising the power of MTV and this [[Second British Invasion]]. The switch to a "[[New Music (music industry)|New Music]]" format in US radio stations was also significant in the success of British bands.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt;

This 80s invasion had been prefigured in May 1981 when the first New Romantic synthpop group [[Spandau Ballet]], house-band of London’s Blitz club, had flown to New York City to stage not only a live gig but a fashion show by the Axiom collective of designers, who included [[Sade Adu]]. These former Blitz Kids, “21 in number and 21 their average age”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shapersofthe80s.com/revolution/1981-first-blitz-invasion-of-the-us/|title=First Blitz invasion of the US, Shapers of the 80s |publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; came by invitation of [[Jim Fouratt]] who hosted the event at the Underground club.

During 1983, 30% of the US record sales were from British acts. On 18 July 1983, 18 singles in the top 40, and 6 in the top 10, were by British artists.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine ran an issue which featured [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Boy George]] on the cover of one of its issues, with the caption "Britain Rocks America&amp;nbsp;– Again", while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' would release an "England Swings" issue with Boy George on the cover.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt; In April 1984, 40 of the top 100 singles, and in a May 1985 survey 8 of the top 10 singles, were by acts of British origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1946331.stm |title=UK acts disappear from US charts |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TarnishedGold&gt;Von R.

[[File:Live Aid at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, PA.jpg|thumb|The [[Live Aid]] stage at the [[JFK Stadium]] in Philadelphia in July 1985, where Duran Duran played, while Ultravox and Spandau Ballet appeared on the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] stage in the UK]]
Music journalist Dave Rimmer considered the [[Live Aid]] concert of July 1985 as the peak for the various acts that rose from the New Romantic scene of the early 80s, commenting that after which "everyone seemed to take hubristic tumbles".&lt;ref&gt;D. Rimmer, ''New Romantics: The Look'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-7119-9396-9}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Reynolds also notes the "[[Do They Know Its Christmas]]" single in late 1984 and Live Aid in 1985 as turning points, with the acts that the movement spawned as having become decadent, with "overripe arrangements and bloated videos" for songs like Duran Duran's "[[Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]" and Culture Club's "[[The War Song]]".&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005p517"&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of acts using synthesisers had led to an anti-synth backlash, with groups including Spandau Ballet, Soft Cell and [[ABC (band)|ABC]] incorporating more conventional influences and instruments into their sounds by 1983.&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005p342&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American reaction against European synthpop and "haircut bands" has been seen as beginning in the mid-1980s with the rise of [[heartland rock]] and [[roots rock]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005p535"&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the arrival of [[indie rock]] bands, particularly [[The Smiths]], has been seen as marking the end of synth-driven [[new wave music|new wave]] and the beginning of the guitar rock that would come to dominate rock into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =S.

In the mid-1990s, the New Romantic era was the subject of nostalgia-oriented club nights&amp;nbsp;— such as the Human League inspired "Don't You Want Me", and "Planet Earth", a Duran Duran-themed night club whose promoter told ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' "It's more of a celebration than a revival".&lt;ref&gt;S. Langan, "Worst of times", ''The Sunday Times'' 19 Nov 1995; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period it was also an inspiration for the short-lived [[romo]] musical movement. It was championed by ''[[Melody Maker]]'', who proclaimed on its front cover in 1995 that it was a "future pop explosion" that had "executed" Britpop, and including bands [[Orlando (band)|Orlando]], Plastic Fantastic, [[Minty (band)|Minty]], Viva, Sexus, Hollywood and Dex Dexter. None made the British top 75,&lt;ref&gt;D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10128">The '''Noma Concours for Picture Book Illustrations''' (Japanese: 野間国際絵本原画コンクール) was organised by Asia/Pacific Cultural Centre for [[UNESCO]] (ACCU) supported by the Noma International Book Development Fund from 1978 to 2008. It was an annual competition, ending in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accu.or.jp/noma/english/e_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was named after [[Shoichi Noma]], the fourth president of the Japanese family-run publishing house [[Kodansha]] Ltd. At the 1963 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], he gave a speech entitled "Cultural Exchange in Publishing", in which he said “In order to advance and sustain world peace, it is most important to develop international mutual understanding by means of cross-cultural interchange through publishing.”  In this spirit, several Noma Awards were set up: the [[Noma Award for Publishing in Africa]], established in  1980; the [[Noma Literary Prize]],  also established in 1980; and the [[Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature]], established in 1980 to commemorate Kodansha’s 80th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;Toyo Yoshizaki, “Books are Silent Ambassadors: The Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature”, Publishing Research Quarterly, Winter 2004, pp.31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the competition was to discover up-and-coming illustrators, graphic designers and artists in Asia (except Japan), the Pacific, Africa, Arab States, and Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and to provide an opportunity at which they could present their works to offer incentives for their creative activities. Prizewinning works were displayed in exhibitions such as the [[International Library of Children's Literature]]&lt;ref&gt;Where Children Meet Books: International Library of Children's Literature, Tokyo Murayama, Takao. Bookbird 45.3 (2007): 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ueno]], Tokyo, and the [[Biennial of Illustration Bratislava]] in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papertigers.org/resources/International/NomaConcours.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="943">'''Opus regulatum''' is the [[Latin]] name for the normal technique of Greek and Roman [[mosaic]], made from [[tesserae]] that are larger than about 4 mm. Tesserae are laid in a pattern like grid or graph paper. The grout lines are aligned both vertically and horizontally unlike [[Opus tessellatum]] which consists of either horizontally or vertically aligned tesserae. It is useful in creating geometric patterns or for a background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17371">A '''pathfinder''' is a [[bibliography]] created to help begin [[research]] in a particular topic or subject area. (Pathfinders are also referred to as subject guides, topic guides, research guides, information portals, resource lists or study guides).  Pathfinders produced by the [[Library of Congress]] are known as "tracer bullets".&lt;ref name=Dunsmore&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunsmore|first1=Carla|title=A Qualitative Study of Web-Mounted Pathfinders Created by Academic Business Libraries|journal=Libri|date=2002|volume=52|pages=137–156|issn=0024-2667}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What is special about a pathfinder is that it only refers to the information in a specific location, i.e. the shelves of a local library.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.G., Joudrey, D.N. (2009) "The Organization of Information." 3rd Edition. Connecticut, Libraries Unlimited.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science, a pathfinder is "designed to lead the user through the process of researching a specific topic, or any topic in a given field or discipline, usually in a systematic, step-by-step way, making use of the best finding tools the library has to offer. Pathfinders may be printed or available online."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first=Joan|title=Pathfinder (definition)|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#pathfinder|work=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a pathfinder is to gather all of the most useful, relevant, reliable and authoritative resources on a variety of academic, work-related or general-interest topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farkas|first=Meredith|title=Pathfinder in a Box: Crafting your own authoritative metasearch engine|journal=American Librarians|date=October 2009|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally provided in print format in the 20th century in large [[Academic library|academic libraries]],&lt;ref name=MorrisBosque/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reeb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reeb|first=Brenda|author2=Susan Gibbons|title=Students, Librarians, and Subject Guides: Improving a Poor Rate of Return|journal=[[Portal: Libraries and the Academy]]|date=January 2004|volume=4|issue=1|pages=123|doi=10.1353/pla.2004.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; pathfinders have evolved with the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] and may now act as portals to information about resources in a variety of formats, including [[book]]s, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[bibliographic database]]s, [[almanac]]s, [[Documentary|documentaries]], [[website]]s, [[search engine]]s and [[Academic journal|journal]]s.

Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources."&lt;ref name="Reeb" /&gt;

==Purpose==
Pathfinders are intended to be a launch point for research on a particular topic, via the collection of select materials available in a particular institution on that topic. However they are not generally an exhaustive collection of all of the materials on a given topic- they are designed for beginners in research to find the fundamental information they need to get started.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, S.H., Canfield, M.P., Jeffery, J.G. (1973) Library Pathfinders: A New Possibility for Cooperative Reference Service. ''[[College &amp; Research Libraries]]'' http://crl.acrl.org/content/34/1/40.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Pathfinders also help to teach essential information and technology skills, and promote books and reading.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, K. (2003) Pathfinders: Helping Students Find Paths to Information. ''Multimedia &amp; Internet Schools.'' Vol 10(3) http://www.infotoday.com/MMSchools/may03/kuntz.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  They are broader in scope than [[subject heading]]s, and have been chosen from university course descriptions, thesis titles, and from term paper titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harbeson|first1=Eloise L.|title=Teaching Reference and Bibliography: The Pathfinder Approach|journal=Journal of Education for Librarianship|date=1972|volume=13|issue=2|pages=111|doi=10.2307/40322211}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For public libraries, it has been suggested to use surveys, past experience and hot topics from local media to find topics for pathfinders.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, H. and Hubbard, W.J. (2004), “Integrating electronic pathfinders in digital libraries: a model for China”, [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]], No. 3334, pp. 618-25. as cited in {{cite journal|last1=Vileno|first1=Luigina|title=From paper to electronic, the evolution of pathfinders: a review of the literature|journal=Reference Services Review|date=7 August 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–451|doi=10.1108/00907320710774300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued to expand the purpose of a research guide from being a list of resources to also incorporating instruction on [[information literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pendell|first1=Kimberly|last2=Armstrong|first2=Annie|title=Psychology guides and information literacy|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|date=3 June 2014|volume=42|issue=2|pages=293–304|doi=10.1108/RSR-10-2013-0052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
MIT pathfinders in the 1970s had the following format:&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Scope''' - a definition of the subject covered by the pathfinder.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;WARNER, AS 1983, 'Pathfinders: a way to boost your information handouts beyond booklists and bibliographies', ''[[American Libraries]]'', 14, pp. 150-151, Library Literature &amp; Information Science Retrospective: 1905-1983 (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost, viewed 27 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''An introduction to this is in...''' - typically an encyclopedia or [[specialised dictionary]].&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Books''' - alerting readers to relevant [[subject heading|subject terms]].&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Reference Works''' - citations for specific books.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Bibliographies''' - lists of sources which are too long to include in the pathfinder.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Journal Articles''' - referring readers to indexes.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Journals''' - referring readers to journals and magazines to browse that might have some information.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;
*'''Reviews, government sources, etc.''' - other sources as appropriate.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;

Although the format varied, it emphasised subjects that were broad in scope and providing many different types of sources to the reader.  In contrast, some academic libraries created specific pathfinders that functioned as a partial [[bibliography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nuttall|first1=Harry D.|last2=McAbee|first2=Sonja L.|title=Pathfinders On-Line|journal=College &amp; Undergraduate Libraries|date=19 April 1997|volume=4|issue=1|pages=77–96|doi=10.1300/J106v04n01_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, Jim Kapoun argued that key features of good pathfinders were "compactness and basic informational resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kapoun|first1=Jim M.|title=Re-Thinking the Library Pathfinder|journal=College &amp; Undergraduate Libraries|date=21 April 1995|volume=2|issue=1|pages=93–105|doi=10.1300/J106v02n01_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Booklists have been produced by libraries since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Dunsmore/&gt; but the term pathfinder was coined in 1972 by Marie Canfield.&lt;ref name=Vileno2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vileno|first1=Luigina|title=From paper to electronic, the evolution of pathfinders: a review of the literature|journal=Reference Services Review|date=7 August 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–451|doi=10.1108/00907320710774300}}&lt;/ref&gt; From approximately 1973-1975, the Model Library Program sold pathfinders among libraries, but there was not enough interest to continue selling pathfinders, as most libraries preferred to create their own.&lt;ref name=Vileno2007/&gt;

From the mid-1990s, as the Internet became more popular, libraries began including web resources in their pathfinders and putting the pathfinders on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Katherine A.|last2=Gaines|first2=Julie K.|last3=Levy|first3=Linda S.|title=New "Starting Points" for Resources by Subject|journal=Medical Reference Services Quarterly|date=28 January 2009|volume=28|issue=1|pages=88–97|doi=10.1080/02763860802616110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webography|Webliographies]] became popular, lists of web links that were curated by librarians on a topic.  These differed from pathfinders because they did not focus on the library's collection.&lt;ref name=MorrisBosque&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Sara|author2=Bosque, Darcy Del|title=Forgotten Resources: Subject Guides in the era of Web 2.0|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=15 March 2010|volume=27|issue=2|pages=178–193|doi=10.1080/07317130903547592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As library services became increasingly accessible online, options for creating online pathfinders expanded, including webpages, [http://springshare.com/libguides/ LibGuides], and open-source [[content management systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Aaron W. Dobbs |editor2=Ryan L. Sittler |editor3=Douglas Cook |title=Using LibGuides to Enhance Library Services : A LITA Guide|date=2013|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|location=Chicago, [IL]|isbn=9781555708801|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Library clients can use pathfinders at their own pace, and may find them "more approachable" than a [[reference desk]].  Electronic pathfinders on a library website can be used 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name=Vileno2007/&gt;
In higher education, embedding library subject guides into a [[learning management system]] has been shown to increase use of library resources among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowen|first1=Aaron|title=A LibGuides presence in a Blackboard environment|journal=Reference Services Review|date=10 August 2012|volume=40|issue=3|pages=449–468|doi=10.1108/00907321211254698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2011 study found that students often do not use library guides simply by not knowing they exist, or preferring to use a [[search engine]] or a trusted [[bibliographic database]] instead. This study found that students would use the subject guides if they didn't know where to begin, or if they were navigating a new [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] or if their lecturer told them to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouellette|first1=Dana|title=Subject Guides in Academic Libraries: A User-Centred Study of Uses and Perceptions/Les guides par sujets dans les bibliothèques académiques : une étude des utilisations et des perceptions centrée sur l'utilisateur|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science]]|date=2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=436–451|doi=10.1353/ils.2011.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the stated audience for pathfinders are library clients,&lt;ref name=Vileno2007/&gt;  Jackson and Pellack reported that reference librarians regarded them as a useful tool for training and for librarians at the front desk.&lt;ref name="JacksonPellack"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Rebecca|last2=Pellack|first2=Lorraine J.|title=Internet Subject Guides in Academic Libraries: An Analysis of Contents, Practices, and Opinions|journal=[[Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly]]|date=Summer 2004|volume=43|issue=4|pages=319–327|jstor=20864244}} as cited in {{cite journal|last1=Vileno|first1=Luigina|title=From paper to electronic, the evolution of pathfinders: a review of the literature|journal=Reference Services Review|date=7 August 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–451|doi=10.1108/00907320710774300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that creating and maintaining library guides may be considered a [[professional development]] activity for librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagshaw|first1=Anna|last2=Yorke-Barber|first2=Phil|title=Guiding Librarians: Rethinking Library Guides as a Staff Development Tool|journal=[[Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association]]|date=3 December 2017|pages=1–11|doi=10.1080/24750158.2017.1410629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
It has been argued that pathfinders do not take a user-centred approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shipman|first1=Jean P.|last2=Hemmig|first2=William|title=Online pathfinders|journal=Reference Services Review|date=March 2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=66–87|doi=10.1108/00907320510581397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inconsistent formatting and overly-complex language have also been pointed to as being key points to watch out for.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Candice 2001, 'Electronic pathfinders in academic libraries: an analysis of their content and form', ''[[College &amp; Research Libraries]]'', 62, 3, pp. 227-237, Library Literature &amp; Information Science Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost, viewed 27 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students become frustrated with dead links on subject guides, or the omission of resources that they consider essential.  Maintaining and updating pathfinders is considered problematic.  The use of [[Web 2.0]] tools such as [[wiki]]s and [[blog]]s are considered to be helpful in enabling smaller libraries to quickly update their pathfinders.&lt;ref name=MorrisBosque/&gt;  It has also been said that librarians take a compilatory rather than a research attitude to creating a pathfinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hjørland|first1=Birger|title=Domain analysis in information science|journal=[[Journal of Documentation]]|date=August 2002|volume=58|issue=4|pages=422–462|doi=10.1108/00220410210431136}} as cited in {{cite journal|last1=Vileno|first1=Luigina|title=From paper to electronic, the evolution of pathfinders: a review of the literature|journal=Reference Services Review|date=7 August 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–451|doi=10.1108/00907320710774300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little study has been done on how well a pathfinder covers its subject matter.  A study found that pathfinders did not show the [[multi-disciplinary]] nature of [[literary studies]] well.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson, J. (2004), “Electronic subject guides in literary studies: a qualitative content analysis”, unpublished Master of Science in Information Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, available at: https://ils.unc.edu/MSpapers/2996.pdf as cited in {{cite journal|last1=Vileno|first1=Luigina|title=From paper to electronic, the evolution of pathfinders: a review of the literature|journal=Reference Services Review|date=7 August 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–451|doi=10.1108/00907320710774300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackson and Pellack examined similar subject guides at different institutions to find out about duplication of effort in pathfinders.  They found that there was little overlap between subject guides at different institutions, and that some websites used were of questionable quality.  Furthermore, they found that libraries did not typically delete outdated pathfinders, because "something was better than nothing".&lt;ref name="JacksonPellack"/&gt; When pathfinders at the course level are created, it may cause confusion to the students if the teacher also creates their own resources list, or faculty may regard the librarian as overstepping their role.&lt;ref name=Brazzeal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brazzeal|first1=Bradley|title=Research guides as library instruction tools|journal=Reference Services Review|date=July 2006|volume=34|issue=3|pages=358–367|doi=10.1108/00907320610685319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peasant with a Wheelbarrow''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Jean-François Millet]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Begun in 1848 but not finished until Millet found a buyer in 1852, it depicts a peasant man pushing a wheelbarrow.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In ''Peasant with a Wheelbarrow'', Millet took a peasant farmer with simple clothes and tools, and transformed him into a symbol of the dignity of manual labor. The peasant is utterly idealized, bathed in a golden light and transmuted into an emblem of a vanishing way of life.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|date=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Moving to [[Barbizon]] in 1849, Millet quickly became associated with the [[Barbizon School]]. Although he shared their enthusiasm for painting fresh, outdoors scenes, Millet also liked to depict the local farmers. He found the nobility of the peasants, with their lives grounded in the soil, a welcome change from the instability of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magister|first=Senex|title=Jean Francois Millet|url=http://hoocher.com/Jean_Francois_Millet/Jean_Francois_Millet.html|publisher=Pagina Artis|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was brought to its highest prominence by the [[Revolution of 1848]]. The classically trained Millet was making a powerful political statement with this image, which raised a humble rural scene to the same level as a [[history painting]]. This intimate portrait reveals Millet's poetic side. Soon, he would transition to epic canvases for the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Peasant with a Wheelbarrow'' was acquired by the IMA in 1949, a gift of the James E. Roberts Fund and the Alumni Association of the [[Herron School of Art and Design|John Herron Art School]]. It is currently on view in the Norb &amp; Ruth Schaefer, Sr. and Norb &amp; Carolyn Schaefer Jr. Gallery and has the accession number 49.48.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Peasant with a Wheelbarrow|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/peasant-wheelbarrow-millet-jean-fran%C3%A7ois|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of a German Officer''''' is an early 20th century [[portrait]] by American modernist painter [[Marsden Hartley]]. Done in oil on canvas, the portrait depicts the abstract figure of an [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German officer]] as being composed entirely of [[Military awards and decorations|military decorations]] and badges of rank. The painting is currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== Description ==

=== Background ===
''Portrait of a German Officer'' was painted by American painter Marsden Hartley in late 1914 while he was living in the German imperial capital of [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Hartley was greatly effected by the pageantry and discipline of the German army, with this interest eventually manifesting itself in some of his works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/hartley-officer/|title=Marsden Hartley, Portrait of a German Officer - Smarthistory|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hartley-marsden-artworks.htm|title=Marsden Hartley Most Important Art {{!}} TheArtStory|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portrait of a German Officer'' was intended to honor Karl von Freyburg, a German [[lieutenant]] who had died during the first few months of the [[World War I|First World War]]. It has been posited that Hartley's correspondence with Freyburg indicates that the former was romantically interested in the German officer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/488486|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Painting ===
Hartley's painting is highly sequential, symbolic, and heavily influenced by [[cubism]] and the school of [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]]. The black, white, and red flag of the German Empire is placed in a prominent position in the bottom central portion of the image, while the [[Iron Cross]] (a decoration which Freyburg was awarded) is prominently featured in the top-center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The blue and white checkered flag of Freyburg's home state of [[Bavaria]] is also shown, as is an officer's white-striped [[Epaulette|epaulet]]. Hartly also included more personal details in the portrait; the number ''24'' represents Freyburg's age when he died, Freyburg's initials (K.v.F) are seen in gold-on-red, Freyburg's regimental number (4) can be seen in center of the portrait, and a [[spur]] (representing Freyburg's service as a cavalry officer) can be seen in the bottom right of the image. Hartfield also represented Germany's enemies during the war through his inclusion of the [[Saint George's Cross|English Cross of St. George]] and the [[Belgian tricolour|Belgian Tricolor]], both seen at the bottom of the portrait.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Tie-dye.png|thumb|right200px|A swirling psychedelic pattern]]
'''Psychedelic art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist [[Humphry Osmond]]) means "mind manifesting".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".  In common parlance "psychedelic art" refers above all to the art movement of the late [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].  Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock music]].  Concert posters, album covers, [[liquid light shows]], liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

== Features ==
[[File:Liquid Oil Projection.jpg|thumb|A liquid oil projection]]
* Fantastic, metaphysical and surrealistic subject matter
* [[Kaleidoscope|Kaleidoscopic]], [[fractal art|fractal]] or [[paisley (design)|paisley]] patterns
* Bright and/or highly contrasting colors
* Extreme depth of detail or stylization of detail. Also so called [[Horror vacui]] style.
* Morphing of objects or themes and sometimes [[collage]]
* [[Phosphenes]], spirals, concentric circles, [[diffraction]] patterns, and other [[entoptic phenomenon|entoptic]] motifs
* Repetition of [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]
* Innovative typography and hand-lettering, including warping and transposition of positive and negative spaces

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration.  The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration.  Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations.  Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science.  Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud's theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally "turned on" by [[Albert Hofmann]]'s discovery of LSD.

The early examples of "psychedelic art" are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the [[Surrealist art]] movement, such as [[Remedios Varo]] and [[André Masson]]. It should also be noted that these came from writers involved in the Surrealist movement.  [[Antonin Artaud]] writes of his peyote experience in ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara'' (1937).  [[Henri Michaux]] wrote ''[[Misérable Miracle]]'' (1956), to describe his experiments with [[mescaline]] and also [[hashish]].

[[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (1954) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD.  For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research.  Hofmann saw the drug's potential for  poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer [[Ernst Jünger]]'s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist [[Oscar Janiger]].  Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist's choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD.  The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist.  The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture.  Beatnik poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a "complete disorientation of the senses" (to paraphrase [[Arthur Rimbaud]]).  They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine.  LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==
[[File:San Francisco Oracle Cover Vol.1 No.5, January 1967.jpg|thumb|Cover of the San Francisco Oracle, Volume 1 No.5, January 1967.]]
Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The "Fillmore Posters" were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist [[Bridget Riley]] became famous for her op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. [[Mati Klarwein]] created psychedelic masterpieces for [[Miles Davis|Miles Davis']] Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for [[Carlos Santana]] Latin Rock.  [[Pink Floyd]] worked extensively with London-based designers, [[Hipgnosis]] to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Warren Dayton]] and Art Bevacqua and New York artists [[Peter Max]] and [[Milton Glaser]] all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the [[Summer of Love]] focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the [[hippie]] counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion  that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.  The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  "Zap Comix" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], Victor Moscoso, [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.  [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, "The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]", whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself.  LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper.  Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs.  Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max.  A caption explains that each of Max's clocks "transposes time into multi-fantasy colors."&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm's length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''68/69 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1968. pgs. 45, 75, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Campbell's soup ran a poster promotion that promised to "Turn your wall souper-delic!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 798&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The art of peter max.jpg|thumb|The Art Of Peter Max]]

The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pgs. 443, 102, 76, 85, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pgs. 39, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Brian Wells explains, "The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Even the term "psychedelic" itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean "anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pgs. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Puns using the concept of "tripping" abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was "great on trips!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All-American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

==Digital age==

[[File:Juliasetsdkpictfield3.jpg|thumb|Fractal artwork created using the [[Julia set]]]]
[[Computer art]] has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision.  [[Fractal]] generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation.  Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The "digital revolution" was indeed heralded early on as the "New LSD" by none other than [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name="Leary, Horowitz &amp; Marshall 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Timothy Leary|Leary, Timothy]]; Horowitz, Michael; Marshall, Vicky| title = Chaos and Cyber Culture| publisher = Ronin Publishing| year = 1994| isbn = 0-914171-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthofer 1997"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Ruthofer, Arno|title = Think for Yourself; Question Authority|    year = 1997 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html  | accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Deep Dream Toast Sandwich.jpg|thumb|350px|[[DeepDream]] modified toast sandwich]]
The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies.  The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic [[poster art]], but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what [[digital art]] and [[computer graphics]] software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the [[convolutional neural network]] [[DeepDream]] finds and enhance patterns in images purely via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy).  Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and [[aesthetics]], particularly the aesthetics of [[Rave|rave culture]].  But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an [[entactogen]].  Development of new psychedelics such as [[2C-B]] and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]]) are truly psychedelic, and these novel psychedelics are fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist's vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia.  Well-known examples are [[Amanda Sage]], [[Alex Grey]], and [[Robert Venosa]].  These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are "psychedelic", are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization.  While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

'''Public art in Vancouver''' is an important aspect of the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regardingplace.com/?p=4827 re:place Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of [[public art]] are funded by the provincial and federal government. Up to 1% of the budget of a building can go towards the construction of public art.

==The Public Art Program==
Vancouver’s Public Art Program seeks to incorporate contemporary art practices into city planning and development. The program supports art-making of many kinds - emerging and established artists, in new and traditional media from stand-alone commissions to artist collaborations. The program is part of Cultural Services and oversees development of public art opportunities throughout the city. Civic projects at civic buildings, greenways, parks and other public spaces are funded through capital budgets. Private sector projects are funded by developments in the rezoning process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/oca/Publicart/index.htm Public Art program Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]], the Public Art Program has commissioned various local artists to produce works, with projects such as [[Paul Wong (artist)|Paul Wong]]'s ''5'' project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5.paulwongprojects.com/ Paul Wong Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Tombs of the Koryo Dynasty''' are a group of [[tomb]]s of members of the  [[Korea]]n [[Koryo Dynasty]] (918-1392).

==The tombs==
The royal tombs are scattered around southwestern [[North Hwanghae Province]], with most of them located within 20 kilometers of [[Kaesong]], the Koryo capital. Most tombs are located in [[Kaepung]] County, which borders Kaesong to the west, though there are also a significant number in [[Changpung]] county, which borders Kaesong to the east. Some tombs, all unidentified, are also located within Kaesong itself.

Koryo-era royal tombs followed the guidelines outlined in Chinese [[Confucian]] texts, such as the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' (''Li Ji'') and the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' (''Zhou Li''). Many factors went into consideration when deciding the location of a tomb, such as the distance from [[Kaesong]], the distance in relation to other royal tombs, the accessibility of the location, and the tradition of [[Feng Shui]] (known as 'pungsu' in [[Korean Language|Korean]]). The tomb construction also took into account traditional burial rituals of Korea and the natural environment. 

===Hyonrung=== 
[[File:Tomb of Wang Geon - Kaesong07.jpg|thumb|right|Hyonrung - Tomb of King Taejo]]
{{coord|37|59|6|N|126|30|19|E|region:KR_type:landmark|display=inline}}&lt;BR&gt;
'''Hyonrung''' (현릉/{{linktext|顯|陵}}), also known as the '''Tomb of King Wanggon''', is the tomb of King [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]] (877-943, r. 918-943), founder of the Koryo dynasty. Taejo, who adopted that name upon ascending the throne, was the first king to unify the entire Korean peninsula after subjugation the southern states of [[Silla]] and [[Paekje]]. Construction on the tomb began after the king's death in 943. He was buried with his favorite wife, Queen Sinhye.
The tomb was heavily reconstructed in 1994, and all of the original buildings and statues were cleared away in order to accomplish its "restoration". Today, the burial chamber is open to tourists, and displays the coffins containing the remains of Taejo and his queen, as well as the tomb's original carved decorations.
Hyonrung is located on the side of Mt. Mansu in Haeson-ri, Kaepung County, and is listed as [[National Treasures of North Korea|North Korean National Treasure #179]]. In the valley behind the tomb is the [[Chilrunggun]], a group of seven tombs containing the remains of various princes, princesses, and concubines.

{{coord|37|58|55|N|126|28|23|E|region:KR_type:landmark|display=inline}}&lt;BR&gt;
'''Hyonjongrung''' (현정릉/{{linktext|玄|正|陵}}), better known as the '''Tomb of King Kongmin''' is the burial place of King [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Kongmin]] (1330-1374, r. 1351-1374), 31st monarch of the Koryo dynasty, and his wife, the [[Mongolian people|Mongolian]] princess Noguk. It is the best-preserved of the Koryo dynasty royal tombs, and a popular tourist site. Construction on the tombs began after Queen Noguk's death in 1365, and was completed seven years later in 1372. The tombs consist of a carved granite base topped with a small hill; they are surrounded by statues of sheep and tigers, representing the nations of Korea and Mongolia respectively. The "spirit road" up to the tombs is lined with statues of military officers and Confucian officials. Their placement was an important consideration for the king, and many geomancers, astrologers, and mathematicians were consulted to make sure the site had good feng shui. Unfortunately,the tomb's relics were lost in 1905 when the tomb chamber was blasted open with dynamite and looted by the Japanese; most of the relics inside were believed to be taken to [[Japan]], though Kongmin's coffin is exhibited in the [[Koryo Museum]] in Kaesong.
The tomb is located in Haeson-ri, Kaepung County, and is listed as [[National Treasures of North Korea|North Korean National Treasure #123]].

The '''Great Seal of the State of Iowa''' was created in 1847 (one year after [[Iowa]] became a [[U.S. state]]) and depicts a citizen soldier standing in a wheat field surrounded by symbols including farming, mining, and transportation with the [[Mississippi River]] in the background. An eagle overhead bears the state motto.

==Definition==
The Seal of Iowa is described carefully under Iowa Code 1A.1 in the following: "''The secretary of state be, and is, hereby authorized to procure a seal which shall be the great seal of the state of Iowa, two inches in diameter, upon which shall be engraved the following device, surrounded by the words, 'The Great Seal of the State of Iowa' - a sheaf and field of standing [[wheat]], with a sickle and other farming utensils, on the left side near the bottom; a [[Lead (metal)|lead]] furnace and pile of pig lead on the right side; the citizen soldier, with a [[plow]] in his rear, supporting the [[American flag]] and [[Phrygian cap|liberty cap]] with his right hand, and his gun with his left, in the center and near the bottom; the [[Mississippi River]] in the rear of the whole, with the [[Iowa (steamboat)|steamer Iowa]] under way; an [[Bald eagle|eagle]] near the upper edge, holding in his beak a scroll, with the following inscription upon it: Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.''"

[[File:Seal of iowa over time.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Historically there were numerous variations of the Seal of Iowa. ''The Reports of the Iowa Geological Survey'', for example, used three different seals 1893-1918.]]

It was approved by the First [[Iowa General Assembly]] on February 25, 1847. Since that date, there have been no revisions to the code governing this Seal. The Seal of Iowa is kept and used by the [[Governor of Iowa|Governor]] for official purposes. Because the seal was not illustrated in the Iowa code, over the years there have been several variations with differences in color and arrangement of objects.

The seal was not universally beloved when introduced, it was considered cluttered and ungainly, and the older Territorial Seal was utilized in several instances on official publications into the 1860s, including official currency. "[[Ralph P. Lowe|Gov. Lowe]], who, with every other gentleman of refinement, cannot but regret the bad taste that conceived and adopted the conglomerate devices of our present 'Great Seal'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvin|first=T.|title=Territorial Sea of Iowa|journal=Annals of Iowa|date=April 1864|pages=264–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steamboat Iowa Barber 1865p506 cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Iowa (steamboat)|Steamboat Iowa]]'' chuffing up the Mississippi through [[Dubuque, Iowa]], ca. 1865.]]
The symbols presented on the seal reflect things important to early Iowa settlers.

*'''Citizen soldier.''' The seal was approved during the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848, and the citizen soldier depicted with a "liberty cap" represents volunteer soldiers from Iowa. Battles of the Mexican-American war are also memorialized in several place names, including the counties of [[Buena Vista County, Iowa|Buena Vista]], [[Palo Alto County, Iowa|Palo Alto]] and [[Cerro Gordo County, Iowa|Cerro Gordo]]. As is traditional in official symbols, weapons are held in the soldier's left hand, and items of peace and freedom in the right.
* '''Liberty Cap.''' A "liberty cap", also called a [[Phrygian cap]], is a brimless hat resembling a tall beret that is an ancient Greek symbol of freedom. However, the soldier on the seal typically wears a wide-brimmed hat that resembles a Civil War-era Cavalry hat. Most versions of the seal put the liberty cap on top of the flag staff, presumably because the artists felt the cap did not match the soldier's uniform, which typically resembles that of a Civil War Union soldier.
*'''Wheat.''' Early settlers in the 1840s primarily planted wheat, it was not until the introduction of the railroad in the 1850s and 1860s that [[maize|corn]] became the primary crop of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon. ''Nature's Metropolis'' 1991. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lead mining Barber 1865p321cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Lead mining near Dubuque, 1865, showing a mine, furnace, and slag.]]
*'''Lead.''' Lead mining in the [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] region was an early economic force; no lead is mined in Iowa today.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Geological and Water Survey, {{cite web |url=http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/leadzinc/leadzinc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170226/http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/leadzinc/leadzinc.htm |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "pig" is a large slab of lead shaped in a furnace mold with four corners that protrude slightly to facilitate handling; thought to resemble the animal [[pig]].
*'''Steamer Iowa.''' The ''[[Iowa (steamboat)|Steamboat Iowa]]'' was revered as one of the largest and fastest boats on the Mississippi; it set the speed record from [[Galena, Illinois]] to [[St. Louis]] in 1843, making the trip in 44 hours, a record that held until 1849.&lt;ref&gt;p. 241, ''Steamboating on the Upper Mississippi'', William J. Peterson, 1968, [[State Historical Society of Iowa]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi was the primary route of transportation in Iowa in the 1840s, and most large Iowa towns were on or near the Mississippi.
*'''Eagle.''' The federal eagle was used in the earlier Seal of the Iowa Territory, and this symbol holding a banner with the motto of Iowa on it was incorporated into the [[flag of Iowa]].

=="Plow in his rear" controversy==
Concerned about portraying members of the [[Iowa National Guard]] in a poor light, in 2010 Rep. Ray Zirkelbach, a state legislator, recommended changing the text "the citizen soldier, with a plow in his rear" to "the citizen soldier, standing in front of a plow” because "in his rear" is considered a [[malapropism]]. His proposal was not considered in 2010 because of time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Legislator: Remove 'rear' from state seal wording ''Des Moines Register'' January 14, 2010 http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20101140355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iowa territorial seal==
The state seal supplanted the [[Iowa Territory]] seal (1838–1846), which consisted of a Federal eagle holding an arrow in its mouth and a bow in its talon. "The Seal of Iowa contains the following simple device: An Eagle In the attitude of flight grasping in its dexter talon a Bow and holding in its beak an arrow. Around the border of the seal are the words, SEAL OF THE TERRITORY OF IOWA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Marcius|title=American history: comprising historical sketches of the Indian tribes|publisher=Moore and Co.|location=New York|year=1847|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial seal was the basis for other state seals, including the first seal of the [[University of Iowa]] and the [[State Historical Society of Iowa]], as well as the Civil War Arms of Iowa; these later seals had the bow held in the left talon, rather than the right.

The Territorial seal was well liked as a simple image of the state and was used on state documents well into the 1860s, even after it had been officially replaced. "It is regarded as perfectly expressive of a distinct idea, intimately associated with the history of the delightful country which we have the happiness to inhabit... The slightest examination of the seal will disclose to the Honorable Council the eagle, the proud and appropriate emblem of our national power, bearing in its beak an Indian arrow, and clutching in its talons an unstrung bow; and while the idea thus delicately evolved is so well calculated to make the eye glisten with patriotic pride, and cause the heart to beat high with the pulsations of conscious superiority, it nevertheless presents a touching appeal to our manly sensibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvin|first=T.|title=Territorial Sea of Iowa|journal=Annals of Iowa|date=April 1864|pages=264–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=September 2012}}
'''''Strickland v. Sony''''' was a court case whose central focus was on whether violent video games played a role in Devin Moore's [[murder|first-degree murder/shooting]] of three people in a police station. In August 2005, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]] filed the lawsuit against [[Sony]].

==History==
Devin Moore was convicted in 2005 for the 2003 shooting of two police officers and a dispatcher as he was being detained for allegedly stealing a car. He grabbed one officer's .45 caliber pistol and killed all three before fleeing the station in a police cruiser he stole from the station. He was eventually caught and sentenced to death by lethal injection.

In March 2005, Thompson announced he was filing a lawsuit on behalf of the families of two of the three victims in [[Fayette, Alabama]]. He was also featured in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' special on the case.&lt;ref name="60minutes"&gt;Bradley, Ed. "[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/04/60minutes/main678261.shtml Can A Video Game Lead To Murder?]". ''[[60 Minutes]]'', 2006-03-05&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2007, the third victim's family later joined the lawsuit.

On November 1, 2005, Thompson sent an email to various websites commenting on the opening day of the civil trial. In it, he compared [[Sony]] and [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s sale of the ''Grand Theft Auto'' video game to [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] during [[World War II]]. According to Thompson, certain [[regional government]]s in Japan had prevented the sale of the ''Grand Theft Auto'' games to minors, though Sony continued to sell the game where its sale was not restricted in Japan and abroad ([[Microsoft]] is doing the same for its own video game console). Thompson also compared the distribution of violent games to the distribution of pornography.&lt;ref name="Pearl Harbor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/game-lawyer-compares-sony-pearl-harbor |title=Game Lawyer Compares Sony to 'Pearl Harbor' - Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2011-06-16 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2005, [[Blank Rome]] submitted a motion to have Thompson removed from the case, stating that Thompson would "turn the courtroom into a circus."&lt;ref name="standing"&gt;DeWitt, Robert. [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051104/NEWS/511040354/1007 Lawyer pushes to have standing in video game lawsuit]. ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'', 2005-11-04&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2005, Thompson withdrew from the case, stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore; however, Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his right to practice law in Alabama ''(using [[Pro hac vice|Pro Hac Vice]])'', following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/126359.html |title=gamepolitics: BREAKING NEWS: GTA Lawsuit Will Proceed Minus Jack Thompson |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bow"&gt;DeWitt, Robert. "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051108/NEWS/511080361/1007 Attorney in Fayette case bows out]" ''Tuscaloosa News'' 2005-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before leaving the case, Thompson filed a motion with the court, quoting noted designer [[Warren Spector]] (''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', ''[[Thief (computer game series)|Thief]]'') as being critical of Rockstar's actions, taken from a speech Spector gave at the [[Montreal]] International Game Summit. He even implied that Spector could be served a [[subpoena]] to testify, even though the court's jurisdiction did not extend to Spector's place of residence. On November 9, 2005, Spector lashed out at Thompson for taking his comments out of context, saying "Take two or three things, from different contexts, mash them together and you can mislead people pretty dramatically." &lt;ref name="clarification"&gt;Feldman, Curt. "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6139443.html Warren Spector clarifies GTA critique]". ''[[GameSpot]]'', 2005-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devin Moore ===
{{main|Devin Moore}}

Devin Moore was apprehended several hours after the shootings in Mississippi. According to the [[Associated Press]], after his recapture he said, "Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime." Once in custody, Moore quickly confessed. He told detectives that he shot the men because he didn't want to go to jail.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. ''True Stories of Law &amp; Order: SVU''. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 139. ({{ISBN|0425217353}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore faced trial in 2005 and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Tony |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/11/gta_not_guilty/ |title='Grand Theft Auto' cop killer found guilty |publisher=The Register |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge barred the defense from introducing evidence to the jury that ''Grand Theft Auto'' incited Moore's shooting spree. Moore's attorney, Jim Standridge, contended that Moore was suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] at the time of the crimes. Standridge argued that Moore had been emotionally and physically abused by his father as a child.&lt;ref&gt;'Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. ''True Stories of Law &amp; Order: SVU''. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 139. ({{ISBN|0425217353}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged. On October 9, 2005, he was sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]]. Jim Standridge appealed the case. On February 17, 2012, the [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld Moore's conviction in a 5-0 decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beyerle |first=Dana |url=http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20120217/news/120219821 |title='Grand Theft Auto' killer's sentence upheld |publisher=The Gadsden Times |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case will automatically be appealed to the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], and can then be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

==Alabama license revoked==
On November 18, 2005, Judge Moore rejected Thompson's request to withdraw, and instead revoked his ''[[Pro hac vice|Pro Hac Vice]]'' admission (a temporary license to practice in a given jurisdiction), in an 18-page decision. Thompson responded with a letter to [[Alabama]]'s Judicial Inquiry Commission, questioning Judge Moore's ethics and accusing him of violating the first 3 [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050529061436/http://www.alalinc.net/jic/docs/cans2000.pdf Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/134653.html |title=gamepolitics: BREAKING: Jack Thompson Thrown off Alabama Case by Judge |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toss"&gt;Sinclair, Brendan. [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140117.html Alabama judge tosses Thompson]. GameSpot, 2005-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also claimed the judge had "absolutely no authority" in preventing him from withdrawing from the case, and so therefore the court's decision to kick him off the case was a "legal nullity". He accused the court of punishing him for "aggressively telling the truth" while it "looked the other way when [[Blank Rome]] elegantly told those lies."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;Feldman, Curt. [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140202.html Jack Thompson huffs, puffs, provokes]. GameSpot, 2005-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Moore has also referred this matter to the [[Alabama State Bar]] for "appropriate action" remarking among other things: "Mr. Thompson's actions before this Court suggest that he is unable to conduct himself in a manner befitting practice in this state." &lt;ref name="revoke"&gt;Steel, Wade. [http://ps2.ign.com/articles/668/668345p1.html Jack Thompson's Alabama License Revoked]. [[IGN]], 2005-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2005, Thompson claimed that "We had heard going into this civil case, before it was even filed, that a particular Western Alabama lawyer had to be part of our litigation team or Judge Moore would not give us a fair hearing. This lawyer himself claims, openly, that 'Judge Moore will not allow you to survive summary judgment if I am not on the case.' For too long we have heard swirling around this Judge allegations of improper influence." (sic) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/137095.html |title=gamepolitics: Jack Thompson vs. The World, Alphabetically |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson alluded that the "fixer" was local lawyer Clatus Junkin, although Junkin denied he had any influence over any judges, or that he had made such a comment, as he was "not that dumb [...] or foolish enough to imply that [he] could [influence Judge Moore]." He also declined Thompson's request to join the plaintiffs' team, citing disagreements over Thompson's demands of complete control of any contact with the news media. Judge Moore noted that even though he had banned comments on the case outside the courtroom, Thompson had issued 7 different communications between the start of the case and the day he revoked Thompson's ''Pro Hac Vice''.&lt;ref name=thompsonRevoked&gt;DeWitt, Robert "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS/511220348/1007 Judge stands by Fayette decision]". ''Tuscaloosa News'', November 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After being thrown off the case, Thompson requested that Judge Moore [[recuse]] himself from the case. Moore ignored him, stating "I can’t consider it because he’s no longer practicing in the state of Alabama. If some other lawyer in the case asks me to recuse myself, I’ll consider it in court."&lt;ref name="recusal request"&gt;DeWitt, Robert [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/NEWS/512060349&amp;SearchID=73243282680461 Fayette judge will hear video game case]. ''Tuscaloosa News'', 2005-12-06; accessed 2006-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2005, Thompson announced that he will be "assisting plaintiffs’ counsel during the discovery process and in the courtroom at trial" when the civil trial begins in 2006 (the judge ruled on both Thompson's dismissal from the case, and dismissal of the case itself, during pretrial hearings). He also claimed he "will likely be a witness in the case." Although he gave no details as to what he would be a witness to, except that he claimed he had "warned, in writing," Take-Two and Rockstar Games "that murders such as those in Alabama would occur by teens who had rehearsed the murders on their virtual reality killing simulators." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/157172.html?thread=8478452#t8478452 |title=gamepolitics: Hot Coffee Scandal Named to List of Worst P.R. Blunders |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted though, that Judge Moore forbade Thompson from "[communicating] with the court or the judge" or he "would be held in contempt of court." &lt;ref name=thompsonDenied&gt;DeWitt, Robert "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051119/NEWS/511190331/1007 Judge denies attorney’s request to withdraw from Devin Moore case]". ''Tuscaloosa News'', November 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While that order was appealed, it has not yet{{when|date=August 2015}} been ruled on.

On February 16, 2006, Thompson sent a letter to the Alabama Bar, accusing Judge Moore of breaking the bar rules by publicly disclosing that he had filed a complaint about Thompson with the Alabama Bar. He accused Judge Moore of denying Devin Moore a fair trial, and claimed the FBI was investigating the Florida Bar's "disciplinary process". Thompson gave the Alabama Bar until "five o’clock p.m., Eastern time, February 17, 2006" to drop the complaint, or else he would file a "federal lawsuit in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida on Monday, February 20, 2006." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/208673.html?thread=14563617#t14563617 |title=gamepolitics: GameCloud Interview with Creator of Jack Thompson-inspired Game |publisher=Gamepolitics.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alabama State Bar rules state that a court official who revokes Pro Hac Vice due to conduct must refer the matter to the Bar for review, and the Bar decides if an investigation is needed. No complaint is required to open an investigation.

Thompson's deadline of February 17 passed, without action from either party.

On February 22, 2006, Thompson followed up with another letter, announcing that he had filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar, for investigating a complaint " which in fact was not even filed" in "violation of its own Bar Rules." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/213925.html?thread=15262117#t15262117 |title=gamepolitics: Walsh &amp; NIMF Issue Parental Alert For Movie Promo Sex Game |publisher=Gamepolitics.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alabama Bar has not yet been served notice with any complaint from Thompson, nor has any Florida court acknowledged a civil suit being filed.

Thompson announced that the ''Strickland v. Sony'' plaintiffs were still his clients, and vowed to represent them in-court when the trial resumes.&lt;ref name=thompsonVowsReturn&gt;Feldman, Curt  "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6146882.html GTA killer case clears hurdle]". ''GameSpot'', March 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2007, Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The case has been assigned to the same judge who has had previously presided over attempts by Thompson to sue the Florida Bar, which were voluntarily withdrawn. Thompson claimed that his rights of "speech, petition, and religion" were violated when his ''Pro Hac Vice'' status was revoked.

==Dismissal appeal denied==
On March 29, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore's ruling against the dismissal of the case. Law firm Blank-Rome, representing the defendants, had previously attempted unsuccessfully to have the suit dismissed during the pre-trial since it argued that the defendants had a right under the 1st Amendment to sell mature games to minors. At the time of the sale, there was no law preventing such a sale. Thompson called the ruling "exciting" because "no one has ever before survived a motion to dismiss." At the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments as to whether the Fayette County Court had the jurisdiction to preside over the case at all.&lt;ref name=dismissalUpheld&gt;Reeves, Jay "[http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-20/1143662355218050.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews Court rejects appeal in Alabama suit blaming game for slayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029012618/http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-20%2F1143662355218050.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews |date=2008-10-29 }}".

'''Wood carving in the [[Marquesas Islands]]''' is a practice undertaken by many of the local master craftsmen, who are known as ''tuhuna''. The ''tuhuna'' are not only adept at wood carving, but are also skilled at tattoo art and adze manufacture.&lt;ref name="PeregrineEmber2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peregrine|first1=Peter N.|last2=Ember|first2=Melvin|title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 3: East Asia and Oceania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xu_Q0WGdw7YC&amp;pg=PA247|date=31 January 2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46257-3|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marquesan wooden crafts are considered among the finest in [[French Polynesia]]; they are highly sought after,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pacific Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqm6AAAAIAAJ|year=2005|publisher=PacificBasin Communications|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of consistently high quality,&lt;ref name="Brillat1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brillat|first=Michael|title=South Pacific Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-TZYTj3rSkC&amp;pg=PA208|year=1999|publisher=Nelles|isbn=978-3-88618-104-9|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; although weaving, basket-making, and [[pareu painting]] is more popular, especially among women artisans.&lt;ref name="Stanley2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=David|title=Moon Tahiti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKh44TL5dbMC&amp;pg=PT426|date=5 April 2011|publisher=Avalon Travel|isbn=1-61238-114-6|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Gauguin]] noted the artistic sense of decoration of the Marquesas and appreciated the "unheard of sense of decoration" in their creative art forms.{{Sfn|Kjellgren|Ivory|2005|p=3}}

==History==
Wooden figures from Marquesan prehistory can reveal much about the early practices of the local peoples. The popularity of Marquesaan wood carving was due to its increasing demand in foreign countries. This was also a consequence of the introduction of imported metal carving tools in the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Kjellgren|Ivory|2005|p=4}} As a result, new styles emerged in wood carving such as decorating the full surface of an artifact with low-relief designs which had similarities to tattoo designs. This was done to meet the growing demand for souvenirs in the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Kjellgren|Ivory|2005|p=35}}

==Wood cultivation==
Material used to make artifacts includes [[Oceania rosewood]] (''Miro'' or ''Mi'o''), [[oceania walnut]] (''tou''), [[iron wood]] (''aito''), the [[coconut tree]] (''tumu ha'ari'' or ''tumu'ehi'') as well as Pacific rosewood (''[[Thespesia populnea]]'') and ''temana'' (''[[Calophyllum inophyllum]]''); iron wood (''[[Casuarina equisetifolia]]'') is used to carve war clubs and other artifacts.&lt;ref name="Hinanui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinanui-artpolynesien.com/en/content/8-marquesan-handicraft|title=Marquesan Handicraft|publisher=Hinanui-artpolynesien.com|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Kjellgren|Ivory|2005|p=116}} Sandalwood was cleared out of the Marquesas between 1814 and 1817.{{sfn|Dodge|1976|p=60}} It is important to the Marquesan people to use wood from the islands, because of its quality and it follows the tradition of their ancestors. Typically, the wood is dried for up for 10 years, and then treated against pests. While some craftsmen cultivate trees in their own gardens for their wood products, they also purchase it from vendors who grow it in the valleys.&lt;ref name="Hinanui"/&gt;

In 1961, the ''Anthropological Papers'' of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] documented that "the number of Historic period wooden figures collected in the Marquesas attests to the amount of wood carving for monumental purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jm0LAAAAIAAJ|year=1961|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ua Huka]] is particularly well known in the area for its wood carvings. Common objects include sculptural representations of [[Polynesian mythology|Polynesian gods]], humans and animals, and utilitarian items such as decorated bowls, paddles, and clubs.{{sfn|Handy|1922|p=19}} [[Toewood]] and [[rosewood]] are featured in the wood carvings from [[Nuku Hiva]], with bowls and spears made from the former, while tables and chessboards are carved from the latter.{{sfn|Cruising World|1989|p=20}} The ''[[tiki]]'' figurine, "an anthropomorphic figure portrayed with huge oval eyes, arching brows and open  mouth", is typical of the Marquesan arts.&lt;ref name="PeregrineEmber2001"/&gt; Though tikis are most common as stone statues, they are also familiar motifs in wood carving and tattoos in the islands. Patterns used for both wood carving and body decorating have been noted, such as the ''honu kea'' ([[woodlouse]]), ''mata hoata'' (brilliant eye), ''ka'ake'' ([[underarm]] curve), ''poka'a'' ([[wood block]]), and ''enata'' (man).{{sfn|Handy|1922|p=19}}
