==History==
Founded in 1991, the American University in Bulgaria is the first American-style, liberal arts undergraduate education institution in Eastern Europe. The university is a cooperative venture established with the support of the U.S. and Bulgarian governments, the Open Society Institute, the City of Blagoevgrad, and the University of Maine.
When it opened its doors in September 1991, AUBG welcomed a first-year class of 208 students and 16 full-time faculty members. Nowadays, around 1100 students from over 40 countries live and study in AUBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG History |url=https://www.aubg.edu/quick-facts|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2018, twenty-three classes of around 5,000 students had graduated from AUBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Alumni |url=https://www.aubg.edu/news/aubg-salutes-class-of-2017-at-the-23rd-commencement-ceremony-1272|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The AUBG mission is "to educate students of outstanding potential in a community of academic excellence, diversity, and respect and to prepare them for democratic and ethical leadership in serving the needs of the region and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Mission|url=http://www.aubg.edu/mission-values|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university fulfills its mission by providing scholarships and financial aid to deserving students from the region and beyond.

The university has three sources of funding: its endowment (which came largely from gifts from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[Soros Foundation]]), gifts, and tuition. Friends from all over the world, among them, John Dimitry Panitza, Anna Tchaprachikoff, Minko Balkanski, Atanas Zamphiroff, the America for Bulgaria Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=America for Bulgaria Foundation |url=http://www.us4bg.org/|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; have supported the university throughout the years.

==Accreditation==
Baccalaureate degrees conferred by AUBG are accredited in both Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neaa.government.bg/ |title=Republic Of Bulgaria - Council Of Ministers National Evaluation And Accreditation Agency |publisher=Neaa.government.bg |date= |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.

The system compiles information and data on more than 100 indicators, which measure different aspects of university activities. These include: teaching and learning, university environment, welfare and administrative services, science and research, prestige, career development, relevance to the labor market and regional engagement. The indicators are based on statistical data collected from various sources, including sociological surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsvu.mon.bg/rsvu3/ |title=Министерство на образованието и науката: Рейтингова система на висшите училища в България |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bauer's Lexicon'''''&lt;!--book title abbreviations are capitalized--&gt; (also '''''Bauer Lexicon''''' and '''''Bauer's Greek Lexicon''''') is among the most highly respected dictionaries of [[Biblical Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Rykle Borger, "Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Wörterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis," Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Taylor (et al., eds.), pp. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the German forerunner are Erwin Preuschen and [[Walter Bauer]]. The English edition is '''''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature''''' (the 3rd edition was published in 2001 by the [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0226039331}}).

== History ==
The origin may be traced to Erwin Preuschen's ''Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1515/zatw.1908.28.4.U | title =  Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur |trans-title= Full Greek-German Concise Dictionary of the New Testament writings and other early Christian literature| journal = Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft [Journal of Old Testament Studies] | first = D. E.| last= Preuschen| language = German| volume = 28 | issue = 4 | year = 1908 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bauer extensively revised this work, as ''Griechisch-deutsches Wörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur''. 

In the fall of 1949, [[F. Wilbur Gingrich]] was granted a leave of absence from [[Albright College]] to work on a new Greek-English lexicon of the [[New Testament]], translating and adapting the work of [[Walter Bauer]]’s Greek-German lexicon (Bauer lexicon) in collaboration with Dr. William F. Arndt. The work actually took 5 ½ years.

The fourth German edition (1949–52) was translated to English by William F. Arndt and F. Wilbur Gingrich in 1957. Arndt died that same year, to be replaced by [[Frederick William Danker]], with whom Gingrich prepared the second English edition published in 1979.

A sixth German edition was published following Bauer's death in 1960, by [[Kurt Aland]], Barbara Aland and Viktor Reichmann. Gingrich died in 1993, leaving Danker to complete the 3rd English edition based on all the prior editions and substantial work of his own.

The second edition, '''''Bauer-Danker Greek Lexicon of the New Testament''''', was commonly known as '''''BAGD''''' ('''''Bauer–Arndt–Gingrich–Danker'''''). Danker published the third English edition in 2000. Given the extensive improvements in this edition (said to include over 15,000 new citations), it is now known as '''''Bauer–Danker–Arndt–Gingrich''''' ('''''BDAG''''') or sometimes the '''''Bauer-Danker Lexicon'''''.

A notable feature of the third English edition is vastly improved typography. This reflects early adoption of [[SGML]] technology. The entire lexicon was converted to SGML in the late 1980s at [[Dallas Seminary]] with collaboration from SGML experts interested in the project, and Danker actually did substantial editorial and authorial work in an SGML editing program. This technology permitted much more consistent and flexible typography, as well as information retrieval.

A Chinese translation of the lexicon, based on the third English edition, was published in 2009 in Hong Kong by Chinese Bible International Limited.

'''''Beyond This Horizon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. It was originally published as a two-part serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by [[Fantasy Press]] in 1948. It was awarded a [[Retro Hugo]] award for best novel in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo43"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/ |title=1943 Retro Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The novel depicts a world where genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified '[[control group|control naturals]]' are a carefully managed and protected minority. [[Duel]]ing and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic [[utopia]]; the "economic dividend" is so high that [[Post scarcity|work has become optional]]. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.

The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal [[superman|übermensch]]. Felix is the penultimate step in a "star line" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks [[eidetic memory]], which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an "encyclopedic synthesist", one who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life—and the society he lives in—to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of these synthesists seeks him out, inquiring when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure which not only gives him purpose but convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.

Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix is the product of generations of [[genetic engineering]]. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book his genetically engineered son is born. The son is the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] characterized ''Beyond This Horizon'' as among "the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1951, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] reviewed the novel favorably, saying "in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', February 1949, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Japanese visual novel ''[[Eden*]]'', the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|''Beyond This Horizon'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the "Anson McDonald" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]

A '''biosurvey,''' or biological survey, is a scientific study of [[organism]]s to assess the condition of an [[ecological]] resource, such as a [[water body]].

==Overview==
Biosurveys are used by government agencies responsible for management of public lands, environmental planning and/or environmental [[regulation]] to assess ecological resources, such as [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s and [[wetland]]s. They involve collection and analysis of animal and/or plant samples which serve as [[bioindicator]]s. The studies may be conducted by professional scientists or volunteer organizations.  They are conducted according to published procedures to ensure consistency in data collection and analysis, and to compare findings to established metrics.

Biosurveys typically use metrics such as [[species]] composition and richness (e.g. number of species, extent of pollution-tolerant species), and ecological factors (number of individuals, proportion of [[predator]]s, presence of disease). Biosurveys may identify [[water pollution|pollution]] problems that are difficult or expensive to detect using [[water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biosurvey may be used to generate an [[index of biological integrity]] (IBI), a scoring system for an ecological resource.&lt;ref name="Karr"/&gt;

'''Calligraphic projection''' is a system, often used for [[laser lighting display]]s, whereby one or more [[laser]] beams draws an image on a screen by reflecting the laser beam from one or more mirrors attached to a deflecting mechanism.

Analog [[oscilloscope]]s have customarily employed this kind of [[vector graphics]], as did a number of [[computer graphics]] terminals in the 1970s, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]].

Calligraphic projection is sometimes called [[Jules Antoine Lissajous|Lissajous]] projection, after the mathematical figure (and mathematician).

The Texas Children’s Hospital is home to the Center’s Translational Research Labs and [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] (GMP) Laboratories. The Center for Cell and Gene Therapy has the largest academic GMP facility in the world, with 8,600 square feet of Class 10,000 (ISO7) [[cleanroom]] space. The GMP Gene Vector Lab produces clinical grade vectors for use in Phase I/II trials, while the GMP Clinical Research Lab prepares patient components for clinical trials. The Gene Vector Lab was one of only three National Gene Vector Laboratories until that entity was replaced by the National Gene Vector Biorepository in 2008. The Research Lab is a member of the Production Assistance for Cell Therapies (PACT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pactgroup.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stem Cell Transplantation Program has two units. The pediatric unit has more than 16,000 square feet on the eighth floor of Texas Children’s Hospital’s West Tower. The 30,000-square foot adult unit is in The Methodist Hospital’s Main Tower.

{{Chaos magic}}'''Chaos magic''', also spelled '''chaos magick''', is a contemporary [[Magick (paranormal)#Modern_Western_occultism|magical practice]]. It was initially developed in [[England]] in the 1970s, drawing heavily from the philosophy of [[artist]] and [[occultist]] [[Austin Osman Spare]].&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book |last=Chryssides |first=George D. |author-link=George Chryssides |title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition=2 |page=78 |isbn=978-0-8108-6194-7 |ref=refChryssides}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as "success magic" or "results-based magic", chaos magic claims to emphasize the attainment of specific results over the [[symbol]]ic, [[Ritual|ritualistic]], [[Theology|theological]] or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions.&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult |last=Drury |first=Nevill |author-link=Nevill Drury |publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers| year=2011 |orig-year=2002 |isbn=9781780283623 |url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bmg8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |page=86 |ref = refDrury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos magic has been described as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied [[postmodernism]]&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements |last=Clarke |first=Peter |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |publisher=Routledge  |pages=105–106 |isbn=9781134499700 |ref = refClarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or [[Epistemology|knowability]] of objective truth.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt; Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and frequently borrowing from other [[Magick (paranormal)#20th century|magical traditions]], [[religious movements]], [[popular culture]] and various strands of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; 

Early leading figures include [[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]].&lt;ref name=Drury/&gt;

==Concept and terminology==

Chaos magic differs from other occult traditions such as [[Thelema]] or [[Wicca]] in that it rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the ''belief'' of the practitioner.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1987| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oHY_FdJD6kkC| ref = refCarroll2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic thus takes an explicitly agnostic position on whether or not magic exists as a supernatural force, with many chaos magicians expressing their acceptance of a psychological model as one possible explanation.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown when the term "chaos magic" first emerged, with the earliest texts on the subject referring only to "magic" or "the magical art" in general. Furthermore, they often claimed to state principles universal to magic, as opposed to a new specific style or tradition, describing their innovations as efforts to rid magic of superstitious and religious ideas.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}
&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Results| author = Sherwin, Ray| publisher = Revelations 23 Press| year = 1992| isbn = 9781874171003| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zmIiMQAACAAJ| ref = refSherwin1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''chaos'' was first used in connection with magic by Peter J. Carroll in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978), where it is described as "the 'thing' responsible for the origin and continued action of events."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; Carroll goes on to say that "It could as well be called '[[God]]' or '[[Tao]]', but the name 'Chaos' is virtually meaningless and free from the [[anthropomorphic]] ideas of [[religion]]."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

== Beliefs and general principles ==

[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|The Sigil of Chaos, a commonly used symbol of chaos magic]]

=== Results-based magic ===

Other magical traditions like [[Wicca]], [[Qabalah]] or the [[Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|Golden Dawn system]] combine techniques for bringing about change with "beliefs, attitudes, a conceptual model of the universe (if not several), a moral ethic, and a few other things besides."&lt;ref name=Hine1&gt;{{cite book | title = Condensed Chaos: An Introduction to Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150664| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Condensed_Chaos.html?id=_eKuSQAACAAJ| ref = refHine1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic grew out of the desire to strip away all of these extraneous elements, leaving behind only the techniques for effecting change; hence the emphasis is on actually ''doing'' things – i.e., experimenting with different techniques, rather than memorising complex rules, symbols and correspondences – and then retaining those techniques that appear to produce results.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=White1&gt;{{cite book | title = Pieces of Eight: Chaos Magic Essays and Enchantments| author = White, Gordon | year = 2016| ref = refWhite1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "pick'n'mix/D.I.Y" approach means that the working practices of different chaos magicians often look drastically different, with many authors explicitly encouraging readers to invent their own magical style.&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fries1&gt;{{cite book | title = Seidways| author = Fries, Jan | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 1997| isbn = 1-869928-36-9| ref = refFries1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1&gt;{{cite book | title = Understanding Chaos Magic| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Capall Bann Publishing| year = 1996| isbn = 1-898307-93-8| ref = refHawkins1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belief as a tool ===

The central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the "meta-belief" that "belief is a tool for achieving effects".&lt;ref name=Carroll1&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Kaos| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1992| isbn = 9780877287421| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M_GRhTdT4YgC| ref = refCarroll1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like [[Qabalah]], the [[Enochian|Enochian system]], [[astrology]] or the [[I Ching]] are treated as maps or "symbolic and linguistic constructs" that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no [[Universality_(philosophy)|absolute]] or [[Objectivity_(philosophy)|objective truth]] value in themselves&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a position referred to by religious scholar [[Hugh Urban]] as a "rejection of all fixed models of reality",&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Urban |year=2006 |title=Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wVBx9yriTUC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=240–243 |isbn=9780520932883 |ref=refUrban}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often summarised with the phrase "nothing is true everything is permitted".&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of English Magic| author1 = Carr-Gomm, Philip | author2 = Heygate, Richard | publisher = The Overlook Press| year = 2010| isbn = 9781590207604| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FXUjCQAAQBAJ| ref = refCarr-Gomm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll1/&gt;

Some commentators have traced this position to the influence of [[postmodernism]] on contemporary occultism.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm/&gt; Another influence comes from the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], who believed that belief itself was a form of [[Energy_(psychological)|"psychic energy"]] that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This "free belief" could then be directed towards new aims.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Pleasure: The Psychology of Ecstasy| author = Spare, Austin Osman | publisher = Lulu Press| year = 2013| isbn = 9781105502996| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7lLCAAAQBAJ| ref = refSpare1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = Morrison, Grant| chapter = Pop Magic!| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refMorrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted the influence of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who wrote of the occult:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.&lt;ref name=Crowley1&gt;{{cite book | title = Book 4| author = Crowley, Aleister | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1980| isbn = 9780877285137| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_Q69RL7mJv0C| ref = refCrowley1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kia and Chaos ===

Within the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate ''desire'' to something Spare termed [[Kia_(magic)|"Kia"]] (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the "passage" of the unconscious – hence the need for complex systems of symbolism. Provided there was enough "free belief" to feed them, these desires would then grow, unconsciously, into "obsessions", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book | title = Austin Osman Spare: The Life and Legend of London's Lost Artist| author = Baker, Phil| publisher = Strange Attractor| year = 2011| isbn = 9781907222016| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQu4twAACAAJ| ref = refBaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter J. Carroll inherited this model from Spare, but used the term "Kia" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: "the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed "Chaos". In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later chaos magicians have stressed that this basic operating process can be explained in multiple different ways, from within different paradigms. For example:

* Within a spirit model, the job of a [[shaman]] is to communicate their intentions to their spirit helpers, who then work magic on their behalf. 
* Within an energy model, a magician might direct their own [[qi|qi/ch'i]] towards specific aims.
* Within a psychological model, a magician uses symbols to condition their unconscious to work towards their goals.
* Within an information model, a magician transmits information to an underlying matrix or field in order to produce specific effects.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UD&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/model.html|title = Models of Magic|author = Frater U.'.D.'.|date = 1991|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 6, 2018| ref = refUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

Since chaos magic is built around an experimental, D.I.Y. approach that involves stripping all magical techniques down to their barest essence, any practice from any magical tradition can be incorporated under the banner of chaos magic: from [[satanism|Satanic]] ritual, to [[wicca|Wiccan]] [[sabbats]], to [[energy healing]], to [[tantra|Tantric practices]], etc. However, there are a few techniques that have been specifically developed by chaos magicians, and are unique to the tradition.

=== Gnostic state ===

Most chaos magic techniques involve something called the gnostic state, or [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]]. This is described as an [[altered state of consciousness]] in which a person's mind is focused on [[Samadhi|only one point]], thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out.&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt; The gnostic state is used to bypass the "filter" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

Since it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a "brief 'no-mind' state" in which to work magic.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Three main types of gnosis are described:&lt;ref name=Vitimus&gt;{{cite book |last=Vitimus |first=Andrieh |title=Hands-on Chaos Magic: Reality Manipulation Through the Ovayki Current |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7387-1508-7| ref = refVitimus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Inhibitory gnosis]]''' is a form of deep [[meditation]] into a [[trance]] state of [[mind]]. This type of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] uses slow and regular [[breath]]ing techniques, absent thought processes, [[progressive muscle relaxation]], self-induction and [[self-hypnosis]] techniques. Means employed may also include [[fasting]], [[sleeplessness]], [[sensory deprivation]] and [[hypnotic]] or trance-inducing drugs.

* '''Ecstatic gnosis''' describes a mindlessness reached through intense [[arousal]]. It is aimed to be reached through [[sexual arousal|sexual excitation]], intense [[emotion]]s, [[flagellation]], [[dance]], [[drum]]ming, [[chanting]], [[sensory overload]], [[hyperventilation]] and the use of disinhibitory or hallucinogenic drugs.

* '''Indifferent vacuity''' was described by [[Phil Hine]] and [[Jan Fries]] as a third method. Here the intended spell is cast parenthetically, so it does not raise much thought to suppress – "doodling sigils while listening to a talk which is boring, but you have to take notes on", for example.&lt;ref name=Fries2&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Magick: A Handbook of Freestyle Shamanism |first=Jan |last=Fries |authorlink=Jan Fries |publisher=[[Mandrake of Oxford]] |year=1992 |isbn=1-869928-57-1| ref = refFries2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;

=== Sigils ===

[[File:Sigil shoal.svg|thumb|A shoal of [[sigil_(magic)|sigils]]]]


A [[Sigil_(magic)|sigil]] is a picture or glyph that represents a particular desire or intention. They are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of [[monogram]]. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to "launch" or "charge" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; To quote Ray Sherwin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: there should be "a deliberate striving to forget it", in Spare's words.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;

In the [[Medieval era]], a ''sigil'' was a symbol associated with a particular [[angel]] or [[demon]], which could be used to ritually summon the relevant being.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;{{cite book|title=The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment: A Compendium of Tools &amp; Techniques for Growth &amp; Transformation |author1=Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn|author2=Slate, Joe H. |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2011 |isbn=9780738729862|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OzIvEjvCj1sC|ref = refWeschcke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spare turned this practice on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply [[Complex_(psychology)|complexes]] in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilisation.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a [[servitor (chaos magic)|servitor]].&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marik2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/servitors.html|title = Servitors: Part Two of Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms|author = Marik|date = 1998|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refMarik2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of "group mind", then it is referred to as an [[egregore]].&lt;ref name=Rysen&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/fen-egre.html|title = The Fluid Continuum --or-- What the f***'s an Egregore?|author = Rysen, Fenwick |date = 1999|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refRysen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/gegregor.html|title = Egregore Definition Compilation|author = Emerson, Gabriel|date = 1997|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refEmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. [[Grant Morrison]] coined the term ''hypersigil'' to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His [[comic book]] series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' was intended as such a hypersigil.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Morrison has also argued that modern [[Logo|corporate logos]] like "the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph" are a form of viral sigil:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon White developed the technique of ''shoaling'', which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for "money", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help "shift the probability" towards the overall aim.&lt;ref name=White4&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2012/03/ultimate-sigil-magic-guide/|title = Sigils Reboot: How to get Big Magic from Little Squiggles|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2010/06/shoaling-making-sigil-magic-more-awesome-since-2010/|title = Shoaling: Making Sigil Magic more Awesome Since 2010|author = White, Gordon|date = 2010|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite2}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also developed the technique of the ''robofish'', which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to "lead" the rest of the shoal.&lt;ref name=White3&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2011/07/magic-secrets-as-taught-by-robot-fish/|title = Magic Secrets as Taught by Robot Fish|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cut-up technique ===

The cut-up technique is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name=Cran&gt;{{cite book|title= Collage in Twentieth-Century Art, Literature, and Culture: Joseph Cornell, William Burroughs, Frank O’Hara, and Bob Dylan|author= Cran, Rona|publisher= Routledge|year= 2016|isbn= 9781317164296|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFU3DAAAQBAJ|ref = refCran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the chaos magic organisation [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] in the early 1990s&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/172802/magical_universe_william_s_burroughs/|title = The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs|author = Stevens, Matthew Levi|date = 2013|website = Reality Sandwich|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refStevens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ashejournal.com/2015/03/16/magick-and-photography/|title = Magick and Photography|author = Grant, Douglas|date = 2015|website = Ashe Journal|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refGrantD}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating "the cut ups are not for artistic purposes".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cambridge Companion to the Beats| author = Harris, Oliver| chapter = William S. Burroughs: Beating Postmodernism| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2017| editor = Belletto, Steven | isbn = 9781107184459| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NYXuDQAAQBAJ| ref = refHarris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs used his cut-ups for "political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration"&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to "break down the barriers that surround consciousness".&lt;ref name=Burroughs&gt;{{cite book | title = The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs| author = Burroughs, William S.| publisher = Penguin UK| year = 2012| isbn = 9780141903583| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DivGjW-qEv8C| ref = refBurroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Burroughs himself stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I've made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.&lt;ref name=Burroughs/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Bowie]] compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the [[I Ching]] or [[Tarot]].&lt;ref name=Doggett&gt;{{cite book | title = The Man who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s| author = Doggett, Peter| publisher = Random House| year = 2011| isbn = 9781847921451| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KC5yOXoyXioC| ref = refDoggett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other chaos magicians have elaborated on the basic technique. [[Genesis P-Orridge]], who studied under Burroughs, describes it as a way to "identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated."&lt;ref name=P-Orridge&gt;{{cite book | title = THEE PSYCHICK BIBLE: Thee Apocryphal Scriptures ov Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and Thee Third Mind ov Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth| author = P-Orridge, Genesis Breyer| publisher = Feral House| year = 2010| isbn = 9781932595949| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X1FjCwAAQBAJ| ref = refP-Orridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]] suggested various magical ways to use the cut-up technique, such as cutting together two people to form a love spell.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web |url = https://chaotopia.co.uk/cutupcoll.html|title = Cut Up and Collage in Magic|author = Lee, Dave|date = 1989|website = Chaotopia!|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synchromysticism ===

[[Synchromysticism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[synchronicity]] and [[mysticism]], is "the art of realising meaningful coincidences in the seemingly mundane with mystical or esoteric significance".&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/1377/the_cryptic_cosmology_synchromysticism/ |title = The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism |author = Valis | date = 2008 | website = Reality Sandwich | access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refValis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Life of Movies: Schizophrenic and Shamanic Journeys in American Cinema |author= Horsley, Jason |publisher=McFarland|year=2009 |isbn= 9780786454624 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SRDvgD-SADAC |ref = refHorsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were clear that the "results" to be attained through their techniques consisted of synchronicities, with Carroll stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for ''deliberately engineering synchronicities''.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;{{cite book | title = Octavo: A Sorceror-Scientist's Grimoire (Roundworld Edition) | author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781906958176 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x6UUTwEACAAJ | ref = refCarroll4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2013/04/twilight-language-the-quest-for-the-grail/|title = Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail |author = White, Gordon|date = 2013|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refWhite6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and influences (1974-1982) ===

[[File:Austin_Osman_Spare.jpg|thumb|[[Austin Osman Spare]], whose ideas formed the basis of chaos magic. Photo taken 1904.]]

Chaos magic was first developed in England in the mid-1970s, at a time when British occultism was dominated by [[Wicca]] and [[Thelema]].&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Although both of these traditions incorporate magical elements, they are both religions, and as such contain devotional elements, [[liturgy]] and [[dogma]]. Chaos magic grew out of the desire of some occultists to strip away these extrinsic details and distill [[Magic_(paranormal)|magic]] down to a set of tried-and-tested techniques for causing effects to occur in reality.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is "Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master."&lt;ref name=Carroll3&gt;{{cite book | title = Psybermagick: Advanced Ideas in Chaos Magick: Revised Edition| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2008| isbn = 9781935150657| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mxLHPAAACAAJ| ref = refCarroll3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]] are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although [[Phil Hine]] points out that there were others "lurking in the background, such as the ''Stoke Newington Sorcerors''"&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a group which included [[Charles Brewster]] (Frater Choronzon).&lt;ref name=IOT&gt;{{cite book| title = The Secrets of the Illuminates of Thanateros| author = IOT| publisher = The Illuminates of Thanateros| year = 2002| url = http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf| ref = refIOT| access-date = 2018-06-10| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060917214610/http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf#| archive-date = 2006-09-17| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll was a regular contributor to ''[[The New Equinox]]'', a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

1978 was perhaps the seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both ''Liber Null'' by Carroll and ''The Book of Results'' by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic – and the establishment of [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] (IOT), the first chaos magic organization.&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;

[[Austin Osman Spare]] is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Specifically, Spare developed the use of [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]s and the use of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] to empower these. Most basic sigil work recapitulates Spare's technique, including the construction of a phrase detailing the magical intent, the elimination of duplicate letters, and the artistic recombination of the remaining letters to form the sigil. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, many consider him to be the grandfather of chaos magic because of his repudiation of traditional magical systems in favor of a technique based on gnosis.

[[Aleister Crowley]] was a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his [[syncretic]] approach to magic, and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; Other early influences include [[Discordianism]], the [[punk subculture|punk]] movement, [[postmodernism]] and the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; [[Lionel Snell]] was also publishing writing on Spare in the mid-1970s, and became drawn into the burgeoning chaoist movement. Snell's book ''[[SSOTBME]]'' (1974) also came to influence the early chaos magicians.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

However, despite these influences, it's clear from their early writings that the first chaos magicians were attempting to recover a sort of universal [[shamanism]] by stripping away any accumulated cultural gloss. Carroll makes this clear in ''Liber Null'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is echoed in Snell's description of Spare as a "master shaman" who brought into the world a new form of "shamanistic sorcery".&lt;ref name=Snell1&gt;{{cite web |url = https://fulgur.co.uk/austin-osman-spare/exploring-spares-magic|title = Exploring Spare's Magic|author = Snell, Lionel|date = 1987|website = Fulgur|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refSnell1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early development and spread (1982-1994) ===

New chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in [[Yorkshire]], where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called ''The Sorceror's Apprentice'', owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called ''The Lamp of Thoth'', which published articles on chaos magic, and his ''Sorceror's Apprentice Press'' re-released both ''Liber Null'' and ''The Book of Results'', as well as ''Psychonaut'' and ''The Theatre of Magic''.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; ''The Circle of Chaos'', which included [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], was formed in Yorkshire in 1982.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baph&gt;{{cite web |url = https://theblogofbaphomet.com/2012/12/08/an-audience-with-dave-lee/|title = An Audience with Dave Lee|author1 = Vayne, Julian|author2=Dee, Steve|author3=Wyrd, Nikki|date = 2012|website = The Blog of Baphomet|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refBaph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as ''The Cardinal Rites of Chaos'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;

[[Ralph Tegtmeier]] (Frater U.D.), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of "ice magick", translated ''Liber Null'' into German.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2&gt;{{cite book | title = Chaonomicon| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Lulu| year = 2017| isbn = 9780244916633| ref = refHawkins2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order. He was excommunicated in 1990 over the "Ice Magic Wars".&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; Lola Babalon established the first American IOT temple in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt;

As chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin's circle began publishing on the topic. [[Phil Hine]], who practiced chaos magic alongside [[Tantra]] and [[Wicca]], published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet.&lt;ref name=Gyrus&gt;{{cite web |url = https://dreamflesh.com/interview/phil-hine/|title = Chaos and Beyond|author = Gyrus|date = 1997|website = Dreamflesh|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refGyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wiccanrede.org/2010/12/interview-with-phil-hine/|title = Before, Chaos, and After|author = Blackwell, Christopher|date = 2010|website = Wiccan Rede|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refBlackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaq D. Hawkins, from California, wrote an article on chaos magic for ''Mezlim'' magazine, coming into contact with Sherwin and other IOT members in the process. Hawkins later wrote the first chaos magic book intended for a general readership.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; In 1992, [[Jan Fries]] published ''Visual Magick'', introducing his own blend of "freestyle shamanism", which has had influence on chaos magic.&lt;ref name=Fries&gt;{{cite book | title = Visual Magick: A Practical Guide to Trance, Sigils and Visualization Techniques| author = Fries, Jan| publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 2000|isbn = 9781869928575| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsfSAAAACAAJ| ref = refFries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Genesis P-Orridge]] established [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] (TOPY), an art collective and magical order.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; P-Orridge had studied magic under [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]] in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic movement]].&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = P-Orridge, Genesis| chapter = Magick Squares and Future Beats| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refP-Orridge2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the [[Acid House]] and [[Industrial music]] scenes.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; They were also partially responsible for introducing the techniques of Burroughs and Gysin to the chaos magic stream&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; – but this influence also ran the other way, with Burroughs (who already practiced magic and was experimenting with Spare's sigil technique)&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD/&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; being inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

=== Pop culture: (1994-early 2000s) ===

From the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of [[pop culture]] in addition to that of "authentic" magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The [[symbol of chaos]], for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref name=Nozedar&gt;{{cite book | title = Secret Signs and Symbols: The Ultimate A-Z Guide from Alchemy to the Zodiac| author = Nozedar, Adele | publisher = HarperCollins UK| year = 2008| isbn = 9780007264452| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=an67pzmMJb4C | ref = refNozedar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preluded by [[Kenneth Grant]] – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of [[H._P._Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft's]] fictional [[Cthulhu mythos]] into his own magical writings&lt;ref name=Lavenda&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dark Lord: H.P. Lovecraft, Kenneth Grant and the Typhonian Tradition in Magic| author = Levenda, Peter | publisher = Nicolas-Hays, Inc.| year = 2013| isbn = 9780892542079| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DPQ9TUaEKjMC | ref = refLavenda}}&lt;/ref&gt; – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft's work, such as the [[Great Old Ones]]. Hine, for example, published ''The Pseudonomicon'' (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.&lt;ref name=Hine3&gt;{{cite book | title = The Pseudonomicon| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150640| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EC5hQwAACAAJ | ref = refHine3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, by the mid-1990s, chaos magic itself was beginning to leak into pop culture. Many of the writers and artists who produced strips for British [[sci-fi]] [[comic]] [[2000_AD_(comics)|2000ad]] also practiced chaos magic – among them [[Pat Mills]],&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chaos-in-the-uk-from-the-klf-to-reclaim-the-streets/ |date=April 7, 2017 |title=Chaos in the UK: From the KLF to Reclaim the Streets |last=Clutterbuck |first=Brenton |website=Historia Discordia |access-date=June 12, 2018 |ref=refClutterbuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Talbot]],&lt;ref name=Thorpe&gt;{{cite web |url = http://awfullybigblogadventure.blogspot.com/2014/05/comics-anarchy-chaos-magick-and-george.html|title = Comics, anarchy, chaos magick and George Orwell|author = Thorpe, David|date = 2014|website = An Awfully Big Blog Adventure|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Skinner]],&lt;ref name=Molcher&gt;{{cite book | title = 2000 AD: The Creator Interviews - Volume 01| author = Molcher, Michael | publisher = 2000 AD Books| year = 2015| isbn = 9781849973236| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eb7XAAAAQBAJ | ref = refMolcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dave Thorpe]]&lt;ref name=Thorpe/&gt; – and many included frequent references to chaos magic in their work. Mills, for example, created the characters of [[Nemesis the Warlock]] and [[ABC_Warriors#Deadlock|Deadlock]], both of whom practiced "khaos magick".&lt;ref name=talkingcomicssite&gt;{{cite web |url = https://talkingcomicssite.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/nemesis-and-deadlock-a-magickal-partnership/|title = Nemesis and Deadlock: A Magickal Partnership|author = talkingcomicssite|date = 2017|website = talkingcomicssite|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = reftalkingcomicssite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Morrison]], who began practicing chaos magic at 19,&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arthurmag.com/2007/02/01/interview-with-grant-morrison-from-the-pages-of-arthur-magazine/|title = One Nervous System’s Passage Through Time|author = Babcock, Jay|date = 2004|website = Arthur|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refBabcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the series [[Zenith_(comics)|''Zenith'']] for 2000ad. ''Zenith'' frequently featured chaos magic themes, as well as a distinct Lovecraftian influence, and the [[Cthulhu mythos]]-inspired monsters of the story were copied straight from the illustrations of ''Liber Null''&lt;ref name=Sarkos&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sarkos.tumblr.com/post/71301152131/just-random-info-the-old-ones-and-the-mysterious|title = The Old Ones and the mysterious Brian Ward|author = Sarkos|date = 2013|website = Hate:Wreck:Peril|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refSarkos}}&lt;/ref&gt; – leading to the threat of a lawsuit from Peter Carroll.&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck/&gt;

From 1994 to 2000, Morrison wrote ''[[The Invisibles]]'' for [[DC_Comics|DC Comics']] [[Vertigo_(DC_Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a "hypersigil": "a dynamic miniature model of the magician's universe, a hologram, microcosm or 'voodoo doll' which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of 'real' life."&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Both ''The Invisibles'' and the activities of Morrison himself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining his views on chaos magic in the "Pop Magic!" chapter of ''A Book of Lies'' (2003)&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; a [[Disinformation_(company)|Disinfo Convention]] talk,&lt;ref name=Metzger2&gt;{{cite book | title = Disinformation: The Interviews: Uncut &amp; Uncensored| author = Metzger, Richard | publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2002| isbn = 9781609259365| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SdpAB7sbkZwC | ref = refMetzger2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the documentary ''[[Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods]]''.&lt;ref name=Thill&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2010/11/grant-morrison-talking-with-gods-review/|title = Review: Talking With Gods Bows Down to Comics Immortal Grant Morrison|author = Thill, Scott|date = 2010|website = Wired.com|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThill}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morrison's particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions ([[Hermes]], [[Mercury_(mythology)|Mercury]], [[Thoth]], [[Ganesh]], etc.) are nothing more than different cultural "glosses" for more universal "big ideas"&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like [[The Flash]], or [[Metron_(comics)|Metron]], or [[Madonna_(entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt;

=== Post-chaos magic: 2010s ===

Over the course of the past decade, chaos magic has experienced a shift away from the pop cultural interpretation that typified the Lovecraft/Morrison era. Jason Miller has argued that contemporary occultism has entered a "post-chaos" phase, in which chaos magicians are increasingly initiating into "very old lineage traditions", partially triggered by the realisation that "imaginary gods and spirits or fictional characters ''do not'' seem to have the same effect as traditional ones".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inominandum.com/blog/post-chaos-magic-1st-in-a-series/|title = Post Chaos Magic: 1st in a series.|author = Miller, Jason|date = 2012|website = Strategic Sorcery Blog|access-date = June 13, 2018| ref = refMiller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hine has spoken of his disillusionment with the idea that all magic "can be formulated in terms of 'techniques' and that the theoretical underpinnings or cultural-historical context" do not matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...something you’ll sometimes see advocates of CM asserting is that singing [[rune]] charms and repeating [[Hindu]] [[mantras]] are essentially the same procedure – the focus being on the repetition of a word or phrase – in order to enter an altered state of consciousness. So mantras are something that gets chanted – and the chanting (i.e. the iteration) is what’s important – not the content or the context.

This, to me, is a kind of [[reductionism]]. It predicates a [[universalism|universal explanation]] – that the ‘technique’ of iterative speech is enacted in order to establish an [[altered state of consciousness]] in the practitioner – and subordinates all instances which apparently look as though that’s what’s going on – to it. So for an advocate of CM, there would be little practical difference between, say, chanting a [[rune]] poem, repeating the [[Gayatri]] mantra, or singing a [[sea shanty]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for "breathing new life" into Western occultism, thereby saving it from "being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality" – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of "initiatory knowledge": i.e., "teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated", present in all traditional schools of magic.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book | title = Advanced Magick for Beginners| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = Karnac Books| year = 2008| isbn = 9781904658412| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1lT7R6QD16oC | ref = refChapman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman has gone on to develop his own system, using the techniques of chaos magic to achieve the aims of [[Thelema]], such as attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]], or the Crossing of [[Abyss_(Thelema)|the Abyss]].&lt;ref name=Chapman2&gt;{{cite book | title = Three Steps to Heaven: How to Practice Magick| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = The Baptist's Head| year = 2009 | ref = refChapman2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon White, meanwhile, has developed a distinctive blend of chaos magic technique and [[animism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the western esoteric tradition can be said to have an underlying belief system it is a form of Animism; that the world or the universe is in some sense a living thing... However you conceive of their 'true' nature, magic requires full engagement with [[Fetishism|fetishes]] and sacred ground and window areas such as [[Crossroads_(mythology)|crossroads]]. It also works best when you grant agency to objects or entities beyond human consciousness, and particularly so with living systems... It is more useful for the magician to consider living systems not as some unaware little eddies in a universal consciousness field, but as 'outposts' of the spirit world.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">[[Fred Lerdahl]]'s '''"Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems"''' cites [[Pierre Boulez]]'s ''[[Le Marteau sans Maître]]'' (1955) as an example of "a huge gap between compositional system and cognized result," though he "could have illustrated just as well with works by [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], or [[Iannis Xenakis]]". (In [[semiology|semiological]] terms, this is a gap between the [[esthesic and poietic]] processes.) To explain this gap, and in hopes of bridging it, Lerdahl proposes the concept of a [[musical grammar]], "a limited set of rules that can generate indefinitely large sets of musical events and/or their structural descriptions." He divides this further into compositional grammar and listening grammar, the latter being one "more or less unconsciously employed by auditors, that generates mental representations of the music". He divides the former into natural and artificial compositional grammars. While the two have historically been fruitfully mixed, a natural grammar arises spontaneously in a culture while an artificial one is a conscious invention of an individual or group in a culture; the gap can arise only between listening grammar and artificial grammars. To begin to understand the listening grammar Lerdahl and [[Ray Jackendoff]] created a theory of musical cognition, ''[[Generative theory of tonal music|A Generative Theory of Tonal Music]]'' (1983; {{ISBN|0-262-62107-X}}). That theory is outlined in the essay. Lerdahl's constraints on artificial compositional grammars are:

==Constraints on event sequences==

*''Constraint 1'': The musical surface must be capable of being parsed into a sequence of discrete events.
**[counterexample: Ligeti, computer music]
*''Constraint 2'': The musical surface must be available for [[hierarchical]] structuring by the listening grammar.
**[through grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction, and prolongational reduction. "Associational" factors such as [[Motif (music)|motivic]] development and [[timbre|timbral]] relations are ignored, but for "Timbral Hierarchies" see Lerdahl 1987]
*''Constraint 3'': The establishment of local grouping boundaries requires the presence of salient distinctive transitions at the musical surface.
**[counterexample: [[minimal music]]]
*''Constraint 4'': Projections of groups, especially at larger levels, depends on [[symmetry]] and on the establishment of musical [[parallelism (music)|parallelism]]s.
*''Constraint 5'': The establishment of a [[Metre (poetry)|metrical structure]] requires a degree of regularity in the placement of [[Stress (linguistics)|phenomenal accent]]s.
*''Constraint 6'': A complex time-span segmentation depends on the projection of complex grouping and metrical structures.
*''Constraint 7'': The projection of a time-span tree depends on a complex time-span segmentation in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.
*''Constraint 8'': The projection of a prolongational tree depends on a corresponding time-span tree in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.

==Constraints on underlying materials==

*''Constraint 9'': Stability conditions must operate on a fixed collection of elements.
**[usually pitches or rather fundamentals with harmonic partials]
*''Constraint 10'': [[Interval (music)|Intervals]] between elements of a collection arranged along a scale should fall within a certain range of magnitude.
*''Constraint 11'': A [[pitch (music)|pitch]] collection should recur at the [[octave]] to produce [[pitch class]]es.
**[ [[octave equivalency]] ]
*''Constraint 12'': There must be a strong [[psychoacoustic]] basis for stability conditions. For pitch collections, that requires intervals that proceed gradually from very small to comparatively large frequency [[ratio]]s.
**[ [[just intonation]] ]
*''Constraint 13'': Division of the octave into equal parts facilitates [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and reduces memory load.
**[ [[equal temperament]] ]
*''Constraint 14'': Assume pitch sets of ''n''-fold equal divisions of the octave. Then subsets that satisfy uniqueness, coherence, and simplicity will facilitate location within the overall pitch space.
**[only certain divisions of the octave, 12 and 20 included, allow uniqueness, coherence, and transpositional simplicity, and only the diatonic and pentatonic subsets of the 12-tone chromatic set follow these constraints (Balzano, 1980, 1982)]

==Pitch space==

*''Constraint 15'': Any but the most primitive stability conditions must be susceptible to multidimensional representation, where spatial distance correlates with cognitive distance.
*''Constraint 16'': Levels of pitch space must be sufficiently available from musical surfaces to be internalized.
*''Constraint 17'': A reductionally organized pitch space is needed to express the [[steps and skips]] by which cognitive distance is measured and to express degrees of melodic completeness.
**[completedness resembles implication-realization theory (Meyer, 1973 and Narmour, 1977), the ''Zug'', ''[[Urlinie]]'', and ''[[Bassbrechung]]'' (Schenker).]

He concludes, "Some of these constraints seem to me binding, others optional. Constraints 9-12 are essential for the very existence of stability conditions. Constraints 13-17, on the other hand, can be variously jettisoned." Examples given are [[Carnatic music|South Indian music]], which doesn't [[modulation (music)|modulate]] and isn't equally tempered (13 &amp; 14), and music such as that of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], and others who "have developed consonance-dissonance patterns directly from the [[total chromatic]]" (14-17).

==Comprehensibility and value==

*''Aesthetic Claim 1'': The best music utilizes the full potential of our cognitive resources.
*''Aesthetic Claim 2'': The best music arises from an alliance of a compositional grammar with the listening grammar.

To these ends he proposes the use of the terms "[[complexity]]" and "complicatedness", complexity being hierarchical structural richness, and complicatedness being "numerous non-redundant events per unit time." On Lerdahl's view complexity has aesthetic value, while complicatedness is neutral. He writes, "All sorts of music satisfy these criteria — for example, Indian [[raga]], Japanese [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[jazz]], and most Western [[art music]]. [[Rock music]] fails on grounds of insufficient complexity. Much [[contemporary music]] pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity. In short, these criteria allow for infinite variety but only along certain lines."

"I find this conclusion both exciting and — initially at least — alarming...the constraints are tighter than I bargained for."

"My second aesthetic claim in effect rejects this ["progressivist"] attitude in favor of the older view that music-making should be based on "nature". For the ancients, nature may have resided in the music of the spheres, but for us it lies in the musical mind."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Compurgation''', also called '''wager of law''' and '''oath-helping''', was a defence used primarily in medieval law.  A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an [[oath]] and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, ''com'' = with, ''purgare'' = make clean, cleanse, excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/compurgation.html |title=English etymology of compurgation |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''com'' is also an intensifier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last = Delbridge |editor-first = A ||display-editors=etal |title = Macquarie Australia's National Dictionary |publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty |year = 1997 |page = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to thoroughly clean or excuse'.

The wager of law was essentially a character reference, initially by kin and later by neighbours (from the same region as the defendant), often 11 or 12 men, and it was a way to give credibility to the oath of a defendant at a time when a person's oath had more credibility than a written record.  It can be compared to [[legal wager]], which is the provision of surety at the beginning of legal action to minimize frivolous litigation.

Compurgation was found in [[early Germanic law]], in early French law (''très ancienne coutume de Bretagne''), in [[Welsh law]], and in the English [[ecclesiastical courts]] until the seventeenth century. In [[common law]] it was substantially abolished as a defence in [[felonies]] by the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] in 1164. The defence was still permitted in [[civil action]]s for debt and vestiges of it survived until its statutory repeal at various times in common law countries: in England in 1833,&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; and [[Queensland]] at some point before the Queensland Common Practice Act of 1867&lt;ref name="QCLPA"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/C/CommLawPracA1867_01_.pdf |format = PDF |title=Common Law Practice Act 1867 |publisher=Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel |date=24 June 1994 |quote = Wager of law abolished – 3. No wager of law shall be allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

"Wager of Law, obsolete for centuries" was "a living fossil... a dead letter statute" and was repealed in England in 1833.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir
|title = The Legal System: A Social Science Perspective |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation
|year=1975 |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The procedure in a wager of law is traced by [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect on the development of the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2|wstitle=Wager |volume=28 |page=229 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri28chis#page/229/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[Compurgation] had originated in Anglo-Saxon England in the ties of kinship that bound people together in the period before the year 1000, a time when each man was responsible for the acts of his blood relatives. Later, kinship gave way to a more tribal affiliation and a loyalty to the place of one's birth. When disputes more often than not led to violence, it seemed natural that neighbors would band together. They aligned themselves with a neighbour who was accused in court and swore that in good conscience they believed he was telling the truth. The number of oath-helpers required depended on the defendant's rank and the character of the lawsuit. Eventually it became standard practice to bring eleven neighbours into court to swear for the defendant. The oath-helpers were called compurgators, and the wager of law was called compurgation.&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wager+of+law |title=Wager of law legal definition of Wager of law |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Wager of law, wager of battle and trial by ordeal==
The wager of law, also called compurgation, is an old legal practice, dating back to Saxon and feudal times, which was [[Contemporary history|contemporaneous]] to the appeal to God to prove fact by [[trial by battle]] (wager of battle, [[trial by combat]], or judicial duel), and of [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=hamowy&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj23n2/cj23n2-7.pdf |format=PDF |title=F. A. Hayek and the Common Law |first=Ronald |last=Hamowy
|journal=Cato Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat — [[Trial by combat#Great Britain and Ireland|real in English law]], feigned in Roman law — no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

==Surety==
A variation was for the defendant to give gage, or sureties, in an action of debt, and "that at a certain day assigned he would take a law, or oath, in open court, that he did not owe the debt, and at the same time bring with him eleven neighbors (called compurgators), who should avow upon their oaths that they believed in their consciences that he spoke the truth" (see the [[Tractatus of Glanvill|''Tractatus'' of Glanvill]], ca. 1188).

==Determining fact==
Wager of law was replaced by jury, from early times, to determine fact, at a time that judges managed legal procedure and did not determine fact. Trial "by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (legus terrae)" Cap. 29 of the [[Magna Carta]] 1215 to 1297.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html |title=Featured Document: The Magna Carta |publisher=Archives.gov |date=|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law was practised in England (and English  American colonies) until the 16th century, in criminal matters, and the 19th century, in civil matters.

==Supporting defendant's oath==
A defendant who elected to "make his law" was permitted to make a statement before the court, swear an oath that it was true, and present one or more individuals, often 12, who swore that they believed he had told the truth under oath. The predominant form of defense in the feudal courts, it persisted for a time in the common-law courts. The individuals "did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a man’s oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions (penalties), individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that 'wagers in law' were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130405/compurgation |title=compurgation |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh law]] allowed for a form of compurgation called [[assach]], which required not 12 but 300 compurgators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Maitland0161/CollectedPapers/Vol1/HTMLs/0242-01_Pt03_Essays1.html|title=The Laws of Wales|work=The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland|author=Fisher, H.A.L.|authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher| accessdate=2006-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of wager of law==
{{quote|As the kings consolidated their power, suppressing violence and increasing the authority of the courts, the wager of law lost some of its ancient power and became a nuisance to litigants, who suspected that it frequently opened the door to false swearing. Different forms of action developed that did not permit the wager of law as a defense, and plaintiffs used them as much as possible. The procedure of wager of law had long since been obsolete when it was abolished during the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413).&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"/&gt;}}

The taking of oaths was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form of action other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

Trial by ordeal was abolished by order of the Lateran Council of 1215. Trial by battle was abolished in 1819 and wager of law was abolished in 1833, although both had fallen into disuse before their formal abolition.&lt;ref name=hamowy/&gt;

Wager of law was used as late as 1829, when the Rev. Fearon Jenkinson of Gnosall, Staffordshire used it against a Stafford ironmonger who claimed he was owed money by him. Jenkinson and his compurgators did not appear on the date.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Chronicle, 5 June 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law survived to recent centuries and in many jurisdictions it has been abolished by statute. It was abolished in New South Wales in 1841 by the Advancement of Justice Act 1841 (both Victoria and Queensland were still part of New South Wales at this time). This was re-enacted after separation of Queensland from New South Wales in the Queensland Common Law Practice Act 1867, but was strictly unnecessary, given its earlier abolition in 1841 &lt;ref name="QCLPA" /&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

No wager of law was allowed in [[assumpsit]], even though the cause of action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of assumpsit — proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant — as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 William IV. c. 42).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

'''Computational law''' is a branch of [[legal informatics]] concerned with the [[mechanization]] of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complaw.stanford.edu/|title=Computational Law - The Cop in the Backseat|first=Michael|last=Genesereth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It emphasizes explicit behavioral constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct.  Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.

Philosophically, computational law sits within the [[legal formalism|Legal Formalist]] school of [[jurisprudence]].  Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] settings, where laws are taken more or less literally.  It is less applicable to legal systems based on [[common law]], which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations.  However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in [[de facto]] rules.

From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth.  Some systems of this sort already exist.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[TurboTax]] is a good example.  And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the [[Internet]] in human interaction and the proliferation of [[embedded computer system]]s (such as [[smart phones]], [[self-driving cars]], and [[robot]]s).

== History ==
Speculation about potential benefits to legal practice through applying methods from computational science and AI research to automate parts of the law date back at least to the middle 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;18 Rocky Mntn. L. Rev. 378 (1945-1946) Does the Law Need a Technological Revolution; Kelso, Louis O.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Artificial intelligence and law|AI and law]] and computational law do not seem easily separable, as perhaps most of AI research focusing on the law and its automation appears to utilize computational methods. The forms that speculation took are multiple and not all related in ways to readily show closeness to one another. This history will sketch them as they were, attempting to show relationships where they can be found to have existed.

By 1949, a minor [[academic field]] aiming to incorporate [[Data storage|electronic]] and [[computational]] methods to legal problems had been founded by American legal scholars, called [[jurimetrics]].&lt;ref&gt;33 Minn. L. Rev. 455 (1948-1949) Jurimetrics--The Next Step Forward; Loevinger, Lee&lt;/ref&gt; Though broadly said to be concerned with the application of the "methods of science" to the law, these methods were actually of a quite specifically defined scope. Jurimetrics was to be "concerned with such matters as the quantitative analysis of judicial behavior, the application of communication and information theory to legal expression, the use of mathematical logic in law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic and mechanical means, and the formulation of a calculus of legal predictability".&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, Lee. "Jurimetrics: The methodology of legal inquiry." ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' (1963): 5-35. At 8.&lt;/ref&gt; These interests led in 1959 to the founding a journal, ''Modern Uses of Logic in Law'', as a forum wherein articles would be published about the applications of techniques such as mathematical logic, engineering, statistics, etc. to the legal study and development.&lt;ref&gt;"About Jurimetrics." ''About the Journal''. American Bar Association Section of Science &amp; Technology Law and the Center for Law, Science &amp; Innovation, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.law.asu.edu/jurimetrics/JurimetricsJournal/AbouttheJournal.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, this Journal was renamed as ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid,''&lt;/ref&gt;'' ''Today, however, the journal and meaning of jurimetrics seems to have broadened far beyond what would fit under the areas of applications of computers and computational methods to law. Today the journal not only publishes articles on such practices as found in computational law, but has broadened jurimetrical concerns to mean also things like the use of social science in law or the "policy implications [of] and legislative and administrative control of science".&lt;ref name="ibid."&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently in 1958, at the Conference for the Mechanization of Thought held at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in [[Teddington]], Middlesex, UK, the French jurist Lucien Mehl presented a paper both on the benefits of using computational methods for law and on the potential means to use such methods to automate law for a discussion that included AI luminaries like [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and the Law: Inaugural Lecture of the Professor of Computer Science Delivered at the College on January 25, 1977''. Swansea, Wales: U College of Swansea, 1977. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehl believed that the law could by automated by two basic distinct, though not wholly separable, types of machine. These were the "documentary or information machine", which would provide the legal researcher quick access to relevant case precedents and legal scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;"Automation in the Legal World." ''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. 755-87. Print. At 759.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "consultation machine", which would be "capable of answering any question put to it over a vast field of law".&lt;ref&gt;"Automation in the Legal World." ''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. 755-87. Print. At 768-769.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter type of machine would be able to basically do much of a lawyer's job by simply giving the "exact answer to a [legal] problem put to it".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid. ''768.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Mehl's first type of machine, one that would be able to retrieve information, had been accomplished but there seems to have been little consideration of further fruitful intersections between AI and legal research.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning
Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick, ''Stanford Law Review'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 40.
&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, still hopes that computers could model the lawyer's thought processes through computational methods and then apply that capacity to solve legal problems, thus automating and improving legal services via increased efficiency as well as shedding light on the nature of legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning

Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick

''Stanford Law Review'',Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 51-60.
&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, computer science and the affordability of computer technology had progressed enough that the retrieval of "legal data by electronic and mechanical means" had been achieved by machines fitting Mehl's first type and were in common use in American law firms.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Decisions and Information Systems. Jon Bing and Trygve Harvold. Oslo, Norway: Universitets Forlaget; 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, research focused on improving the goals of the early 1970s occurred, with programs like ''Taxman'' being worked on in order to both bring useful computer technology into the law as practical aids and to help specify the exact nature of legal concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., L. Thorne McCarty, ''Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning, ''90 Harv. L. Rev. 837-895 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, progress on the second type of machine, one that would more fully automate the law, remained relatively inert.&lt;ref&gt;''Supra'', Niblett, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into machines that could answer questions in the way that Mehl's consultation machine would picked up somewhat in the late 1970s and 1980s. A 1979 convention in [[Swansea]], Wales marked the first international effort solely to focus upon applying artificial intelligence research to legal problems in order to "consider how computers can be used to discover and apply the legal norms embedded within the written sources of the law".&lt;ref&gt;B. Niblett, editor. Computer Science and Law: An Advanced Course. Cambridge University Press, 1980. This volume is a record of the proceedings of a workshop held at University College of Swansea, Wales, September 17–27, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200. At 189.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, little substantial progress seems to have been made in the following decade of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Though this is contestable. For an argument supporting, see McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 review of Anne Gardner's book ''An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Legal Reasoning ''(1987), the Harvard academic legal scholar and computer scientist Edwina Rissland wrote that "She plays, in part, the role of pioneer; [[artificial intelligence]] ("AI") techniques have not yet been widely applied to perform legal tasks. Therefore, Gardner, and this review, first describe and define the field, then demonstrate a working model in the domain of contract offer and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, Edwina. "Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning: A Discussion of the Field and Gardner's Book." ''AI Magazine'' 9.3 (1988): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years after the Swansea conference had passed, and still AI and law researchers merely trying to delineate the field could be described by their own kind as "pioneer[s]".

In the 1990s and early 2000s more progress occurred. Computational research generated insights for law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kades, Eric, "The Laws of Complexity &amp; the Complexity of Laws: The Implications of Computational Complexity Theory for the Law" 49 Rutgers Law Review 403-484 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The First International Conference on AI and the Law occurred it 1987, but it is in the 1990s and 2000s that the biannual conference began to build up steam and to delve more deeply into the issues involved with work intersecting computational methods, AI, and law.&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, E.

''Stanford Computational Law''. Stanford University, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://complaw.stanford.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods in fact advanced enough that members of the legal profession began in the 2000s to both analyze, predict and worry about the potential future of computational law and a new academic field of computational legal studies seems to be now well established. As insight into what such scholars see in the law's future due in part to computational law, here is quote from a recent conference about the "New Normal" for the legal profession:

:"Over the last 5 years, in the fallout of the Great Recession, the legal profession has entered the era of the New Normal. Notably, a series of forces related to technological change, globalization, and the pressure to do more with less (in both corporate America and law firms) has changed permanently the legal services industry. As '''one article''' put it, firms are cutting back on hiring "in order to increase efficiency, improve profit margins, and reduce client costs." Indeed, in its recently noted cutbacks, Weil Gotshal's '''leaders remarked''' that it had initially expected old work to return, but came "around to the view that this is the ‘new normal.’"The New Normal provides lawyers with an opportunity to rethink—and reimagine—the role of lawyers in our economy and society. To the extent that law firms enjoyed, or still enjoy, the ability to bundle work together, that era is coming to an end, as clients unbundle legal services and tasks. Moreover, in other cases, automation and technology can change the roles of lawyers, both requiring them to oversee processes and use technology more aggressively as well as doing less of the work that is increasingly managed by computers (think: electronic discovery). The upside is not only greater efficiencies for society, but new possibilities for legal craftsmanship. The emerging craft of lawyering in the New Normal is likely to require lawyers to be both entrepreneurial and fluent with a range of competencies that will enable them to add value for clients. Apropos of the trends noted above, there are emerging opportunities for "legal entrepreneurs" in a range of roles from legal process management to developing technologies to manage legal operations (such as overseeing automated processes) to supporting online dispute resolution processes. In other cases, effective legal training as well as domain specific knowledge (finance, sales, IT, entrepreneurship, human resources, etc.) can form a powerful combination that prepares law school grads for a range of opportunities (business development roles, financial operations roles, HR roles, etc.). In both cases, traditional legal skills alone will not be enough to prepare law students for these roles. But the proper training, which builds on the traditional law school curriculum and goes well beyond it including practical skills, relevant domain knowledge (e.g., accounting), and professional skills (e.g., working in teams), will provide law school students a huge advantage over those with a one-dimensional skill set."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of Law School Innovation (Conference @ColoradoLaw)."Computational Legal Studies''. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://computationallegalstudies.com/2014/04/17/the-future-of-law-school-innovation-conference-coloradolaw/&gt;.''&lt;/ref&gt;''
Many see perks to oncoming changes brought about by the computational automation of law. For one thing, legal experts have predicted that it will aid legal self-help, especially in the areas of contract formation, enterprise planning, and the prediction of rule changes.&lt;ref name="ibid."/&gt; For another thing, those with knowledge about computers see the potential for computational law to really fully bloom as eminent. In this vein, it seems that machines like Mehl's second type may come into existence. [[Stephen Wolfram]] has said that:

:"So we're slowly moving toward people being educated in the kind of computational paradigm. Which is good, because the way I see it, computation is going to become central to almost every field. Let's talk about two examples—classic professions: law and medicine. It's funny, when Leibniz was first thinking about computation at the end of the 1600s, the thing he wanted to do was to build a machine that would effectively answer legal questions. It was too early then. But now we’re almost ready, I think, for computational law. Where for example contracts become computational. They explicitly become algorithms that decide what's possible and what's not.You know, some pieces of this have already happened. Like with financial derivatives, like options and futures. In the past these used to just be natural language contracts. But then they got codified and parametrized. So they’re really just algorithms, which of course one can do meta-computations on, which is what has launched a thousand hedge funds, and so on. Well, eventually one's going to be able to make computational all sorts of legal things, from mortgages to tax codes to perhaps even patents. Now to actually achieve that, one has to have ways to represent many aspects of the real world, in all its messiness. Which is what the whole knowledge-based computing of Wolfram|Alpha is about."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. "Talking about the Computational Future at SXSW 2013—Stephen Wolfram Blog." ''Stephen Wolfram Blog RSS''. N.p., 19 Mar. 2013. Web. 17 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/03/talking-about-the-computational-future-at-sxsw-2013/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Algorithmic law ===
There have also been many attempts to create a [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] or machine executable [[legal code]]. A machine readable code would simplify the analysis of legal code, allowing the rapid construction and analysis of databases, without the need for advanced text processing techniques. A machine executable format would allow the specifics of a case to be input, and would return the decision based on the case.

Machine readable legal code is already quite common.  METAlex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalex.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[XML]]-based standard proposed and developed by the [[Leibniz Center for Law]] of the [[University of Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/425496|title=University of Amsterdam Digital Academic Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used by the governments of both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to encode their laws. In the United States, an executive order issued by President [[Barack Obama]] in the May 2013 mandated that all public government documentation be released in a machine readable format by default, although no specific format was mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. Office of the Press Secretary. ''Executive Order -- Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information''. N.p., 9 May 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine executable legal code is much less common. Notable among current efforts is the Hammurabi Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mpoulshock/HammurabiProject|title=The Hammurabi Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to rewrite parts of the United States legal code in such a way that a law can take facts as input and return decisions. The Hammurabi Project currently focuses on the aspects of law that lend themselves to this type of specification, such as [[tax law|tax]] or [[immigration law]]s, although in the long-term the developers of the Hammurabi Project plan to include as many laws as possible.

=== Empirical analysis ===
Many current efforts in computational law are focused on the empirical analysis of legal decisions, and their relation to legislation.  These efforts usually make use of [[citation analysis]], which examines patterns in citations between works. Due to the widespread practice of [[legal citation]], it is possible to construct [[citation indices]] and large [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] of legal precedent, called citation networks. Citation networks allow the use of [[graph traversal]] algorithms in order to relate cases to one another, as well as the use of various distance metrics to find mathematical relationships between them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fowler, J. H., T. R. Johnson, J. F. Spriggs, S. Jeon, and P. J. Wahlbeck. "Network Analysis and the Law: Measuring the Legal Importance of Precedents at the U.S. Supreme Court." ''Political Analysis'' 15.3 (2006): 324-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., and Daniel M. Katz. "A Mathematical Approach to the Study of the United States Code." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4195-200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., Daniel Martin Katz, Jonathan L. Zelner, and James H. Fowler. "Distance Measures for Dynamic Citation Networks." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4201-208. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses can reveal important overarching patterns and trends in judicial proceedings and the way law is used.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There have been several breakthroughs in the analysis of judicial rulings in recent research on legal citation networks. These analyses have made use of citations in Supreme Court majority opinions to build citation networks, and analyzed the patterns in these networks to identify meta-information about individual decisions, such as the importance of the decision, as well as general trends in judicial proceedings, such as the role of [[precedent]] over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Fowler, James H., and Sangick Jeon. "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent." ''Social Networks'' 30.1 (2008): 16-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses have been used to predict which cases the Supreme Court will choose to consider.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another effort has examined [[United States Tax Court]] decisions, compiling a publicly available database of Tax Court decisions, opinions, and citations between the years of 1990 and 2008, and constructing a citation network from this database. Analysis of this network revealed that large sections of the tax code were rarely, if ever, cited, and that other sections of code, such as those that dealt with "divorce, dependents, nonprofits, hobby and business expenses and losses, and general definition of income," were involved the vast majority of disputes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J. "Empirical Survey of the Population of US Tax Court Written Decisions, An." ''Va. Tax Rev.'' 30 (2010): 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has also been focused on [[hierarchical networks]], in combination with citation networks, and the analysis of [[United States Code]]. This research has been used to analyze various aspects of the Code, including its size, the density of citations within and between sections of the Code, the type of language used in the Code, and how these features vary over time. This research has been used to provide commentary on the nature of the Code's change over time, which is characterized by an increase in size and in interdependence between sections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Visualization ===
Visualization of legal code, and of the relationships between various laws and decisions, is also a hot topic in computational law. Visualizations allow both professionals and laypeople to see large-scale relationships and patterns, which may be difficult to see using standard legal analysis or empirical analysis.

Legal citation networks lend themselves to visualization, and many citation networks which are analyzed empirically also have sub-sections of the network that are represented visually as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are still many technical problems in [[network visualization]]. The density of connections between nodes, and the sheer number of nodes in some cases, can make the visualization incomprehensible to humans. There are a variety of methods that can be used to reduce the complexity of the displayed information, for example by defining semantic sub-groups within the network, and then representing relationships between these semantic groups, rather than between every node.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shneiderman, Ben, and Aleks Aris. "Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates." ''IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'' 12.5 (2006): 733-40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the visualization to be human readable, but the reduction in complexity can obscure relationships. Despite this limitation, visualization of legal citation networks remains a popular field and practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6704">The '''Council on Social Work Education''' (CSWE) is a nonprofit national association representing more than 2,500 individual members, as well as graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in this country.

== History ==

The Summer School of Philanthropy was founded in 1898 by the Charity Organization Society of New York and was soon followed by additional training schools for social workers in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Philadelphia. In 1919 the Association of Training Schools for Professional Social Workers was established (later the American Association of Schools of Social Work, or AASSW). It established formal accrediting procedures in 1932, although the American Association of Medical Social Workers and the American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers had accrediting processes in place for their particular specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1953|volume=1|number=2|page=1|title=[Accrediting] historical development|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 AASSW's move to limit its membership to graduate schools caused state higher education institutions to form the National Association of Schools of Social Administration (NASSA). NASSA representatives felt that social worker shortages demanded a more generalist approach to social work education. The two systems, however, frustrated the education community and resulted in the removal of accreditation authority from both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M. J.|last=Monti|year=2002|volume=50|number=2|pages=12–15|title=50th anniversary: Assessing council history and future|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move led AASSW, NASSA, and others to establish the National Council on Social Work Education in 1946. This group studied the issues and produced ''Social Work Education in the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=E. V.|last2=Taylor|first2=A. L.|year=1951|title=Social work education in the United States|location=New York, NY|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommended that a sole organization be founded that would permit the many elements within the social work profession to participate in setting and maintaining accreditation criteria. Thus, AASSW and NASSA were dissolved, and CSWE was born in January 1952 with the following statement of purpose: “to promote the development of sound programs of social work education in the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=K. A.|year=2002|title=Council on Social Work Education: Its antecedents and first twenty years|location=Alexandria, Virginia|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen R. Wright, dean of the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, became CSWE’s first president, and Katherine A. Kendall, who had worked for the Children’s Bureau, the United Nations, and AASSW, was appointed CSWE’s executive secretary.

In the beginning CSWE accredited only master’s programs in social work, because a perception existed—although it was not universally supported—that preparation for professional social work practice was the province of master’s programs. CSWE also accredited Canadian master’s of social work programs until the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (now known as the Canadian Association for Social Work Education) took over accreditation of those programs in 1970. However, CSWE continued to accredit Canadian MSW programs on request until 1983.

In October 1961 the CSWE board adopted Social Welfare Content in Undergraduate Education as an aid to higher education institutions that wished to develop such programs. In 1973, CSWE issued accreditation standards covering content in the social work curriculum, staffing, and organization of social welfare programs at the undergraduate level, and in 1974, the National Commission on Accrediting formally authorized CSWE to accredit baccalaureate social work programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1973|volume=21|number=3|pages=13–16|title=Standards for the accreditation of baccalaureate degree programs in social work.|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1974|volume=22|number=2|page=1|title=NCA and USOE approve move to baccalaureate program accreditation|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issued a revised curriculum policy statement in 1982 that included curriculum policy for BSW programs (CSWE, 1982). The CSWE Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards were last revised in 2008. Because CSWE’s focus has been on the quality of education for individuals intending to engage in professional social work practice, it never has accredited social work programs at the associate’s or doctoral level.

The CSWE is the only organization that provides accreditation for all online CSWE programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was originally based in New York City, moving to Washington, DC, in 1984 and to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1990.

==Conferences==
In September 2013, Darla Coffey, CSWE President, organized the first White House Briefing for Social Work Education coordinated through the [[Office of Public Liaison|White House Office of Public Engagement]]. Presentations were given by federal officials from the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''''East European Politics''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] academic journal covering the [[government]], [[politics]] and [[international relations]] of the post-communist space, including East Central Europe, the Baltic republics, South Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans, as well as all the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is published quarterly (4 issues per year) by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]])'''.''' The editors-in-chief are '''Adam Fagan''' ([[Queen Mary University of London]]) and '''Petr Kopecky''' ([[Leiden University]]).

== Journal information ==
''East European Politics'' publishes original scholarship on political developments in individual countries, together with cross-country comparative analyses and studies of the relations between post-communist regions and other parts of the world, including internationally based organizations such as the [[European Union]].

In addition to research articles and book reviews, ''East European Politics'' publishes thematic special issues as well. The journal also publishes regular ‘symposium’ sections and review articles devoted to briefer analysis of particular events, political issues and important theoretical and conceptual developments. All research articles in ''East European Politics'' have undergone rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and anonymized refereeing by at least two anonymous referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=fjcs21|title=East European Politics :|website=www.tandfonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
The ''Journal of Communist Studies'' was founded in 1984 by a group of scholars (Michael Waller, Richard Gillespie, Ron Hill, David Goodman, David Bell, and Michael Williams) with a shared intellectual interest in communist political systems, successors to an editorial team that had produced ''Documents in communist affairs'' (published in the early 1980s by Butterworths) and other publications dealing with the communist movement. While the journal set out to reflect the growing complexity of the communist world and movements, in the 1980s, its focus was on the ‘core’ countries and parties that had historically been part of the world of the [[Communist International]]. The primary emphasis was on politics, but history, sociology, non-technical economics, biography, and comparative studies also featured.

In 1992, ''and Transition Politics'' was added to the title to reflect changing realities. Following the change of title, the scope both widened, to embrace regime change and democratisation, and in practice also narrowed, to concentrate somewhat more on political analysis. The volumes published under the revised title included analyses of the politics and political science of the new democracies, several of which are now considered to be seminal works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=Adam|last2=Kopecky|first2=Petr|year=2012|title=East European politics (Editorial)|journal=East European Politics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the journal is published under the title ''East European Politics''.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary linguistics''' is a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]] that studies the psychosocial and cultural factors involved in the [[origin of language]] and the development of [[linguistic universal]]s.&lt;ref name="Croft 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234 | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken [[language]] leaves practically no traces. This led to the abandonment of the field for more than a century, despite the common origins of language hinted at by the relationships among individual languages established by the field of [[historical linguistics]]. Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} made in the related fields of [[biolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[universal grammar]], and [[cognitive science]].

Inspired by the natural sciences, especially by [[biology]], [[August Schleicher]] (1821–1868) became the first to compare changing languages to evolving [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Taub, Liba. ''Evolutionary Ideas and "Empirical" Methods: The Analogy Between Language and Species in the Works of Lyell and Schleicher.'' British Journal for the History of Science 26, pages 171–193 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree (''Stammbaumtheorie'') in articles published in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Schleicher| first =  August | title = Darwinism tested by the science of language : Free Download  | url = https://archive.org/details/darwinismtestedb69schl | publisher = Internet Archive  | date = 1869 | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stammbaumtheorie'' proved very productive for [[comparative linguistics]], but did not solve the major problem of studying the [[origin of language]]: the lack of [[fossil]] records. Some scholars abandoned the question of the origin of language as unsolvable. Famously, the ''[[Société Linguistique de Paris]]'' in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.
[[Joseph Jastrow]] published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 1886.&lt;ref name="Jastrow 1886"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jastrow J |title=The Evolution of Language |journal=Science |volume=7 |issue=176S |pages=555–557 |year=1886 |pmid=17778380 |doi=10.1126/science.ns-7.176S.555 |jstor=1761264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field re-appeared in 1988 in the ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' as a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]]. In 1990, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] published their paper "Natural Language and Natural Selection"&lt;ref name="Pinker Bloom 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|last2=Bloom|first2=Paul|title=Natural language and natural selection|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume=13|issue=4| year=2011|pages=707–727 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|url=http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~hoole/kurse/hs_evolution/pinkerbloom_bbs_13_4_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which strongly argued for an [[adaptationist]] approach to language origins. Development strengthened further with the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (subsequently known as "Evolang"), promoting a scientific, multi-disciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the ''Studies in the Evolution of Language'' series has appeared with [[Oxford University Press]] since 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Oxford Studies in the Evolution of Language | url = http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/language/sel.do | publisher = Oxford University Press  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from scientific journals.

==Recent developments==
Evolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly emerging as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. To what extent language's features are determined by genes, a hotly debated dichotomy in linguistics, has had new light shed upon it by the discovery of the ''[[FOXP2]]'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Scharff 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scharff C, Haesler S |title=An evolutionary perspective on FoxP2: strictly for the birds? |journal=Curr.

If both copies are damaged, the [[Purkinje layer]] (a part of the [[cerebellum]] that contains better-connected neurons than any other) develops abnormally, [[runt]]ing is more common, and pups die within weeks due to inadequate lung development.&lt;ref name="Shu 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shu W, Lu MM, Zhang Y, Tucker PW, Zhou D, Morrisey EE | title = Foxp2 and Foxp1 cooperatively regulate lung and esophagus development | journal = Development | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 1991–2000 | date=May 2007| pmid = 17428829 | doi = 10.1242/dev.02846 | url = | issn = | last2 = Lu | last3 = Zhang | last4 = Tucker | last5 = Zhou | last6 = Morrisey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, higher presence of ''FOXP2'' in songbirds is correlated to song changes, with [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] causing incomplete and inaccurate song imitation in [[Zebra Finch|zebra finches]]. In general, evidence suggests that the protein is vital to neuroplasticity. There is little support, however, for the idea that ''FOXP2'' is 'the grammar gene' or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Diller 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial dichotomy is the question of whether human language is solely human or on a continuum with (admittedly far removed) [[Animal communication|animal communication systems]]. Studies in [[ethology]] have forced researchers to reassess many claims of uniquely human abilities for language and speech. For instance, [[Tecumseh Fitch]] has argued that the [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]] is not unique to humans. Similarly, once held uniquely human traits such as formant perception, combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought to be shared with at least some nonhuman animal species. Conversely, [[Derek Bickerton]] and others argue that the advent of abstract words provided a mental basis for analyzing higher-order relations, and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies on cognitive architecture that co-evolved alongside language.

As it leaves no fossils, language's form and even its presence are extremely hard or impossible to deduce from physical evidence. Computational modeling is now widely accepted as an approach to assure the internal consistency of language-evolution scenarios. Approximately one-third of all papers presented at the 2010 Evolution of Language conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Evolang8 - Program | url = http://www.let.uu.nl/evolang2010.nl/evolang8program.html | publisher =  | date = 2010  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rely at least in part on computer simulations.

==Approaches==
One original researcher in the field is [[Luc Steels]], head of the research units of Sony CSL in [[Paris]] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. He and his team are currently investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in [[fluid construction grammar]] (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language. The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.

Some linguists, such as [[John McWhorter]], have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic [[communication]] methods such as [[pidgin]]ization and [[creolization]].&lt;ref name="McWhorter 2001"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = McWhorter | first1 = John H. | title = The power of Babel : a natural history of language | date = 2001 | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-4473-3 | oclc = 46564796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nativist" models of "[[universal grammar]]" are informed by [[linguistic universals]] such as the existence of [[pronoun]]s and [[demonstrative]]s, and the similarities in each language's process of [[nominalization]] (the process of [[verb]]s becoming [[noun]]s) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | date = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by "[[natural language]]" without attempting to address its emergence.

Finally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologists—among them Ian Watts,&lt;ref name="Watts 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] (co-founder with [[James Hurford]] of the EVOLANG series of conferences)—who argue that 'the origin of language' is probably an insoluble problem. In agreement with [[Amotz Zahavi]],&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zahavi A |title=The fallacy of conventional signalling |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=340 |issue=1292 |pages=227–30 |date=May 1993 |pmid=8101657 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight argues that language—being a realm of patent fictions—is a theoretical impossibility in a Darwinian world, where signals must be intrinsically reliable. If we are going to explain language's evolution, according to this view, we must tackle it as part of a wider one—the evolutionary emergence of [[symbolic culture]] as such.&lt;ref name="Knight 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Knight| first1 =Chris| title=The origins of symbolic culture| editors = Ulrich J Frey; Charlotte Störmer; Kai P Willführ| work = Homo novus : a human without illusion | date = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin ; New York | isbn = 978-3-642-12141-8 | oclc = 639461749| url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf |pages = 193–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experience''' is the [[knowledge]] or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in [[philosophy]] such as "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.

Certain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.

The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].

== Types of experience ==
The word "experience" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

Some wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
though one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.

One may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).

=== Physical ===
{{Main|Physical property}}

Physical experience occurs whenever an object or environment changes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s. They need not involve [[modal property|modal properties]] nor [[Mind|mental experiences]].

=== Mental ===
{{Main|Mind}}

Mental experience involves the aspect of [[intellect]] and [[consciousness]] experienced as combinations of [[thought]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], [[free will|will]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and [[imagination]], including all unconscious [[cognitive]] processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematicians]] can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. [[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Emotional ===
{{Main|Emotion}}

Humans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out) of love]] as "emotional experience". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence [[mate selection|mate-selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized [[mystical practice]]s such as [[sensory deprivation]] or [[mind control|mind-control]] techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], or [[mystical discipline]]s such as [[mantra meditation]], [[yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[dream yoga]], or [[surat shabd yoga|surat shabda yoga]]. Some practices encourage [[spiritual experience]]s through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with [[entheogen]]ic plants and substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[salvia divinorum]]'', [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, [[peyote]], [[Dextromethorphan|DXM]], [[ayahuasca]], or ''[[datura]]''. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves [[psychoacoustics]], [[binaural beats]], or light-and-sound stimulation.

[[Role-playing game]]s treat "experience" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many [[role-playing video game]]s, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called [[experience point]]s or XP.

=== Subjective ===

Subjective experience can involve a state of [[individual]] [[subjectivity]], [[perception]] on which one builds one's own state of [[reality]]; a reality based on one’s [[interaction]] with one's environment. The ''subjective'' ''experience'' depends on one’s [[individual]] ability to process [[data]], to store and [[internalize]] it. For example: our senses collect data, which we then process according to [[biological]] programming (genetics), [[neurological]] network-relationships and other variables such as [[Cultural relativity|relativity]] etc.,{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} all of which affect our individual experience of any given situation in such a way as to render it subjective.

== Immediacy of experience ==

Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has "[[wikt:firsthand|first hand]] experience". First hand experience of the "you had to be there" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].

[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].

Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].

== Changes through history ==

Some [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].&lt;ref&gt;

:"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of [[ideasthesia]], which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ''ideas'') about the objects that are being experienced.

=== Writing ===
American author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote an essay entitled "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]" (published in 1844), in which he asks readers to disregard [[emotion]]s that could alienate them from the divine; it provides a somewhat [[pessimism|pessimistic]] representation of the [[transcendentalism]] associated with Emerson.

'''Film preservation''', or '''film restoration''', describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, [[cinematheque]]s, and [[non-profit organization]]s to rescue decaying [[film stock]] and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeck|first=Joanne L.|title=Our Movie Heritage|year=1997|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0813524318|author2=Tom McGreevey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term "preservation" was synonymous with "duplication" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of [[image quality|quality]]. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|year=2004|publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=0974709905|url=http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film preservation is not to be confused with film [[Revisionism (fictional)|revisionism]], in which long-completed films are subjected to [[outtake]]s never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being [[Film colorization|colorized]] or converted to [[Dolby]] stereo, or minor [[film editing|edits]] and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]", and color film manufactured, in particular, by [[Eastman Kodak]], was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

90 percent of all American [[silent films]] made before 1929 and 50 percent of American [[sound film]]s made before 1950 are [[lost films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]|title=Film Riches, Cleaned Up for Posterity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/movies/15restore.html|quote=It’s bad enough, to cite a common estimate, that 90 percent of all American silent films and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 appear to have vanished forever.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Houston, P. (1994). Keepers of the frame: the film archives. British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized "moving images" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13139&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images] at UNESCO.org, 27 October 1980.

==Film decay==
{{see also|Lost film}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nitratedecomp.png|thumb|320px|An extreme example of nitrate decomposition.]] --&gt;
The great majority of films made in the [[silent film|silent]] era are now considered [[lost films|lost]] forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[film base]], which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Martin|title=Robert A. Harris Presentation on Film Preservation|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm|publisher=American WideScreen Museum|date=February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silent film]]s had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst [[History of film|film historians]].

Because of the fragility of [[film stock]], proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.{{dubious | August 2018 |reason=Vinegar syndrome article says the opposite.|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Film decay as an art form===
In 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]], and performed by his orchestra.  The footage used was from old newsreel &amp; archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the [http://www.sc.edu/library/newsfilm/ Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives] at the [[University of South Carolina]], and the archives of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Preservation through careful storage==
[[File:PackardHumanities Institute, Santa Clarita.jpg|thumb|right|[[Packard Humanities Institute]], Santa Clarita, [[Nitrate film]] Film Vault]]
The "preservation" of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from "restoration", as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"/&gt; For most film materials, the [[Image Permanence Institute]] finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with RH between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|last=|first=|publisher=The National Film Preservation Foundation|year=2004|isbn=0974709905|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

==Preparing a film for preservation and restoration==

In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the [[original camera negative]] or the ''composite restoration negative'' which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.

The composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the [[original camera negative]] is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a [[fine grain master positive]].

Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

==Film as archival medium==

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |title=twitchfilm.com. Jason Gorber's Cineruminations: 70mm, 4K, and THE MASTER's Split Personality Jason Gorber |access-date=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217215841/http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |archive-date=2014-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2012/November-1-2012/Sound-Picture-Restoration.aspx postmagazine.com, Issue: November 1, 2012, Sound &amp; Picture Restoration, By: Christine Bunish]&lt;/ref&gt; 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image resolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

==Digital as archival medium==

Digital scanners {{as of|2014|lc=y}} can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"/&gt; That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film {{as of|2012|lc=y}} ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

==Digital film preservation==

In the context of film preservation the term "[[digital preservation]]" highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital [[digital media|carriers]], as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to [[Digitizing|digitized]] or [[Born-digital|digitally born]] film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of [[digital curation]] practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prestocentre.org/ Presto Centre Project web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of [[George Eastman House]] Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Usai, Paolo Cherchi (2001) "The death of cinema: history, cultural memory and the digital dark age" British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the senior curator of [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediation]] of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, Giovanna (2009) "From grain to pixel: the archival life of film in transition." Amsterdam University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Enticknap, Leo (2012). "Dossier: Materiality and the Archive." The Velvet Light Trap, (70), 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

==Advancements==
In 1935, New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of [[D. W. Griffith]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} The Collection {{!}} Film and Media |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |work=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207232551/http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Henri Langlois]] founded the [[Cinémathèque Française]] in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |title=Passion Cinéma |access-date=2006-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627162200/http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of early silent films stored in the [[Library of Congress]], mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on [[paper print|rolls of paper]] submitted as copyright registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/earlymps.html#pape |title=Early Motion Pictures Free of Copyright Restrictions in the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |date=31 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, an [[optical printer]] was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films "showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/about-this-program Library of Congress-LOC Film preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film]] was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |title=Museum History · George Eastman House |publisher=Eastmanhouse.org |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006120017/http://eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Film Institute|url=http://www.afi.com/about/history.aspx|title=History of AFI|publisher=Afi.com|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, [[Dawson City]], [[Yukon Territory]], Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;Kula, S. (1979). Rescued from the Permafrost: The Dawson Collection of Motion Pictures. ''Archivaria,'' No. 8, Summer 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. (1990, Sept. 3). Expanding Archives: Library of Congress Is Not Just Books. ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Library and Archives Canada]] for transfer to safety stock and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/preservation/Pages/preservation.aspx The Library and Archives Canada Preservation Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] to make the delivery to [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Bill|title=Dawson City: Frozen Time|date=2016|publisher=KinoLorber|page=1:53:45|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 [[documentary film]], ''[[Dawson City: Frozen Time]]''.

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[National Film and Television Archive]] is the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of [[actuality film]]s commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in [[Blackburn]] in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections/about-bfi-national-archive About the BFI National Archive] at British Film Institute official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James Katz]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', and several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films), Michael Thau (''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''), and [[Kevin Brownlow]] (''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' and ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoleon]]'').  Other organizations, such as the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' and select [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]/[[Famous Studios]] and [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

==Studio efforts==
In 1926 [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] asked for [[film studio]]s to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an [[Eastman Kodak]] process, so that "schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Alva| authorlink = Alva Johnston|title=Films Put on Ice for Fans yet Unborn|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 October 1926|quote=Will Hays has sent a call to the motion-picture companies to search their vaults for ancient films of all kinds and for news reels of possible historic interest. The most important of these are to be treated by a process developed in the Eastman laboratories for making films immortal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard| authorlink = Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=076243418X|author2=Perry, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Warner Bros. retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948, in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. [[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as "a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors—[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be "used by over 100,000 educators nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

==Video Aids to Film Preservation==
The group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.

The VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.

==Obstacles in restoration==
Regardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.

Cost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at "several hundred thousand dollars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer "commercially" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.

Demand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Digital restoration steps==

Once a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].

The main defects needing restoration:
* Dirt/dust
* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]
* Color fade, color change
* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)
* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)
* Shrinkage&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Linear and "across the web" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of inflammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:
&lt;ol type+"1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.
&lt;li&gt;Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.
&lt;li&gt;Scan each frame into a digital file.
&lt;li&gt;Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix frame alignment ("jitter" and "weave"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.
&lt;li&gt;Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.
&lt;li&gt;Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Photochemical restoration steps ==

Modern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:
# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.
# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as "key" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.
# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).
# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.
# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).
# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.
&lt;!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)
Another important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.--&gt;

==Education==

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.&lt;ref&gt;Lukow, Gregory. [http://www.amianet.org/sites/all/files/ed_training_careers.pdf "Education Training and Careers in Moving Image Preservation"]. (AMIA, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.

'''Framingham State University''' is a [[public university]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]].  It offers [[undergraduate]] programs in a range of subjects, including art, biology, and communication arts, and [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[MEd]], and [[Master's degree|MS]].

==History==
[[File:Cyrus Peirce 1790-1860.jpg|thumb|[[Cyrus Peirce]], first president]]
As the first secretary of the newly created Board of Education in [[Massachusetts]], [[Horace Mann]] instituted school reforms that included the creation of an experimental [[normal school]], the first one in the [[United States]], in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], in July 1839. [[Cyrus Peirce]] was its first principal or president.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html Framingham State College – 150 Years in Framingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620132902/http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second normal school was opened in September 1839 in West Barre (the school later moved to Westfield) followed by [[Bridgewater State College]] the next year. Growth forced the first normal school's relocation to [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] in 1843, followed in 1853 by a move to the present site on Bare Hill in Framingham.

In 1922, the Framingham Normal School granted its first [[Bachelor of Science]] in Education degrees in conjunction with a four-year study program. Ten years later, with degreed teachers becoming the norm, the normal schools were renamed State Teachers Colleges.  The name was changed in 1960 to the State College at Framingham when [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees were added. At present, [[Master's degree|Masters']] of Education, Arts, and Science degrees are granted as well. In 2007, the college began offering the Master's of Business Administration (MBA) degree. In October 2010, seven of the state colleges became state universities, unaffiliated with the [[University of Massachusetts]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/186history/h04864.htm Bill Details – H4864&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] on July 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=818 Public Relations – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php Salem State University: University Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002323/http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In 2007, the school signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment. That year, Massachusetts issued Executive Order No. 484, which mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption for all state agencies and institutions. Greenhouse gases must be reduced 80% by 2050.  In 2010, the school adopted a plan to convert its heating plant to natural gas and to
convert its central chilled water plant to electric chillers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/documents/ClimateActionPlan2010.pdf|title=2010 Climate Action Plan|publisher=Framingham State University|accessdate=2010-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117100524/http://framingham.edu/presidents-office/documents/ClimateActionPlan2010.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Framingham State University was named a "Green College" by the Princeton Review in 2010 and 2011. It was one of 22 schools in Massachusetts to receive the distinction, and one of 311 nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framingham State named ‘Green College’ by Princeton Review |url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x401818403/Framingham-State-named-Green-College-by-Princeton-Review|publisher=Metro West daily News|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named to the list again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Guide Full List of Schools by State |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/green-schools-by-state.aspx|publisher=The Princeton Review|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Framingham State University is led by an eleven-member Board of Trustees. The governor appoints nine trustees to five-year terms, renewable once.  The Framingham State University Alumni Association elects one trustee for a single five-year term. Finally, the student body elects one student trustee for a one-year term. In addition to five full board meetings each year, which are open to the public, the board also meets in standing committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/board-of-trustees/index.html|title=Board of Trustees|accessdate=2010-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214064955/https://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/board-of-trustees/index.html|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University’s annual budget is $105 million, and the school has 775 full and part-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/about-the-president/index.html|title=About the President|accessdate=2010-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214064858/https://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/about-the-president/index.html|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[real estate development]] at the '''graduate school''' level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on [[real estate]] (e.g., [[MBA]] with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., [[Master of Real Estate Development]]) focused wholly on real estate studies.

Students who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals,  asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals.  Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.

While there are many real estate ''finance'' programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate '''''development''''' graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of '''real estate development''' (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.

==History==
Historically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While [[Business school]] programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the [[New York University]] Real Estate Institute in (1967)&lt;ref name="History and Mission of NYU Schack "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/schack/about/history.html| title= History and Mission | publisher= New York University | accessdate=2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the [[MIT]] [http://mitcre.mit.edu/ Center for Real Estate]. Soon after, other schools followed with [[Harvard University]] (1983) [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1984), [[Columbia University]] (1985), the [[University of Southern California]] (1986), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1989), and [[Cornell University]] (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

According to the [[Urban Land Institute]], during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate "was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, Teaching Real Estate Today, April 1992, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the early 2000s, prior to the [[Great Recession]], the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as [[George Mason University]], as well as additional coursework added by [[MBA]] programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As education needs have changed, business schools such as the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, October 1991, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate-level education rankings in the US==
Rankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. [[MBA]] programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' or ''[[Business Week]]'', but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Currently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ULI Hines Student Competition===

A separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]] [[Gerald D. Hines]] Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uli.org/programs/awards-competitions/hines-student-design-competition/about-the-competition/ |title=Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition &amp;#124; Urban Land Institute |publisher=Udcompetition.org |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from [[real estate development]] graduate programs. Students may also come from [[Master of Landscape Architecture]], [[Master of Architecture]], [[Master of Urban Planning]], [[Master of Urban Design]] or [[MBA]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ARGUS Software University Challenge===
An additional measure of the reputations of graduate real estate programs is the ARGUS Software University Challenge, which has been held in 2009, 2011 and every year thereafter. In the challenge, participating teams from universities around the world are required to simulate a comprehensive real-life development analysis of a fictitious [[commercial real estate]] project by modeling the provided assumptions specifically using ARGUS software. Team submissions are judged by a panel of industry and academic professionals. The winning teams receive cash prizes.

===Kellogg Real Estate Venture Competition===

The Kellogg Real Estate Conference and Venture Competition is hosted by the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research and the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative.  The Conference will provide industry and research updates and relevant market information.  The Venture Competition showcases MBA students, who have the opportunity to pitch to a high-profile panel of judges. The winning team not only receives $100,000 in cash and prizes, but also the opportunity to secure as much as $10,000,000 in equity funding. The primary purpose of the competition is to encourage entrepreneurial real estate ventures. The event also serves as an opportunity to promote top student talent before prominent industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/departments/real-estate/events-activities/real-estate-venture-competition/previous.aspx/|title=Previous Competitions - Kellogg School of Management - Northwestern University|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Real Estate Challenge ===
The National Real Estate Challenge, a 20 team invitation-only real estate case competition hosted annually by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, is yet another metric to compare graduate real estate programs. The competition tests teams from universities across the United States on issues regarding real estate finance and private equity. The event is sponsored by firms such as [[JP Morgan]], [[Equity Office Properties]], and Hines. The 19 universities that competed in 2014 included: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, Michigan, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, Rice, UCLA, UNC-Chapel Hill, USC, UT, Vanderbilt, Wharton, Wisconsin and Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/REFIC/Real-Estate-Challenge.aspx |title=National Real Estate Challenge |publisher=mccombs.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CASE at MIT ===
Arguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu/s/1314/clubs-classes-interior.aspx?sid=1314&amp;gid=175&amp;pgid=3053 |title=The CASE - MIT Center for Real Estate Alumni Association |publisher=aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu |title=MIT Center for Real Estate |publisher=mitcre.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.

==Undergraduate real estate education==
As with many [[MBA]] programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in [[geography]], [[urban planning]], business, economics, [[liberal arts]], architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.

{{See also| Undergraduate real estate programs}}

==Graduate real estate programs==
There are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the '''Master of Real Estate Development''', while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. [[Master of Real Estate Development]], [[Master of Science in Real Estate]], [[Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate]], Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.

Two examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:

===Master in Real Estate Development (MRED or MSRED)===
The Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: [[real estate development]], [[finance]] and [[investment]], [[planning]] and [[policy]], [[infrastructure]] and [[construction]], [[market analysis]], and [[real estate law]]. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Land Magazine'' School for Developers, c, D.C.: Urban Institute, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.

===Master of Science in Real Estate (MSRE)===
The Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a [[Business school]] into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate "project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-real-estate-infrastructure |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Carey School of Business |publisher=carey.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the [[University of Washington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.washington.edu/academics/masters-of-real-estate/ |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies |publisher=realestate.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Cornell University]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Coursework===
The course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize [[Harvard Business School|HBS]]-style [[case studies]] of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.

Example core curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |title=Academics - MRED - W. P. Carey School of Business |publisher=Wpcarey.asu.edu |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131326/http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real Estate Development Principles
*[[Market Segmentation]] and Analysis
*Real Estate Finance and Analysis
*Real Estate Development Project Management
*Advanced Real Estate Finance
*Real Estate Site Analysis and Design
*Public [[Entitlement]] Process

In addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |title=Real Estate Development - Academics - Courses |publisher=arch.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221010354/http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programs, such as the MS in Real Estate Development at [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://som.gmu.edu/real-estate-development/|title=Masters in Real Estate Development Program – George Mason University|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer students the opportunity to combine elective coursework from several disciplines including business management, public policy and civil engineering.

=== Design education related to real estate development ===
The practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts.  Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development.  A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.&lt;ref name="ap.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Master of Science specializing in Real Estate Development - B/a+p|url = http://ap.buffalo.edu/real-estate-development.html|website = ap.buffalo.edu|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. [[Executive education]] in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mred.auburn.edu/ |title=Auburn University Executive MRED |publisher=Mred.auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of graduate real estate programs outside the United States===

{{Main| Graduate real estate programs outside the United States}}

A number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in [[Graduate real estate programs outside the United States]].

==Nationally recognized research centers==
Real estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.

==Related graduate program offerings==
Professionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as [[city planning]], construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a [[Master of City Planning]], regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.

===MBA with Real Estate Concentration===
Business degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These [[MBA]] programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.

For those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! '''MBA'''
!'''Graduate Real Estate (MSRE, MSRED, MRED, MPS/RE)'''
|-
|'''Timeframe''' || 2 years full-time || 1 or 2 years; part or full-time
|-
|'''Curriculum''' || 1st year - Business Basics; 2nd year - Specialization largely focused on finance-related areas || Real estate focus and specialization throughout
|-
|'''Specialization''' || Real Estate in MBA programs is very rare. Specialization tends to be finance focused || Broad-based real estate education in design, management, law, development, economics and significant focus on finance, e.g., real estate finance, capital markets
|-
|'''Program size''' || Typically, the programs are large with real estate students representing a relatively small (2% - 3%) percentage || Small groups, with commonly 25 to 50 students
|-
|'''Industry Commitment''' || Students pursuing an MBA may not be committed to a real estate career; therefore they are seeking a broader base || All students are committed to the real estate industry and many have real-estate related experience prior to coming to the program. An important part of the programs are the learning between students.
|-
|'''Career opportunities''' || Varied but with a heavy concentration in finance-related areas of the real estate industry || Significant representation in project management, development, finance-related areas, acquisitions, entrepreneurship and government
|-
|'''Thesis''' || Generally, not required || Typically required, usually as a professional publication or a real-life capstone competition
|-
|'''Alumni network''' || Usually extensive, but predominantly outside of the real estate industry || Alumni are involved in all facets of the industry and located throughout the world
|-
|'''Recruitment''' || Limited recruitment by real estate companies || Many students seeking employment find opportunities through peers, professors or on-site recruitment
|}

====MBA real estate concentration offerings====
A limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.

Kapoor first came to prominence in the early 2000s through a series of influential journal articles on [[participatory development]] (the practice of involving beneficiaries of international development programs in decision-making).&lt;ref name = "kesby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a38326|title=Mike Kesby survey article on new participatory approaches in Geography|publisher=[[Environment and Planning]] |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoogleScholar"/&gt;  Kapoor is critical of such a practice, arguing that while it looks noble and promising (when adopted by the [[World Bank]] or any other international agency), it is often an excuse to further [[neoliberal]] policies, and can even result in authoritarian and exclusionary practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436590220108199|title=Kapoor's famous journal article, The Devil's in the Theory|journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |accessdate=2012-11-06|doi=10.1080/01436590220108199|volume=23|issue=1|pages=101–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Kapoor's critique helped frame an issue of ''[[Current Issues in Comparative Education]]'' (published at [[Columbia University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 2004|title=Participatory Development: A Promise Revisited|journal=[[Current Issues in Comparative Education]]|publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]]|volume=6|issue=2|issn=1523-1615|url=http://devweb.tc.columbia.edu/centers/cice2012/index.asp?Id=Past+Issues&amp;Info=Volume+6%2C+Issue+2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapoor's 2008 book, ''The Postcolonial Politics of Development'', is a collection of essays written between 2002-2007.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415773980/ |title=The Postcolonial Politics of Development By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="googlebookspcd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=IXGTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ilan+kapoor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq0sGV8PXYAhXR_aQKHfI4AIgQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ilan%20kapoor&amp;f=false/ |title=The Postcolonial Politics of Development By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=Google|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the first to analyze development issues from a postcolonial perspective. It has received many positive reviews.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt; Kapoor examines recent international development policy areas (governance, human/gender rights, participation), carrying out a cultural and political economy critique of them. He argues that development practitioners and western(ized) elites are often complicit in perpetuating contemporary forms of imperialism. The book concludes by arguing for the need for a radical self-reflexivity on the part of development workers, institutions and academics; while at the same time emphasizing the political strategies of marginalized groups that can lead to greater democratic dialogue.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

Ilan Kapoor is the brother of artist [[Anish Kapoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewidgetsonline.net/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=SdM95J3G5C++HWNBNmqW5A%3d%3d&amp;rand=2036086087&amp;buyNowLink=&amp;page=&amp;chapter= |title=Acknowledgements in The Postcolonial Politics of Development| publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter designed the book cover for Kapoor's 2008 book, ''The Postcolonial Politics of Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EnvDHjNaVIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Acknowledgements in The Postcolonial Politics of Development| publisher=GoogleBooks/Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Kapoor resigned as editorial board member of the journal ''Third World Quarterly'' (along with roughly half of the journal's editorial board members) in protest against the journal publishing an article making a "case for colonialism."&lt;ref name = "TS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/09/21/how-an-article-defending-colonialism-was-ever-published-is-a-mystery-roiling-academia-paradkar.html|title=News article, "How an article defending colonialism was ever published is a mystery roiling academia"|publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CHE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Revolt-at-a-Journal-Puts/241289|title=News article, "A Revolt at a Journal Puts Peer Review Under the Microscope"|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work on Celebrity Humanitarianism ==
Kapoor's most recent book is ''Celebrity Humanitarianism: The Ideology of Global Charity'' (2012).&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415783392/|publisher=Routledge|title=Celebrity Humanitarianism |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="googlebooksCH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=CTpd5oXI5LMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ilan+kapoor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq0sGV8PXYAhXR_aQKHfI4AIgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ilan%20kapoor&amp;f=false |title=Celebrity Humanitarianism By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=GoogleBooks|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the first to critically assess the relatively new phenomenon of global celebrity philanthropy (by the likes of [[Bono]], [[Geldof]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[George Soros]]). The author carries out a stinging critique of celebrity charity work and corporate philanthropy.&lt;ref name = "nationalpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-spectacle-of-charity-a-york-professors-new-book-accuses-celebrities-of-humanitainment|title=News article, "A York professor’s new book accuses celebrities of ‘humanitainment’"|publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how this charity is not just self-promoting, but also helps justify and worsen the global inequality brought about by capitalism. Kapoor also draws attention to what he sees as a new phenomenon of "spectacular NGOs," not-for-profit development organizations such as [[Save Darfur]] or [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] ([[Doctors Without Borders]]) that don’t just get celebrity endorsements but seek out celebrity status themselves. He takes them to task for being more interested in branding, spectacle and short-term results than addressing broader and long-term problems of social inequality and political inclusion.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Independent reading''' is a term used in educational settings, where students are involved in choosing and reading material (fiction books, non-fiction, magazine, other media) for their independent consumption and enjoyment. Students that read independently have an emphasized creative choice in what they want to read and choose to learn.  Usually, '''Independent Reading''' takes place alongside the ongoing curriculum in the classroom or [[homeschool]].  Independent Reading can be tied to assessment and evaluation or remain as an activity in itself. 

==More Names for Independent Reading==
*SSR: Sustained Silent Reading
*DEAR: Drop Everything And Read
*Voluntary Reading 
&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr038.shtml] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Some of the Aims of Independent Reading==

'''Students will'''
*Read more willingly and more often.
*Become more interested in the printed word in general, including their own writing.
*Become more receptive to enrichment activities related to their reading.
*Discover that they can think and write in a meaningful way about their reading.
*Learn that literature can enrich their lives.
*Expand their vocabulary.
*Receive higher test scores.

&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.k12reader.com/independent-reading-the-foundation-of-lifelong-reading/] &lt;/ref&gt;

==How to include Independent Reading into a Routine==

'''Teachers can'''
*Allot time each to independent, where the student will choose a book and read for that amount of time.
*Set a number of pages that students have to read by the end of a specific timeframe.
*Have a book report due where the student chooses and reads a book of their choice and explains it to the class.
'''Parents can:'''
*Set a certain amount of time that their child has to read.
*Have their children read them books of their choice.

The '''ISRO Satellite Centre''' (ISAC) ({{lang-hi|इसरो उपग्रह केंद्र}} {{lang-kn|ಇಸ್ರೋ ಉಪಗ್ರಹ ಕೇಂದ್ರ}}) is the leading centre of [[ISRO]] for design, development, fabrication and testing of all Indian made satellites. It was established in the year of 1972 as Indian Scientific Satellite Project (ISSP) in Peenya Industrial Estates of Bengaluru.&lt;ref name="age40"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/bangalore-news/bangalores-isro-satellite-centre-turns-forty-481967 | title=Bangalore's ISRO Satellite Centre turns forty}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAC has been renamed as '''U. R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC)''' after the former [[ISRO]] Chairman and ISAC founding Director Dr. [[Udupi Ramachandra Rao]] with effect from 2nd April 2018.

Situated in Vimanapura Post of [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]], the centre has recently produced and launched its 100th satellite &lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-launch-100th-satellite-today-a-look-at-space-agency-s-ten-achievements/story-WSNCAVHswR8XUsho2ie8vL_amp.html | title=ISAC's maiden century}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[INSAT]] series, the [[Indian Remote Sensing satellite|IRS]] series, as well as the [[GSAT]] communication satellites.

Organisations under the umbrella of ISAC include the [[Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems]] (LEOS) and the [[ISRO Satellite Integration and Testing Establishment (ISITE)]].
 
Dr. [[P. Kunhikrishnan]] is the current director of [[ISRO]] Satellite Centre ('''ISAC''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/sdsc-shar-chief-kunhikrishnan-appointed-u-r-rao-satellite-centre-s-director-118073101394_1.html|title=SDSC-SHAR chief Kunhikrishnan appointed U R Rao Satellite Centre's director|last=|first=|date=31 July 2018|work=Business Standard|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
Like other ISRO centres, ISAC is organised under Matrix Management Structure. The centre is divided into many Functional Areas like Control and Mission Area, Electronic Systems Area, Mechanical Systems Area, Reliability and Components Area etc. Each Area is further divided into groups. For instance, Control and Mission area has many groups like Control Systems Group, Flight Dynamics Group etc. Again Groups are divided into Divisions. For example, Control Systems Group has many divisions like Control Electronics Division, Control Dynamics and Analysis Division etc. Apart from this, Project Planning and Evaluation Group, Computer and Information Group, Space Astronomy and Instrumentation Division are independent, also facilities (like Thermovac facility etc.) and Projects (like IRS, INSAT,SATNAV, etc.) also exists.

The '''Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics''' (ITEP; [[Russian language|Russian]] Институт теоретической и экспериментальной физики) is a multi-disciplinary research center located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. ITEP carries out research in the fields of theoretical and mathematical physics, astrophysics, high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, nanotechnology, reactor and accelerator physics, medical physics, and computer science. ITEP also maintains an extensive educational program and organizes physics schools for scholars and undergraduates. The institute occupies part of the former estate "Cheryomushki-Znamenskoye" - a monument of architecture and landscape art of the 18th-19th centuries.

== History ==
ITEP was established on December 1, 1945, initially carrying the name "Laboratory №3", with the purpose of conceiving a heavy water nuclear reactor and cosmic ray studies. Developed of the theoretical part [[KS 150]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itepnew.itep.ru/index.php/ob-institute/istoriya/item/66-kratkaya-istoricheskaya-spravka |title=Краткая историческая справка |accessdate=2018-09-26 |website=НИЦ «Курчатовский институт» — ИТЭФ }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the years the institute expanded its research programme into high energy particle physics, astrophysics, medical physics and other related fields.

== Research ==
The school conducts original scientific research in several fields of physics and technology. Research areas in theoretical physics concentrate around [[quantum field theory]] including the [[string theory]]. Experimental research includes active participation in large international projects, such as the [[CERN]]'s [[LHC]] experiments, as well as smaller, national and locally managed projects.

== 2012 controversy ==
A large group of scientists at the ITEP are protesting about the Russian government's plan to merge ITEP with the [[Kurchatov Institute]]. According to them, the real purpose of the move is to effectively "kill" ITEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/russian-physicists-protest-government-consolidation-1.9921 ''Russian physicists protest government consolidation.

'''''Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence''''' is a 2009 book in English and Italian by [[Jane Fortune]] through the [[Advancing Women Artists Foundation]] (AWA) and published by The Florentine Press. It describes the history of female artists in Florence and their hundreds of works in the city's museums or storehouses. Contributing authors include Linda Falcone, Serena Padovani, Rosella Lari and Sheila Barker. It has twenty-six chapters on thirty-five women artists active in Florence.&lt;ref name="Fortune 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Jane|title=Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence|year=2010|publisher=The Florentine Press|location=[Florence, Italy]|isbn=9788890243455|edition=2.|language=English, Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was the basis of a five-part [[Emmy award]] winning television documentary, produced by [[WFYI (TV)|WFYI]] Productions, which first aired on [[PBS]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Women wins the Emmy|url=http://www.theflorentinepress.com/invisible-women-wins-emmy-award/|publisher=The Florentine Press|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

''Invisible Women'' discusses female artistic influence in Florence starting with the first known Florentine nun-artist [[Suor Plautilla Nelli]]. It describes the city as a center for women court artists in the [[Baroque]] period as exemplified by the teacher-student succession of [[Giovanna Fratellini]], Violante Siries Cerroti, and Anna Bacherini Piattoli. Other chapters highlight painters granted the honor of displaying their self-portrait in the [[Vasari Corridor]] such as the Venetian [[Giulia Lama]], the first woman known to draw and study the male nude from a live model, and [[Marietta Robusti]], the daughter of [[Tintoretto]] who was often called "La Tintoretta." The book covers still-life painters such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck|Maria Van Oosterwyck]] and [[Margherita Caffi]] best known for her elaborate bouquets with freely hanging wild flowers. Fortune focuses on six specific buildings in Florence including the Marucelliana Library, the Last Supper Museum of Andrea del Sarto, and the Gallery of Modern Art in the Pitti Palace. Other chapters include work on [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] whose admirers included [[Michelangelo]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]]; [[Lavinia Fontana]], the first female painter in Western Europe to reach the same level of professional acclaim as her male contemporaries; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] who created large-scale images of heroines; and seventeenth-century pastelist [[Rosalba Carriera]] known for her [[Rococo]] style and flattering portraits of the wealthy.&lt;ref name="Fortune 2010"/&gt;
''Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence'' focuses on oil paintings, pastels, watercolors, and drawings. The chapters are followed by ''The Woman Artists' Trail'', a map and an inventory of works by women artists in Florence, which was later adapted into the separate, pocket-size guidebook, ''[[Art by Women in Florence|Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years]].''

Producer Todd Gould and executive producer Clayton Taylor worked with Fortune and the AWA to produce a five-part television documentary. It describes a six-year project to research, restore, and exhibit works of art by women in Florence's museums and storage covering the restoration of works by three artists: Plautilla Nelli, Artemisia Gentileschi, and Irene Parenti Duclos who is the only woman featured in Florence's Accademia Gallery today. The documentary illustrates main themes featured in the book along with additional interviews with the Advancing Women Artists Foundation team, restoration experts, and executives from several museums in the United States and from the Polo Museale Florentino.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

WFYI Productions filmed the documentary which included footage provided by The Florentine Press, Artmedia, and Bunker Film. It first aired in the U.S. on [[PBS]] in [[Indianapolis]] on November 5, 2012.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

On June 1, 2013, the documentary won an [[News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award|Emmy Award as Best Documentary]] in the Cultural/Historical Program category.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12699">'''J. William Lloyd''' (never using his given name John) (June 4, 1857 – October 23, 1940) was an [[United States|American]] [[individualist]] [[anarchist]] from 1884 to around 1904. He was born in [[Westfield, New Jersey]]; he later moved to Kansas, then Iowa, then to experimental colonies in [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]], before returning to New Jersey in 1888.  He based his anarchism upon [[natural law]], rather than on [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as [[Benjamin Tucker]] did.  His first book, "Wind-Harp Songs" (poetry), was published in 1895 ("Anarchists' March," a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, had been issued by Tucker in 1888).  He founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free Socialists, in 1897.  His work, "The Red Heart in a White World: A Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope," formed the basis for it.  Lloyd later modified his position to [[minarchism]].

His life changed when in that year, reading Edward Carpenter while riding on a train to N.Y., he experienced "Cosmic Consciousness" (R.M. Bucke devoted a chapter to Lloyd in his 1901 book of that title).  This inspired his book, "Dawn-Thought on the Reconciliation: a Volume of Pantheistic Impressions and Glimpses of Larger Religion" (1900). 

He founded his magazine, "The Free Comrade," which first ran from 1900 to 1902.  There he championed anarchism, free love, Whitman ("Our American Shakespeare, and greater than he") and Edward Carpenter ("The greatest man of modern England").  In 1902 and 1904 were published his two utopian novels, "The Natural Man: A Romance of the Golden Age" and  "The Dwellers in Vale Sunrise: How They Got Together and Lived Happy Ever After.  A Sequel to 'The Natural Man,' Being an Account of the Tribes of Him."  

''The Free Comrade'' resumed publication in a new series, which ran from 1910 to 1912.  Lloyd now co-edited it with his friend Leonard D. Abbott, who financed its publication.  Between the end of the original series and the beginning of the new, Lloyd had stopped considering himself a pure anarchist, indeed joining the Socialist Party ("I am still anarchistic in the essential sense.... the great need of Socialism is a stronger infusion of Anarchism....").   Meanwhile his friend Abbott had moved from socialism towards anarchism.  They saw the new series "as an advocate of the juncture of the Anarchist and Socialist forces." 

Lloyd's writings appeared in [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]"; in [[Moses Harman]]'s anarchist and free love journal, "Lucifer the Light Bearer";  the anarchist and sex-radical newspaper "Fair Play"; the anarchist paper "[[Free Society]],"  Horace Traubel's "Conservator";  etc.   He had  a column in "Ariel," published by the Christian Socialist George Littlefield.

He wrote hundreds of poems, many of which appeared in anarchist periodicals.

He wrote many books.  Besides those listed above, they include "Aw-Aw Tam Indian Nights: Being the Myths and Legends of the Pimas of Arizona" (1911);  "Karezza Method," a sex manual (first published clandestinely ca. 1918); "Eneres," published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1929 and Houghton Mifflin in 1930, with an introduction by Havelock Ellis; and at least 14 other works, mostly poetry.

In "Edward Carpenter: In Appreciation," edited by Gilbert Beith (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931), Will S. Monroe wrote, "Carpenter's most devoted American disciple is J. William Lloyd, who did more than any other follower in the United States (Ernest Crosby excepted) to familiarize our countrymen with his doctrines."

He contrasted his idea of free love to that of "the artistic free-lovers, the Bohemians":  "My view of sex is religious, I might almost say, touched with austerity.  Sex and love to me are sacred and woman their priestess.  Sex should not be cultivated as a sybaritic indulgence, but with reference always to spiritual uplift, mental inspiration, physical health, individual fulfillment and racial progress-- always with reference to higher uses." (Free Comrade, July 1910). 

Lloyd supported the Allies in World War I.  He moved to California in 1922.  In the 1930's he promoted the ideas of Edward Bellamy.  But throughout his life he maintained friendly relations with former associates.  He died in 1940.

Though at times called a "drugless physician," Lloyd never graduated from the water-cure medical college he attended as a young man.

Archival material by Lloyd can be found in the Labadie collection at the [[University of Michigan]] and at the von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.

==Sex theorist==
A sex theorist, Lloyd strongly criticized patriarchy and sexual possessiveness and exclusivity. He viewed the historical fall of Matriarchy as "the great crime," and saw jealousy as akin to monopoly attained by legal power. He developed a concept which he called "The Larger Love."  As he wrote in 1929, "In my later twenties I conceived the most beautiful ideal of my whole life; one that has remained with me ever since, thru [sic] all the years, and which I feel is my special message to  humanity, my gospel and prophecy for the future....  The Larger Love, actualized, would be a state of human love- and sex-relation in which each human being of adult age, male or female, would normally have a Central Love, that is a mate who in loyalty, tenderness, reliability and fitness would fill the place of the mate in monogamic ideals, excepting that it would be expected and usually occur that each partner in this union would also have one or several Side Lovers, that is, close friends or mates of the opposite sex, whose affection might not express itself sexually, but could do so without any social surprize [sic] or reproach, and probably usually would do so, at least at certain times.  This whole group to form affectionally and spiritually a Love Family, or Love Group, socially recognized and approved as such, but not legally bound together in any way.  But as each side Lover would also normally have a Central Lover and center another group, it is plain that these love groups would be very closely intertwined and woven together."

His "Karezza Method" advocated sexual intercourse without seminal emission.   ("In the highest form and best expression of the art neither man nor woman has or desires to have the orgasm...")

In his Karezza book, Lloyd addresses such concerns as the question of semen buildup. He concluded from examples of sterilized men that semen is absorbed back into the body, if it is not let out.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1931"&gt;{{cite book

Lloyd openly questioned the trend toward viewing orgasm as purely beneficial. Concerning the male, he pointed to a standard stockbreeder practice to not let a bull or a stallion serve too many or too often so as not to devitalize him. This practical knowledge of businessmen to him was unbiased evidence on the effects of ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd observed that [[Coitus reservatus|karezza]] offered health benefits. For example, he said he knew it to “act like magic in painful menstruation,” and as a remarkable nerve sedative, even curing nervous headache. He also found it one of the best agents “for the benefit and cure of ordinary sexual weaknesses and ailments, including [[urethritis]] and [[prostatitis]].”

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In successful Karezza the sex-organs become quiet, satisfied, demagnetized, as perfectly as by the orgasm, while the rest of the body of each partner glows with a wonderful vigor and conscious joy … tending to irradiate the whole being with romantic love; and always with an after-feeling of health, purity and well-being. We are most happy and good-humored as after a full meal.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he was “willing to concede that where the intercourse is of such a nature as to cause a congestion that is not sublimated, or where sexual congestion occurs and sublimation and [karezza] are not available, the orgasm may have a necessary place.”

In Lloyd’s day, some people objected to karezza on the grounds that it would encourage excessive indulgence in sexual relations. He responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who do not use Karezza are vastly more liable to excess, and this usually from too frequent and intense orgasms, too frequent pregnancies, or too coarse, cynical and invasive an attitude. Where there is merely a physical itch or craving gratified, with no mutual tenderness or kindness, or perhaps actually against the desire or protest of one party, sex is always excessive.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lloyd offered many practical ideas for successful karezza, including the need for lovers to give in order to benefit from controlled intercourse. “Try to feel yourself a magnetic battery,” he advised.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As you acquire the habit of giving your sexual electricity out in blessing to your partner from your sex-organs, hands, lips, skin, eyes and voice, you will acquire the power to satisfy yourself and her without an orgasm. Soon you will not even think of self-control, because you will have no desire for the orgasm, nor will she.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karezza, said Lloyd, is the greatest beautifier because it increases and makes enduring heart love. He advised that to increase sexual control, “keep the spiritual on top, dominant—loving is the first thing, and at-one-ment … of your souls, your real end.” “Sex is very close to soul.… [It only satisfies] when it unites souls, not merely copulates bodies for a thrill.”

In a chapter called “Does the Woman Need the Orgasm?” he explained in karezza, the lady “melts” her whole being to her partner and there is not an orgasm in the ordinary definition of the word, yet beneficial physical relaxation also occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote that the full magnetic rapport of karezza occurs when:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two souls and bodies seem as one, supported and floating on some divine stream in Paradise.… This is the real ideal and end of Karezza. You will finally enter into such unity that in your fullest embrace you can hardly tell yourselves apart and can read each other’s thoughts. You will feel a physical unity as if her blood flowed in your veins, her flesh were yours. For this is the Soul-Blending Embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 48, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meltwater management''' is a runoff management system designed to deal with runoff caused by the melting of snow in colder climates. They were designed when it became apparent that using the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best management practice]] (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Cold_climate_impact_on_runoff_management|title=Cold climate impact on runoff management - Minnesota Stormwater Manual|website=stormwater.pca.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow filtration''' is a system to deal with left-over [[snow]] in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure [[road safety]]. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jay|title=Dump Snow in Rivers, Harbors? There's a Downside.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41427190/ns/us_news-environment/t/dump-snow-rivers-harbors-theres-downside/#.WQzRIcm1uRs|website=NBCNews|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In spring as snow melts, the salt used on roads as a deicer is left behind, which can be environmentally damaging as it creates a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment for plants.

The snow [[Surface runoff|runoff]] is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes [[electrochemical]] and [[biological process|biological]] processes, which bind [[heavy metals]] and [[nutrients]] to the sediment by means of [[redox|
reduction-oxidation]] reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of [[chlorine]] present in the runoff. 

The runoff then flows into a [[catch basin]], where plants use the salt [[ions]] (e.g. [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) for their growth.The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into [[streams]] and [[river]]s.&lt;!-- Plagiarism --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Microfadeometry''' is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/services/scientific-scientifique/microfade-microvieillissement-eng.aspx Microfade Testing Service], Canadian Conservation Institute. (2014, June 2).&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra.

== History ==
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early [[art conservation]] studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Druzik, J. Oriel Microfading Tester (MFT): a Brief Description. ''Research and Technical Studies''. '''2010''', ''2'', 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Ford, B. Non-Destructive Microfade Testing at the National Museum of Australia. ''The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material Bulletin''. '''2011''', ''32'', 54-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Before the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Chiari, G. Conservation Science Investigation. ''International Preservation News''. '''2010''', ''50'', 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Using a powerful [[xenon arc lamp]], 1 lumen of light is focused through an [[optical fiber]] onto a 300–400&amp;nbsp;μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5–12 years of display at normal museum light levels.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;del Hoyo-Melendez, J. Micro-fading Spectrometry. ''Fibers and Polymers''. '''2012''', ''13'', 1079-1085.&lt;/ref&gt; The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400–710&amp;nbsp;nm using a water filter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Arnaud, C.H. [http://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i13/Shining-Light-Art.html Shining Light On Art],  Shining Light on Art. ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''. '''2009''', ''87'', 44-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.
Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the [[Blue Wool Scale]].&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Lerwill, A. [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v24/microfading-questioning-basics Microfading: Questioning the Basics], Microfading: Questioning the Basics. ''Image Permanence Institute Bulletin''. '''2013'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards,&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

== Institutional Use ==
Cultural institutions that house their own instruments for microfadeometry are: [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Canadian Conservation Institute]] in Ottawa, the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the Art Conservation Department at Buffalo State College in New York,&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lighting/microfade.html Museum Lighting Research], J. Paul Getty Trust. (2010, July).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (United Kingdom).

[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A group of naturists at a [[nude beach]] in [[Crimea]], 2008]]
'''Naturism''', or '''nudism''', is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social [[nudity]], most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may take a number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:

: ''a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschênes|first1=Stéphane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=http://www.inf-fni.org/content/download/28259/1110928/file/Official%20INF-FNI%20Definition%20Of%20Naturism.pdf|website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|format=PDF|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
Several other terms ("social nudity", "[[public nudity]]", "[[skinny dipping]]", "sunning", and "clothes-free") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms "naturism" and (in much of the United States) "nudism".

People interested in social nudity can attend [[nude beach|clothes-free beaches]] and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a [[nudist club]].

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

[[File:Zwembad op naturistenterrein.JPG|thumb|Sign at a naturist [[swimming pool]] with a warning that no clothing (including underwear) is permitted.]]

The International Naturist Federation explains:

: '' "Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings."''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund für freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote "Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity.}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as "naturists".}} Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} in Britain there is a clear distinction.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American "nudism") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}

Nudism is the ''act of being naked'', while naturism is a ''lifestyle'' which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.{{efn|Ray Connett, Sunny Trails, in Sunbathing for Health Sept 1947 p 8, July 1957 p 14 writes that Naturism is a weasel word that can mean anything}}{{efn|Presently, [[Mark Storey]] is authoring an article detailing historical use of the terms naturism and nudism and how they differ between different cultures, countries, and time periods in history. In a telephone interview by Daniel Johnson on 15 April 2006 with Storey he stated that "a draft of the piece was posted on the "References" page of [[The Naturist Society]] [http://naturistsociety.com/ web site] for a few weeks". At the time of its former release in October 2004 it was titled ''Naturism, Nudism, or Nameless? A History of Terms'' He is planning on publishing a revised article as soon as additional information and errors are corrected.}}

In naturist parlance, ''[[wikt:textile|textile]]'' or ''textilist'' is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. ''the textile beach starts at the flag'', ''they are a mixed couple&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he is naturist, she is textile''.  ''Textile'' is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  ''Textilist'' is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}} ''Clothing optional'' and ''nude optional'' (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is ''clothing compulsory''; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases ''clothes free'' and ''clothing free'' prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.

The social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including "naturism", "nudism", "[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK)", the "[[nude beach|free beach]] movement" as well as generalized "public lands/[[public nudity]]" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.

==Personal and family nudity==
[[File:Carl Larsson Model writing postcards 1906.jpg|thumb|right|Personal nudity: [[Carl Larsson]], ''Model Writing Postcards'', watercolor, 1906]]

{{Main|Nudity#Private nudity}}
Many people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1948&amp;ndash;1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.{{sfn|Bancroft|2003|p=}}

&lt;!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images --&gt;
Gordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon &amp; Schroeder|1995|p=16}}

Barbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|2000|p=209-}}

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami et al|1998}}

Smith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that "the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}}

== Social nudism ==
{{See also|Exhibitionism}}

The rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with [[High- and low-context cultures|Hall's high-low context distinction]] and the [[Robert T. Francoeur|Francoeur]]'s hot-cool sexuality continuum.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}

=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Some clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares.{{efn|The three biggest centres on the [[Médoc]] are Euronat 335 ha, CHM 175 ha with a 3 km beach, and La Jenny 127 ha}} In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}

A naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France, naturist village [[Charco del Palo]] on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article|url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.&lt;ref name="PalmSprings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]]. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===
[[File:Chihuahua20 01 2007 2.jpg|thumb|A sign at a nude beach in Maldonado, Uruguay]]

Clothing is optional at [[nude beach]]es (or "free beaches"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Naturism and sports ===
{{see also|Nude recreation|Nudity in sport}}

Naturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]]  promotes recreational sports and is a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]).

=== Festival naturism ===
[[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|Naturist couple at the [[Nambassa]] festival, New Zealand, 1981]]

From [[Woodstock]] to [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]], and [[Nambassa]] in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festivals.

The series of 1970s [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.{{sfn|Jones &amp; Broadley|1979|p=}}'

[[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde festival]] in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.

Perhaps nowadays the biggest and most famous festival where participants spontaneously decide to go naked or take part in nude events is [[Burning Man]]: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/naked-restaurant-paris-park-bunyadi-nude-cruise-nudist-resort-hotel-greece-pictures-a7346721.html|title=Naked ambition: 5 ways to holiday in the nude|date=2016-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil wrestling by camp [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://activenaturists.net/gymnasium-camp/|title=Gymnasium theme camp|date=2015-11-07|work=Active Naturists|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer naturism===
The prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLellan | first1 = Josie | year = 2007 | title = State socialist bodies: East German nudism from ban to boom | url = | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 48–79 | doi=10.1086/517544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casler | first1 = Lawrence | year = 1964 | title = Some sociopsychological observations in a nudist camp: A preliminary study | url = | journal = The Journal of social psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 307–323 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Storm.

== History ==
{{Main|History of nudity|l1=Nudity in History}}
{{see also|Timeline of non-sexual social nudity}}
Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many [[culture]]s at all time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ |title=nudity as a social norm |publisher=active naturists |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of [[bathing]], swimming and in [[sauna]]s, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/ |title=naked sport events throughout history |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the ''hygiène de vie'' or healthy living.{{efn|"Le naturisme est la doctrine qui consiste à laisser agir la nature plutot que d'intervenir de manière artificielle".&lt;ref name="Planchon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Planchon|first=Jean Baptiste Luc |title=La naturisme, ou La nature considérée dans les maladies &amp; leur traitement conforme à la doctrine &amp; à la pratique d'Hippocrate et de ses sectateurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3ZEAAAAcAAJ|year=1778|publisher=Varlé}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known naturist club in the "western" sense of the word was established in British [[India]] in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a [[District Courts of India|District and Sessions Judge]] for the [[Bombay]] [[Indian Civil Service|Civil Service]]. The commune was based in [[Matheran]] and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an [[Anglican]] missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.{{efn|Crawford wrote a series of letters discussing his new club and its philosophy to the socialist [[Edward Carpenter]] between 1891 and 1892. In his letters to Carpenter, Crawford described his daily activities.

: "Calderwood and I were up at Matheran having two days’ holiday to spend naked from breakfast to evening [...] in June, Calderwood and I had a grand day. We went away to a bungalow in the [[Tulsi Lake]] without servants and spent from dinner time Saturday till 5 pm Sunday in nature’s garb".

The club's dress code required full nudity, with exceptions made for accessories such as rings and glasses. Members of the club had to be plainspoken about sexual related matters and all [[taboo]]s were consciously discarded. Carpenter suggested that a female branch should be added to the commune, although this was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Worlds-first-nudist-colony-was-in-Thane-and-this-man-proved-it/articleshow/16011435.cms|title=World's first nudist colony was in Thane (and this man proved it)|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to [[Ratnagiri]]; he died soon after in 1894.{{sfn|Farrar|2005}}

[[File:Koch, Max (1854-1925) - 1897 - Freilicht - vmp 01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Max Koch]]'s ''Freilicht'', 1897]]

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in [[Germany]] by Dr. [[Heinrich Pudor]], under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term ''Nacktkultur''. In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} [[Richard Ungewitter]] (''Nacktheit'', 1906, ''Nackt'', 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} Major promoters of these ideas included [[Adolf Koch]] and [[Hans Suren]]. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}

The wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, ''Freilichtpark'' (Free-Light Park), was opened near [[Hamburg]] in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}
In 1919, German doctor [[Kurt Huldschinsky]] discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure [[rickets]] in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26935867 10 inventions that owe their success to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept {{lang-fr|naturisme}}. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other European countries and spread to the [[United States]] where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the national federations united to form the [[International Naturist Federation]] or [[International Naturist Federation|INF]].{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.
From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same&amp;nbsp;– or better&amp;nbsp;– standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists.  More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Badstuga, efter illustration i Acerbis Travels, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|''Finnish Sauna'' (1802)]]
Naturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people.&lt;ref name="Carter2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Michael|title=J.C. Flügel and the Nude Future|journal=Fashion Theory|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=79–101|issn=1362-704X|doi=10.2752/136270403778052203}}{{subscription|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one definition. In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:

:: ''a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of social nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition" /&gt;

At one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.

The naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in [[Germany]] and [[England]], although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.

&lt;!-- moved from lead- needs integrating From Germany the idea spread to the rest of Europe and [[North America]] and beyond where a network of clubs developed. The model of [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German naturism]]  is to promote naturist family and recreational sports, with the [[DFK|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]] being a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]). [[France|French]] naturism developed on the basis of large [[vacation (travel)|holiday]] complexes. This in turn influenced [[Quebec]] and the United States. A subsequent development was [[tourism|tourist]] naturism, where nudist resorts would be built to cater for the nudist tourist, without any local base. This concept is most noticeable in the [[Caribbean]]. Nevertheless, most naturist activity takes place at local naturist clubs, especially in Western countries. --&gt;

=== Gymnosophy and religious nakedness ===
{{see also|Gymnosophist|American Gymnosophical Association}}

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers''. (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks [[Nudity in religion|practiced nudity as a statement]] that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the [[Olympic Games]] (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. 

Historically, the [[Adamites]], a [[Gnostic]] sect, practiced [[Nudity in religion|religious nudism]].
A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the [[Garden of Eden]], and God was displeased with [[Adam and Eve]] for covering their bodies with [[fig leaf|fig leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.

The [[Digambar]], one of the two main divisions of the [[Jainism|Jain]] religion of India, remain [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], or naked, though generally it is practiced by males.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. [[Wicca]]ns have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.

=== Naturist writers ===
* [[Elton Raymond Shaw]] was a [[Methodist]] churchman and publisher who wrote on the Body Taboo.
* [[Heinrich Pudor]] wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book ''Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft'' (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then ''[[Nacktkultur]]'' (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Paul Zimmermann|Paul Zimmermann]] opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[Richard Ungewitter]] wrote ''Die Nacktheit'' (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Adolf Koch|Adolf Koch]], a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from 'authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order. He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with Naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's ''Körperschülen'' schools.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Hans Suren|Hans Surén]] taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote in 1924, ''Mensch und die Sonne'' (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} Later, in 1936, Surén proposed physical exercise and naturism as a means of creating a pure German race and of beauty. In the early 1940s he was out of favour and arrested. By 1945, he had turned full circle and was writing religious texts. Though never a member of any FKK club he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|DFK]] in 1952.
* [[:de:Werner Zimmermann|Werner Zimmermann]] was Swiss. He promoted [[Progressive education]], encouraging naked [[Physical education]] to eliminate body guilt and to encourage openness that would lift the repression of the human spirit, which he saw as the cause of sexual deviation. The basic position was that the human body, in and of itself, was neither sinful nor obscene. This was adopted into the emerging philosophy that created the modern Western nudist movement.

=== Naturist ideals ===
[[File:Nude people at Praia do Abricó.jpg|right|thumb|Family in Praia do Abricó, [[Brazil]]]]

Individuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that [[eroticism]] and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:

* [[ecology|Ecological]] or [[environmentalist|environmental]]&amp;nbsp;— rapport with the natural world.
* [[Health]]&amp;nbsp;— bathing in the sun, fresh air and water ([[balneotherapy]], [[thalassotherapy]], [[heliotherapy]]). Sun is a form of medicine.
* [[Healthy diet|Diet]]&amp;nbsp;— Naturism has at times been associated with claims made for moderation with [[alcohol]], [[meat]], [[tobacco]], [[drug]]s; leading to a [[teetotal]], [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] lifestyle.
* [[Nude psychotherapy|Psychologically]] — rapport with other humans including equality and respect. Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; physically, intellectually and emotionally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;
* [[Spirituality]]&amp;nbsp;— nudity, well being and direct contact to nature helps feel closer to the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Pedagogy]]&amp;nbsp;— children should be respected as equals instead of being patronised{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Social equality|Equality]]&amp;nbsp;— clothes build social barriers. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Discussed in:{{Citation | last = Veltheim| first = Andrew| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Naturism: Naked Beneath Your Clothing| year = | url = http://www.parama.com/html/naturism.html| accessdate =2012-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturism and the romantics ===
[[Walt Whitman]] American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me... Nature was naked, and I was also... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nakedness and Nature|url=http://www.naturistplace.com/nudity19.htm|website=Naturist Place|date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Naturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of [[André Gide]]) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically [[Henri Matisse]] and other [[Fauvism|Fauve]] painters. This movement was based on the French concept of ''[[joie de vivre]]'', the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.{{sfn|Harrison &amp; Perry|1993|p=}}

===World Naked Bike Ride===
[[File:Naked Bike Ride - Holborn - 12 June 2016.JPG|thumb|WNBR passing [[Holborn tube station|Holborn underground station]] 11 June 2016]]
The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] and exercise in [[public nudity]], that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.

== Demographics ==
* In 1999, the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] commissioned a national survey on Canadian attitudes towards nudity&lt;ref name=fcnstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity |year=1999 |work=Federation of Canadian Naturists |publisher=Federation of Canadian Naturists |location=Ontario, Canada |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003072728/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which found that 8.9% of Canadian have visited or would visit a naturist facility. A further 11.6% have gone or would go skinny dipping in mixed company; that 39% go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists.
* In 1983, the Naturist Society in the United States sponsored a Gallup poll, which was repeated in 2000,{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} which found the following:

&lt;!-- Needs to be rewritten and sourced.
=== Croatia ===
Croatia has been an attractive naturist destination for five decades. Today there are more than 30 official naturist campsites, tourist villages, hotels, apartments, beaches and numerous more unofficial naturist bathing places.
Naturism is well accepted all along Croatian Adriatic coast. There are official naturist beaches which are sometimes within all naturist resorts and campings and sometimes there are special areas in textile resorts assigned for naturists. Often entrance is charged.
Then there are so called free beaches which are known to be naturist for many years, but not officially. Those places are mostly clothing optional.
And finally there are wild beaches where one can freely choose to be bare or to keep swimming suit on.
Naturist beaches are marked with signs saying "FKK" for "Freikörperkultur," German for Free Body Culture. Unofficial beaches are sometimes called free beaches. Croatia's naturist facilities often focus on different visitor categories, including families, adults, gays, and those where everyone is welcome. Beaches also often are sectioned into these categories.
Many naturist beaches (official or not) are within walking distance from centers of towns, villages or resorts. Many of the regular beaches have also a naturist section, usually at the end of the beach.
Croatia has long been popular for bare-all beach holidays, especially with German and Dutch nudists. Koversada, an island linked by bridge to the Istrian mainland, is the oldest among 30 official naturist resorts. All are indicated by "FKK" signs but there are also scores of unofficial strips.{{cn|date=November 2013}} --&gt;{{main|List of social nudity places in Europe}}

=== Finland ===
In [[Finnish culture]], nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, Terri. [http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/finland/qt/nudism_finland.htm "Nudism in Finland"]. ''about travel''.

{{main|Naturism in France}}

In 1903 la ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' published a report on [[Freikörperkultur|German naturism]] and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near [[Marseille]].

[[File:CapdAgde crop.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at [[Cap d'Agde]] mentioning that it is obligatory to be nude at this beach]]

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine ''Vivre intégralement'' (later called ''Vivre'') and the first French naturist club, ''Sparta Club'' at Garambouville, near [[Evreux]].  The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

[[File:Nude hiking in Gard.jpg|thumb|left|Randonue in [[Les Concluses]], [[Gard]], 2008]]

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the [[Île du Levant]] where they established the village of [[Île du Levant|Héliopolis]]. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on [[heliotherapy]]. and in that year opened the ''Club gymnique de France''.  In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the ''Club du Soleil'' with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]], in 1949 they started the magazine, ''Vie au Soleil'' and in 1950 opened the [[CHM Montalivet]], the world's first naturist holiday centre where the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] was formed.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

The naturist village [[Leucate]] and [[Cap d'Agde]] offers a different form of social nudity. [[Euronat (naturist resort)|Euronat]] is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10&amp;nbsp;km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy.&lt;!-- ref needed --&gt; France is represented on the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] by the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]].

=== Germany ===

{{See also|Freikörperkultur}}
German naturism was part of the [[Lebensreform]] movement and the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement of 1896, from [[Steglitz]], [[Berlin]] which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the [[:de:Naturheilbewegung|Natural Healing Movement]] were using [[heliotherapy]], treating diseases such as [[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[rheumatism]] and [[scrofula]] with exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[nude]] woman moves in a busy market in Germany, while other people carry on with their routine activities, 2005.]]

Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by [[Heinrich Pudor]], flourished.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}  Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}
It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with [[pacificism]].{{sfn|Hau|2003|p=}}

In 1926, [[Adolf Koch]] established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of "sexual hygiene". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0905-402, Ostsee, Sonnenbad.jpg|thumb|left|Young East German women at a naturist beach in 1988]]

During the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' era, all naturist clubs had to register with the ''Reichsbund für Leibesübungen'', which meant excluding [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Communism|Communists]]. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German ''sports federation'' member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.

After the war, [[East Germany|East Germans]] were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The ''Proletarische Freikörperkulturbewegung'' subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

=== Poland ===
First reported naturist society was established in 1897 in [[Grudziądz]]. In pre-war and post-war [[Poland]], naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were [[Zaleszczyki]] (in today's [[Ukraine]]) and [[Otwock]]. Under the [[communist|communism]] regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near [[Krynica Morska]], [[Misdroy]] and Dębki.

In the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in [[News media|media]]. As the [[pop music|pop]] song "Chałupy Welcome To" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 [[summer hit]] in Poland, the nude seaside locations like [[Chałupy]] or [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]] became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of [[lawsuit]]s, naturism became tolerated in selected "unofficial" beaches and distant spots.

Among the most popular locations are [[Misdroy|Misdroy-Lubiewo]], Grzybowo, [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]], Dębki, [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk-Stogi]] and Piaski.

=== Portugal ===
{{main|Naturism in Portugal}}
Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on [[Costa da Caparica]] beaches. With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of "indecency". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.

The ''Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo'' (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|title=Home &gt; About Us &gt; Who We Are|publisher=Portuguese Naturist Federation|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203081647/http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Slovenia ===
Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician [[Arnold Rikli]] visited [[Bled]] for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906)|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build [[spa]] centers which included [[light therapy]] and [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first visitors were most likely [[pilgrim]]s from Slovenia and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included [[sunbathing]] and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.

=== Spain ===

Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-25444&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20150428#a185|title=BOE.es - Documento consolidado BOE-A-1995-25444|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.

There are however some municipalities (like [[San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain|San Pedro del Pinatar]]) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of [[By-law|by-laws]]. Other municipalities (like [[Barcelona]], [[Salou]], [[Platja de Palma]] and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right ([[freedom of expression]], as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-federacion-espanola-naturismo-recurre-tsjc-prohibicion-nudismo-barcelona-20110717185055.html|title=La Federación Española de Naturismo recurre ante el TSJC la prohibición del nudismo en Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2011-07-17|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/la_buena_vida/tendencias/localidades-multan-vas-camiseta-calle_0_2300169989.html|title=Cuatro localidades donde te multan si vas sin camiseta por la calle|work=El Confidencial Digital|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In [[Vera, Spain|Vera]] ([[Andalusia]]), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturismo.org/adn/calendario.html|title=Calendario actividades 2017. ADN: Asociación para el Desarrollo del Naturismo de la Comunidad de Madrid|website=www.naturismo.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.

Textile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.

Legal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170811/43474195994/espanolas-topless.html|title=Las españolas son las que más topless y nudismo hacen|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the first official nudist club was established in [[Wickford]], [[Essex]] in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for [[British Naturism]] the club adopted the name "Moonella Group" from the name of the owner of the ground, ''Moonella'', and called its site [[The Camp (Naturism)|The Camp]]. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]]. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the [[English Gymnosophical Society]]. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an "aristocracy" of the original members, all of whom had "club names" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.&lt;ref name=bntimeline&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The history of naturism – a timeline |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019033149/https://british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnmoonella&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The Moonella Group |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201517/https://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}

&lt;!-- [[File:WNBR Brighton 2014 04.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in Brighton, 2014]]-- better image now used--&gt;
By 1943 there were a number of these so-called "sun clubs" and together they formed the [[British Sun Bathers Association]] or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the [[British Naturism|Central Council for British Naturism]] or [[British Naturism|CCBN]]. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called [[British Naturism]] which is often abbreviated to BN.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; BN is currently a [[company limited by guarantee]].

The first official nude beach was opened at [[Fairlight Glen]] in Covehurst Bay near [[Hastings]] in 1978 (not to be confused with [[Fairlight Cove]], which is 2&amp;nbsp;km to the east) followed later by the beaches at [[Brighton]] and [[Fraisthorpe]]. [[Bridlington]] opened in April 1980.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt;

== In North America ==

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing &amp; Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Most of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&amp;nbsp;– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1977 the [[La Fédération Québécoise de Naturisme|Fédération québécoise de naturisme]] (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the [[FQN-FCN Union]] as the official Canadian representative in the [[International Naturist Federation]] (INF).{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the [[American League for Physical Culture]] in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. Barthel founded America's first official [[nudist]] camp, Sky Farm in [[New Jersey]], in May, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ellensburg Daily Record, Aug 2, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932, AGA established the [[Rock Lodge Club]] as a nudist facility in [[Stockholm, New Jersey]] and [[Ilsley Boone]], a [[Dutch Reformed]] minister, formed the [[Christian naturism]] movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothesfree.com/history.html |title=The History of Social Nudism – Nudist History |publisher=Clothesfree.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism History of Naturism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002734/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |title=Body Acceptance: A Brief History of Social Nudity |publisher=Lupinlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234814/http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nef.oshkosh.net/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/Roberts_v__Clement/roberts_v__clement.html |title=Roberts v.

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) is the national naturist organization. [[Arnd Krüger]] compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (''Zuchtwahl'') were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.{{sfn|Krüger|1992|p=343}} The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- what's this mean to U.S. nudism? --&gt;

In 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists&lt;ref name="Florida Young Naturists FYN"/&gt; held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/top-10-reasons-to-get-totally-nude-at-the-florida-young-naturists-naked-spring-bash-nsfw-6424673|title=Top 10 Reasons to Get Totally Nude at the Florida Young Naturists' Naked Spring Bash|last=|first=|date=|website=New Times Broward-Palm Beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wreckbeach.org/archive/AANRWorldRecordSkinnyDipFinal.pdf|title=The AANR World Record Skinny-Dip|last=|first=|date=|website=Wreck beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, A new organization formed called [[Young Naturists and Nudists America]] which was mostly focused around the younger generation as well as social issues, such as [[body image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fallon |first=Claire |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/25/nudism-problems_n_7647806.html |title=Take It Off!

In 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism. The organization uses Arkansas law § 5-68-204 as a case study, but claims all anti-nudism laws infringe the constitutional right to assemble.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.UnconstitutionalArkansas.org |title=Arkansas Law § 5-68-204 Violates First Amendment Rights |publisher=UnconstitutionalArkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asia ==

Generally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Indonesia ===
In the seventies, nudity on [[Bali]]'s remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in [[Seminyak]] that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen Bali|url=http://www.unseenbali.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Nudism is considered [[taboo]] in [[Nepal]]. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many [[Hindu]] male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in [[Pattaya]] (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over [[Thailand]]. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 Nudity and naturism in Pattaya] Sawatdee Gay Thailand {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206045956/http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in social nudity ==
{{main|Issues in social nudity}}
[[File:Naturism.jpg|thumb|A naturist  &lt;nowiki&gt;''au naturel''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ]]
Naturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed [[sex]] nudity, [[personal space]], [[human sexuality]], [[gymnophobia]], [[modesty]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[vanity]], [[objectification]],  exploitation and [[consent]]. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; "[[nudity and sexuality|nudism makes me think of sex]]"; it is for primitive people or animals.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Naturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

Smith states {{quote|the main reason younger people are not becoming naturists is the inability of modern naturism to engage with the issue of sexuality. While it is true that "naturism became popular in Germany...as a healthy outdoor lifestyle", this lifestyle also included a recognition that, socially, nudity could sometimes be erotic. It was only when naturism arrived in a more sexually conservative Britain that sexual feelings were censored out to make naturism culturally acceptable.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}  }}  This statement is in response to the quote "The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? "{{sfn|Barkham|2007}}

Smith and King pose the [[Issues in social nudity#Sexual wellbeing|further points]] in their 2009 peer reviewed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

=== Issues for the naturist community ===
Many countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in [[Arkansas]] in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"/&gt;

Any social group is said to go through four phases:
[[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing]], wrote [[Bruce Tuckman]] in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:

* Naturist club isolation: established clubs excluding new members and rejecting new ideas.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* A family movement in a time of social change: a change in needs and expectations, away from one of a permanent commitment towards one of change and choice.
* Multi-gen preferences: each generation is a specific social group which needs to have its own norms that are consistent with common rules.
* Clubs vs. holiday centres: organizations with different roots find it difficult to establish common rules. The contention between those espousing a year-round commitment to an ideal, and those who see it as summer-only recreation. Club naturism is declining, while the number of people that assume naturist facilities will be available at any holiday resort is rising. The number of users of free beaches may exceed the number of people who wish to join a club.&lt;!-- Please add a statistic --&gt;
* Paid staff and volunteers: many clubs were established as cooperatives, but the values change when a few members put in the capital or work needed.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} This became more difficult when some members were paid to act as site managers.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* Infiltration by other groups: for many years clubs had strict "No singles" policies to maintain the family nature of the club.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Many other social groups practice non-family nudism, whether it be social singles, [[Homosexuality|gay]] naturists or [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]].
* [[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]: as unwelcome in a naturist community as in a clothed community.&lt;ref name="CCBN172"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264-0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk of being filmed in nude without permission, such as at nude beach. Such photos and videos can then be put on internet.
* Sunburn and skin cancer.
*Large numbers of clothed people visit clothing optional and nudist beaches and make the naturists feel uncomfortable, "like they've become a spectacle".&lt;ref name="abc2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Broome nudists in battle for beach as naturism declines | last = Parke | first = Erin | work = ABC News | date = 24 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-24/is-public-nudity-on-the-wane-in-australia/7653938 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc._Getn"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Get naked or take a hike, angry nudists tell 'lookie-loos' | author =  | work = CBC News | date = 21 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nudists-canada-overexposure-turf-war-1.3689094 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thes_Hanl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hanlan’s Point nudists want beach-goers to bare all | last = Botelho-Urbanski | first = Jessica | work = Toronto Star | date = 20 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/20/hanlans-point-nudists-want-beach-goers-to-bare-all.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An issue, a decade ago in naturist resorts like [[Cap d'Agde]] has been the clash between "fundamentalist" naturists and the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|échangistes]] who are sexually open &lt;!--(including those who do [[oral sex]], [[group sex]] or practise [[BDSM]])--&gt; on the naturist beaches and bars.&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Outraged villagers protest over open-air sex at naturist beach | author =  Kim Willsher | work = Guardian News | date = 7 Nov 2010 | accessdate = 28 Dec 2017 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/07/open-air-sex-nudist-beach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:

* Magazines published by an "official" national organisation, such as ''BN'' ([[British Naturism]]), ''Going Natural/Au naturel'' ([[Federation of Canadian Naturists|FCN/FQN]]), ''Nude &amp; Natural Magazine'' [[The Naturist Society|TNS]], ''gonatural'' (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as ''Naturally'', ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]'' and ''TAN'' (acronym of ''The Australian Naturist'').
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories&amp;nbsp;– these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}  (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content.  Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed&amp;nbsp;– they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)
Some naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

=== Photography, films and videos ===
Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.&lt;ref name=telegraph &gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards| first = Adam| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  Stark naked ambition| date = 10 May 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/10/ftnude10.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/05/10/ixartright.html | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]]}} gives a history of naturism, written in a personal style that attempts to use this type of humour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.  Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children.&lt;ref name=crowther1&gt;{{Citation | title = Gay reverend fined over 'indecent' images of boys | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gay-reverend-fined-over-indecent-images-of-boys-26300917.html | accessdate = 3 April 2014 | work = Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2&gt;{{Citation|title=Rector found guilty over indecent images |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193047/http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |archivedate= 4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocarroll1&gt;{{Citation | title = Paedophile campaigner walks free | work = BBC News online | date = 26 November 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516383.stm | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ocarroll2&gt;{{Citation | title = O'Carroll vs the United Kingdom | date = 15 May 2005 | url=http://echr.ketse.com/doc/35557.03-en-20050315/view/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by [[Spencer Tunick]], are done on public places including beaches.{{efn|Photography in public nude beaches

Nudists who visit public nude beaches may be photographed by [[street photography|street photographers]], [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]], [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] or other kinds of photographers without the nudists' knowledge and in the United States and most democratic countries the photographers have the law on their side as no individual has an [[expectation of privacy]] in a [[public place]] and photographers are not required to have the naturists' consent before photographing them or publishing and selling the pictures or videos.{{sfn|NJ|2011}} In many countries there exist private nudist areas in which photography is not allowed and naturists who wish to not be photographed can enjoy their activities there. However, naturists who wish to not be photographed in public nude beaches have found various ways to make the photographers leave the beach, such as photographing the photographer and publishing such photos.

Some nude beaches provide fences that block the view from nearby streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g147317-d155079-i25617439-Club_Ambiance-Runaway_Bay_Saint_Ann_Parish_Jamaica.html Trip Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph needs to be developed expanded and floated as a separate page --&gt;
&lt;!-- Needs ref and maybe a naturist magazines list page --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Terminology==
* ''Clothist'' is a term describing someone who does not practice social nudity.-- Is there a reference for this term?-- Never heard it used in Europe. Supported by Korky Day
* ''[[Gymnophobia]]'' is an irrational fear or anxiety about being seen naked, or about seeing others naked.

=== Humour ===
* A ''cottontail'' is a term describing someone whose [[buttocks]] are paler than his or her legs and back, caused by [[sun tanning]] while wearing a swimsuit. (US specific)
* In uniform, ie nude.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}
* A ''[[acomoclitism|shaved]]'' individual or ''smoothie'' is one who shaves off much of his/her body hair, including the pubic hair. This is so common now- does the word still exist? It sounds derogatory
* ''[[Topfree]]'' means bare-chested (leaving chest and breasts uncovered), or a place that allows uncovered female and male chests. The term was coined by activists to use instead of the term "topless", which has a negative connotation to some, in part because it is used by strip clubs. Naturist women felt they'd rather be "free" than "less". Topless is also used. Is this not a historical term that is no longer current? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Recent research has begun to explore this complex and historical relationship while highlighting how erotic experiences within naturism may actually enhance sexual wellbeing and be a positive force within naturism.&lt;ref name=smithking/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- {{POV-statement|date=November 2008}} Summary of chapter 1, of Descamps which is referenced above-- this subsection is about opinions- please suggest  better wording on the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of Nikki Craft- and her display of disturbing links --&gt;
&lt;!-- Those inexperienced in social nudity often say that they fear that it contributes to an imbalance of power between men and women. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They say that women and children are more vulnerable when nude, and can be exploited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} While that might be true in a situation of commercial nudity, such as a strip club, women advocates of social nudity assert the opposite, especially in an established nude group. The men are nude there as well, no money is changing hands, nor is anyone in any sense giving a "performance". No one pays to be nude and no one is being paid to be nude. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Padding --&gt;
&lt;!-- Move to new page: * [[Arkansas]], which calls itself "The Natural State" on its licence plates, has made it illegal for people to advocate nudism under code 5-68-204 section C which states:
: "''It is unlawful for any:
: ''(1)  Person, club, camp, corporation, partnership, association, or organization to advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism; or  ''
: ''(2)  Person to rent, lease, or otherwise permit his or her land, premises, or buildings to be used for the purpose of advocating, demonstrating, or promoting nudism.''" its none too easy to do in Saudi Arabia either --&gt;
&lt;!-- Some people believe that the naked human body is to be accepted, respected, cherished, and enjoyed. They believe it is not inherently shameful, corrupting, degrading, or dangerous. Many of them enjoy clothes free activities. They reject views that being naked with other people is morally wrong ([[indecent exposure|indecent]]), [[sexual]] ''per se'' ([[erotic]] or [[pornographic]]). They argue that nakedness is a healthy, [[nature|natural]] state, that being nude is to be in the purest form, since everyone was [[birth|born]] nude. They generally find that they quickly become so accustomed to being nude among nudes that it no longer seems very remarkable. It is, rather, simply one part of their [[lifestyle]].
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Practitioners say that they are not pruriently interested in seeing others naked (which, if for sexual pleasure, is called [[voyeurism]]) or in being seen naked by others (likewise: [[exhibitionism]]). --&gt;

A '''pattern language''' is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise. The term was coined by architect [[Christopher Alexander]] and popularized by his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.

A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. Aliveness is one placeholder term for "the quality that has no name": a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Christopher |title=The Timeless Way of Building |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-502402-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates{{who|date=March 2016}} of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.

==What is a pattern?==
{{See also|Design pattern}}
When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the [[syntax]]), and use (the [[grammar]]) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Each such entry is a single [[design pattern]]. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern's contexts.

Elemental or universal ''patterns'' such as "door" or "partnership" are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, J. [http://www.synapse9.com/pub/2015_PURPLSOC-JLHfinalpub.pdf Guiding Patterns of Naturally Occurring Design: Elements. PURPLSOC 2015 proceedings, July 3-5 2015 Krems, Austria] PURPLSOC meeting on the many open scientific questions, e.g. regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all languages, a pattern language has [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[grammar]] – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
* The language description – the ''vocabulary'' – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called ''design patterns''. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
* Each solution includes ''syntax'', a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
* The solution includes ''grammar'' that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
* In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander's book ''A Pattern Language'', the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
* The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside.

==Many patterns form a language==
Just as [[words]] must have [[Grammar|grammatical]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] relationships to each other in order to make a spoken [[language]] useful, design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language. Christopher Alexander's work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. Occasionally, the smaller problems have no solution, and a different larger solution must be selected. Eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders, and the "design" is done.

The actual organizational structure ([[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Iterative method|iterative]], etc.) is left to the discretion of the designer, depending on the problem. This explicitly lets a designer explore a design, starting from some small part. When this happens, it's common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution. At this point, the design almost always becomes a better design.

In the language, therefore, each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole. This gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved.

The most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, empowered users,&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Christopher, The Oregon Project&lt;/ref&gt; as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to empower users of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.

==Design problems in a context==
An important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system (that may be a house, a computer program or an object of daily use), and to assist in the design of future systems. The idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context, but still specific enough to give constructive guidance.

The range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context. An important part in each pattern is to describe this context. Examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation.

For instance, Alexander's pattern "A PLACE TO WAIT" addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery, while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions. The [[Design Patterns|"Gang-of-Four" book ''Design Patterns'']] by Gamma et al. proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language, and the program's application domain.

Still, the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side, and specificity on the other side. In the end this depends on the author's preferences. However, even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are, by nature, absolutely concrete and specific.

Patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world. Alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero, one or two stars, indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples. It is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples. It is, however, conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern-like format.

The patterns in Alexander's book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood, others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms. Alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world, so they can be connected to a [[#Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)|hierarchic network]].

===Balancing of forces===
A pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve, the context or situation where these problems arise, and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended.

Often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or "forces". A pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision.

For instance, there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone. The forces would be the need to communicate, and the need to get other things done at the same time (cooking, inspecting the bookshelf). A very specific pattern would be just "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". More general patterns would be "WIRELESS DEVICE" or "SECONDARY ACTIVITY", suggesting that a secondary activity (such as talking on the phone, or inspecting the pockets of your jeans) should not interfere with other activities.

Though quite unspecific in its context, the forces in the "SECONDARY ACTIVITY" pattern are very similar to those in "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". Thus, the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern.

===Patterns contain their own rationale===
Usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values. For Christopher Alexander, it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture. One of his key values is making these people feel more alive. He talks about the "quality without a name" (QWAN).

More generally, we could say that a good system should be accepted, welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it, or – even better – by all people it affects. For instance, when discussing a street café, Alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest, but also mentions people who just walk by.

The same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars, to social structures like a team working on a project, or to the user interface of a computer program. The qualities of a software system, for instance, could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system.

By focusing on the impacts on human life, we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology, and thus find "timeless quality" (Alexander).

==Generic structure and layout==
Usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains, breaking each into generic sections like context, problem statement, solution etc.

Christopher Alexander's patterns, for instance, each consist of a short name, a rating (up to two '*' symbols), a sensitizing picture, the context description, the problem statement, a longer part of text with examples and explanations, a solution statement, a sketch and further references. This structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the "Alexandrian form".

Alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns. For instance, the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font, the latter is always preceded by the "Therefore:" keyword. Some authors instead use explicit labels, which creates some degree of redundancy.

===Meaningful names===
When design is done by a team, pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share. This makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive. Some examples from Alexander's works are WINDOW PLACE (helps define where windows should go in a room) and A PLACE TO WAIT (helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms, for example).

==Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)==
A pattern language, as conceived by Alexander, contains links from one pattern to another, so when trying to apply one pattern in a project, a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context.

In Alexander's book, such links are collected in the "references" part, and echoed in the linked pattern's "context" part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph. A pattern that is linked to in the "references" usually addresses a problem of lower scale, that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem. For instance, the "PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM" pattern has a reference to "STAIR SEATS".

Even without the pattern description, these links, along with meaningful names, carry a message: When building a place outside where people can spend time ("PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM"), consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ("STAIR SEATS"). If you are planning an office ("WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES"), consider to arrange workspaces in small groups ("SMALL WORKING GROUPS"). Alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves.

The links in Alexander's book clearly result in a hierarchic network. Alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern ''language''.

The idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors, though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary. Some authors, however, like Gamma et al. in ''[[Design Patterns]]'', make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns. In such a case we would speak of a ''pattern catalogue'' rather than a ''pattern language''.&lt;ref name="dearden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andy Dearden, Janet Finlay | title = Pattern Languages in HCI: A critical review | date = January 2006 | journal = Human Computer Interaction | volume = 21 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own. In order to enable this, his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering; he also explains the general method of pattern languages. The original concept for the book ''A Pattern Language'' was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder, so that pages could easily be added later; this proved impractical in publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory
Symposium 2009, presentation by 4 of 6 original authors of ''A Pattern Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields. Some examples are [[Design pattern (architecture)|architectural patterns]], [[Design pattern (computer science)|computer science patterns]], [[interaction design pattern]]s, [[pedagogical patterns]],  social action patterns, and group facilitation patterns. The pattern language approach has also been recommended as a way to promote [[civic intelligence]] by helping to coordinate actions for diverse people and communities who are working together on significant shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;For additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments, see: {{cite web |last=Schuler |first=Douglas |url=http://publicsphereproject.org/sites/default/files/Critical%20Enablers%20of%20Civic%20Intelligence.reduced.pdf |title=Choosing success: pattern languages as critical enablers of civic intelligence |publisher=Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory Conference, Portland, OR, 2009 |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential, and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields.

It is important to note that notations such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or the [[flowchart]] symbol collection are not pattern languages. They could more closely be compared to an alphabet: their symbols could be used to document a pattern language, but they are not a language by themselves. A [[recipe]] or other sequential set of steps to be followed, with only one correct path from start to finish, is also not a pattern language. However, the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language.

===Simple example of a pattern===
*''Name'': ChocolateChipRatio
*''Context'': You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
*''Consider these patterns first'': SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
*''Problem'': Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
*''Solution'': Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.
*''Consider next'': NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod

==Origin==
[[Christopher Alexander]], an architect and author, coined the term pattern language.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], USA | isbn = 0-19-501919-9 | last = Alexander | first = Christopher | title = A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction | year = 1977 | page = 1216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to refer to common problems of the [[design]] and [[construction]] of buildings and towns and how they should be solved. The solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room.

The framework and philosophy of the "pattern language" approach was initially popularized in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' that was written by Christopher Alexander and five colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California in the late 1970s. While ''A Pattern Language'' contains 253 "patterns" from the first pattern, "Independent Regions" (the most general) to the last, "Things from Your Life", Alexander's book ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work. The following definitions of "pattern" and "pattern language" are paraphrased from ''A Pattern Language''&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;:

"A ''pattern'' is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context, describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;

A ''pattern language'' is a network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions.

== Application domains ==
Christopher Alexander's idea has been adopted in other disciplines, often much more heavily than the original [[Pattern (architecture)|application of patterns to architecture]] as depicted in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt; Recent examples include [[software design pattern]]s in software engineering and, more generally, [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural patterns in computer science]], as well as [[interaction design pattern]]s. [[Pedagogical patterns]] are used to document good practices in teaching. The book ''Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution'', containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability, democracy and positive social change, was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/ |title=Liberating Voices Pattern Language |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deck "Group Works: A Pattern Language for Bringing Life to Meetings and Other Gatherings" was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groupworksdeck.org/ |title=Group Pattern Language Project |website=groupworksdeck.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, patterns were also introduced into [[systems architecture]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Adopting Patterns for Space Mission and Space Systems Architecting|url=https://www.academia.edu/2110976/A.M._Hein_Adopting_Patterns_for_Space_Mission_and._Space_Systems_Architecting_|work=5 th International Workshop on System &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space ApplicationsSECESA 2012|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Project Icarus: Stakeholder Scenarios for an Interstellar Exploration Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/1354848/PROJECT_ICARUS_STAKEHOLDER_SCENARIOS_FOR_AN_INTERSTELLAR_EXPLORATION_PROGRAM|work=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 64, 224-233, 2011|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cloutier|first=Robert|title=The Concept of Reference Architectures|url=http://www.calimar.com/TheConceptOfReferenceArchitectures.pdf|work=Systems Engineering Vol. 13, No. 1, 2010|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chess]] [[Chess strategy|strategy]] and [[Chess tactics|tactics]] involve many patterns from [[Chess opening|opening]] to [[checkmate]].

[[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[wiki]], coauthored a paper with [[Michael Mehaffy]] arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages, and that wikis "were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on [[Pattern Languages of Programs]], October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plasma Cutter.jpg|thumb|A plasma torch cutter]]
A '''plasma torch''' (also known as a '''plasma arc''', '''plasma gun''', or '''plasma cutter''', '''plasmatron''') is a device for generating a directed flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jeffus | first1 = Larry F. | title = Welding: principles and applications | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2002 | pages = 180 | isbn = 978-1-4018-1046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szałatkiewicz | first1 = J. | title = Safety and intelligent control system for plasmatron application | doi = 10.5604/01.3001.0010.2942 | journal = Journal of KONES Powertrain and Transport | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 6 | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = |url= http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/23.1/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.23.No.1.277-281.pdf | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plasma jet can be used for applications including [[plasma cutting]], [[plasma arc welding]], [[plasma spraying]], and [[plasma gasification]] for waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szałatkiewicz | first1 = J. | title = Energy Recovery from Waste of Printed Circuit Boards in Plasmatron Plasma Reactor | doi = | journal = Polish Journal of Environmental Studies | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 5 | year = 2014 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = |url= http://kones.eu/ep/2017/vol24/no2/247-252_J_O_KONES_2017_NO._2,_VOL._24,_ISSN1231-4005_SZALATKIEWICZ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of thermal plasma torches==
[[Plasma (physics)#Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas|Thermal plasmas]] are generated in plasma torches by [[direct current]] (DC), [[alternating current]] (AC), [[radio-frequency]] (RF) and other discharges. DC torches are the most commonly used and researched, because when compared to AC: “there is less flicker generation and noise, a more stable operation, better control, a minimum of two electrodes, lower electrode consumption, slightly lower refractory [heat] wear and lower power consumption”.&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.04.017 |author=Gomez, E. |author2=Rani, D.A. |author3=Cheeseman, C.R. |author4=Deegan, D. |author5=Wise, M. |author6=Boccaccini, A.R. |date=2009 |title=Thermal plasma technology for the treatment of wastes: A critical review |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=161 |issue=2–3 |pages=614–626 |pmid=18499345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal plasma DC torches, non-transferred arc, based on hot cathode===
[[File:Non-transferred DC plasma torch.png|800px|Cross-sectional representation of a non-transferred DC plasma torch. Showing the pointed cathode and annular anode. The inlets and outlets of the water-cooling system are labelled, note that the arc temperature can be up to 15 000°C. The plasma arc is drawn for illustration purposes only. Not to scale.]]

In a DC torch, the [[Plasma (physics)#Generation of artificial plasma|electric arc]] is formed between the [[electrodes]] (which can be made of copper, [[tungsten]], [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]], silver etc.), and the thermal plasma is formed from the continual input of carrier/working gas, projecting outward as a plasma jet/flame (as can be seen on the right). In DC torches, the carrier gas can be, for example, either oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, air, or hydrogen;&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; and although termed as such, it does not have to be a gas (thus, better termed a carrier fluid).

For example, a research plasma torch at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) in Prague, Czech Republic, functions with an [[H2O|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] vortex (as well as a small addition of argon to ignite the arc), and produces a high temperature/velocity plasma flame.&lt;ref name=Hrabovsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hrabovský|first=Milan|author2=Kopecky, V.|author3= Sember, V.|author4=  Kavka, T.|author5=   Chumak, O.|author6=    Konrad, M.|title=Properties of Hybrid Water/Gas DC Arc Plasma Torch|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|date=August 2006|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1566–1575|bibcode = 2006ITPS...34.1566H |doi = 10.1109/TPS.2006.878365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, early studies of arc stabilization employed a water-vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavka|first=T|author2=Chumak, O. |author3=Sember, V. |author4=Hrabovsky, M. |title=Processes in Gerdien arc generated by hybrid gas-water torch|journal=28th ICPIG|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the electrode materials and carrier fluids have to be specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and function.

Furthermore, the flow-rate of the carrier gas can be raised to promote a larger, more projecting plasma jet, provided that the arc current is sufficiently increased; and vice versa.

The plasma flame of a real plasma torch is a few inches long at most; it is to be distinguished from [[Plasma weapon (fiction)|fictional long-range plasma weapons]].

====Transferred vs. non-transferred====
It is important to note that there are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in transferred—one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a larger distance.

A benefit of transferred DC torches is that the plasma arc is formed outside the water-cooled body, preventing heat loss—as is the case with non-transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized.&lt;ref name="Hrabovsky" /&gt; Furthermore, transferred DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is [[Cathodic#Chemistry cathode|cathodic and the other anodic]], which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred single-torch system, but allows their use with [[Insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] materials, as there is no need for it to form the other electrode.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; However, these types of setups are rare as most common non-conductive materials do not require the precise cutting ability of a plasma torch. In addition, the discharge generated by this particular plasma source configuration is characterized by a complex shape and fluid dynamics that  requires a 3D description in order to be predicted, making performance unsteady. The electrodes of non-transferred torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc.

The quality of plasma produced is a function of density (pressure), temperature and torch power (the greater the better). With regards to the efficiency of the torch itself—this can vary among manufacturers and torch technology; though for example, Leal-Quirós reports that for Westinghouse Plasma Corp. torches “a thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the efficiency represents the percentage of arc power that exits the torch and enters the process”.&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |page=1587 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Political Economy Club''' was founded by [[James Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090755/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |archivedate=2008-04-03 |df= }} James Mill, 1773-1836&lt;/ref&gt; and a circle of friends in 1821 in [[London]], for the purpose of coming to an agreement on the fundamental principles of [[political economy]].

Mary Morris. Boston, Beacon Press, 1955, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century there were no academic societies or professional associations for [[economists]].  The Political Economy Club was a way to establish a scientific community, test ideas, and provide peer review for their  work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829010046/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}   D. P. O'Brien, ''The Classical Economists Revisited.''  Princeton University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The club was founded in 1821 and supported [[free trade]]. On 18 April 1821, Swinton Holand held the first meeting at his house. A second larger meeting was held at [[Freemasons' Tavern]], London on the 30th April.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=PEC&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently members of the society are [[David Willetts]], [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Charles Dumas, [[Adam Ridley]], Diana Choyleva, [[Tim Congdon]] and Gabriel Stein.  The Club now meets on a monthly basis in [[Brooks's]] to hear papers presented by members of the club and a discussion over dinner.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Discussions ==

The participants soon found substantial difficulties in formulating and reaching agreement on their fundamental propositions.  Ricardo felt that none of their views was safe from criticism.  Reflecting on their theoretical discussions in 1823, Ricardo privately expressed his famous opinion about the "non-existence of any measure of absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo to Malthus, August 15, 1823. Quoted by Halevy, ''Ibid.,'' p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, '''psychology of religion''' consists of the application of [[List of psychological research methods|psychological methods]] and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of the religious traditions as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the natural-scientific and human-scientific approaches: the first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.

Psychologists of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The psychology of [[religion]] first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.&lt;ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732"&gt;Wulff, D. M. (2010). Psychology of Religion. In D. A. Leeming, K. Madden, &amp; S. Marian (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (pp. 732–735). New York; London: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes—the fruits, as William James put it—of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society.&lt;ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732"/&gt; These fruits may be both positive and negative.

The first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms—above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of [[Concretization|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. C. (1963). ''The Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, D. M. (1999). Psychologists Define Religion: Patterns and Prospects of a Century-Long Quest. In J. G. Platvoet and A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts, and Contests'' (pp. 207–224). Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. C., and Hood, R. W., Jr. (Eds.). (1999). ''Measures of Religiosity." Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Factor analysis was also brought into play by both [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s of religion, to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.

In the last several decades, especially among [[clinical psychologist]]s, a preference for the terms "spirituality" and "spiritual" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from "religion" and "religious." Especially in the [[United States]], "religion" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; "spirituality," in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schlehofer M. M. |author2=Omoto A. M. |author3=Adelman J. R. | year = 2008 | title = How Do "Religion" and "Spirituality" Differ? Lay Definitions Among Older Adults | URL = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 411–425 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, "spirituality" has likewise undergone an evolution in the [[Western world|West]], from a time when it was essentially a synonym for religion in its original, subjective meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Principe W | year = 1983 | title = Toward Defining Spirituality | URL = | journal = Sciences Religieuses/Studies in Religion | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 127–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Today, efforts are ongoing to "[[operationalization|operationalize]]" these terms, with little regard for their history in their Western context, and with the apparent realist assumption that underlying them are fixed qualities identifiable using empirical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. C. (2005). Measurement in the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality: Current Status and Evaluation. In [[Raymond Paloutzian|R. F. Paloutzian]] &amp; C. L. Park (Eds.), ''Handbook of the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.'' New York, London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also weaved into social communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spiritual striving and seeking the sacred: religion as meaningful goal-directed behavior.|last = Schnitker|first = Sarah|date = 2013|journal = The International Journal For The Psychology Of Religion|doi = 10.1080/10508619.2013.795822|pmid = |volume=23|pages=315–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{More footnotes|date=January 2012}}

=== William James ===
American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger and Gorsuch, 2003, The Psychology of Religion, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the ''American Psychological Association'', and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.

James distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and [[personal religion]]. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.

In studying personal religious experiences, James made a distinction between ''healthy-minded'' and ''sick-souled'' religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of [[Walt Whitman]] and the "[[mind-cure]]" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[John Bunyan]] to illustrate the sick soul.

William James' hypothesis of pragmatism stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.

=== Other early theorists ===

==== G. W. F. Hegel ====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.

==== Sigmund Freud ====
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]. Back row: [[Abraham Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]].]] 
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', he applied the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]''. When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it "is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity."

Freud views the idea of [[God]] as being a version of the [[father]] image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and [[neurosis|neurotic]]. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.

==== Carl Jung ====
The Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of [[religious symbolism]]. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' C.W.8, Aphorisms 362, 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung postulated, in addition to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the [[collective unconscious]], which is the repository of human experience and which contains "[[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of [[religious experience]] and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal [[symbol]]s, and include his work in [[comparative mythology]].

==== Alfred Adler ====
Austrian psychiatrist [[Alfred Adler]] (1870–1937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his ''Individual Psychology''. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.

Our ideas about [[God]] are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by [[natural selection]]. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.

An important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.

Compared to [[science]], another social movement, [[religion]] is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.

==== Gordon Allport ====
In his classic book ''The Individual and His Religion'' (1950), [[Gordon Allport]] (1897–1967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways.&lt;ref name="Leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_200201/ai_n9029025/?tag=untagged|title=Exploratory factor analysis of the religious maturity scale|last=Leak|first=Gary K|year=2002|work=BNET UK|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a distinction between ''Mature religion'' and
''Immature religion''. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is [[vanity|self-serving]] and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.
More recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms "intrinsic religion", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout [[faith]], and "extrinsic religion", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as [[church attendance]] to gain [[social status]]. These dimensions of religion were measured on the [[Extrinsic religious orientation|Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by [[Daniel Batson]]. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade &amp; Ventis, 1993).
More specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade &amp; Ventis, 1993).

==== Erik H. Erikson ====
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of [[identity (social science)|identity]] in personality. His biographies of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther]] reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful [[personality development]] because they are the primary way that cultures promote the [[virtues]] associated with each stage of life. Religious [[ritual]]s facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.

==== Erich Fromm ====
The American scholar [[Erich Fromm]] (1900–1980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book ''[[Psychoanalysis and Religion]]'' he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the [[Oedipus complex]] as based not so much on sexuality as on a "much more profound desire", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.&lt;ref name=PsyRel&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=Psychoanalysis and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/?id=A-3DjYEK4MIC&amp;dq=psychoanalysis+and+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010 |year=1950 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, CT, US |isbn=0-300-00089-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite book |title=Personality |last=Burger |first=Jerry |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Stamford, CT, US |isbn=0-495-09786-1 |page= |pages=122–123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvGH0J_wHggC&amp;dq=Fromm+Freud+Jung+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rudolf Otto ====
[[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] theologian and scholar of comparative religion. Otto's most famous work, ''The Idea of the [[Holy]]'' (published first in 1917 as ''Das Heilige''), defines the concept of the holy as that which is ''numinous''. Otto explained the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self." It is a [[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]] (Latin: ''mysterium tremendum'') that is both fascinating (''fascinans'') and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps [[supernatural]] [[emotion]]al reaction of [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]] drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of [[divine grace|grace]]. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.

It also sets a [[paradigm]] for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.

=== Modern thinkers ===
Autobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as [[Ralph W. Hood]] and [[Donald Eric Capps|Donald Capps]].&lt;ref name=belzen2012&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Belzen|editor1-first=Jacob A. |title=Psychology of religion: autobiographical accounts|date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4614-1601-2 |OCLC=773924284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allen Bergin ====
[[Allen Bergin]] is noted for his 1980 paper "Psychotherapy and Religious Values," which is known as a landmark in scholarly acceptance that religious values do, in practice, influence psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergin A.

====Robert Emmons====
[[Robert Emmons]] offered a theory of "spiritual strivings" in his 1999 book, ''[[The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns (book)|The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns]]''.&lt;ref name=emmons99&gt;{{cite book

==== James Hillman ====
[[James Hillman]], at the end of his book ''Re-Visioning Psychology'', reverses James' position of viewing religion through psychology, urging instead that we view psychology as a variety of religious experience. He concludes: "Psychology as religion implies imagining all psychological events as effects of Gods in the soul.&lt;ref&gt;James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology, HarperCollins, NY, 1977, p227&lt;/ref&gt;"

==== Julian Jaynes ====
[[Julian Jaynes]], primarily in his book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'', proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Jaynes | first=Julian | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=2000 | isbn=0-618-05707-2 | pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypotheses on the role of religion ==
There are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.

=== Secularization ===
The first hypothesis, [[secularization]], holds that science and technology will take the place of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Cultural divide ===
In response to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges on the premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization due to a lack of need for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The idea that [[religiosity]] arises from the human need for security has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by the idea that people are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the experimental setting, researchers have also tested compensatory control in regard to individuals' perceptions of external systems, such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a laboratory setting, individuals are more likely to endorse broad external systems (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person's personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.

== Psychometric approaches to religion ==
Since the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of [[psychometrics]] to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the [[Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Ross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first provides an age-independent measure of Allport and Ross's two religious orientations. The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.

===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===
{{Further|Sociology of religion}}
Some questionnaires, such as the [[Religious Orientation Scale]], relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.

===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===
What we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.

An objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Developmental approaches to religion ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler|Stages of faith development}}
{{further|Psychology of religious conversion}}

Many have looked at stage models, like those of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.

The best known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of [[James W. Fowler]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] at the [[Candler School of Theology]], in his ''Stages of Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-06-062866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of [[faith]] (or spiritual development) across the lifespan.

The book-length study contains a framework and ideas which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in religion{{Who|date=July 2011}}, so it appears to have [[face validity]]. James Fowler proposes six stages of faith development:

1. Intuitive-projective
2. Symbolic Literal
3. Synthetic Conventional
4. Individuating
5. Paradoxical (conjunctive)
6. Universalising.

Although there is evidence that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).

Fowler's [[Scientific method|scientific research]] has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of [[Theory of cognitive development|cognitive development]]. The tables and graphs in the book were presented in such a way that the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of [[Statistical#Statistical methods|statistical verification]] of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics{{Who|date=July 2011}} of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of [[Religious studies|academic religion]]{{Who|date=July 2011}}, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

Other theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Researchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence. One hypothesis is the correspondence hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author=Bloom, P. |date=January 2007
 | title=Religion is natural

Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. 
Researchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversation experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Evolutionary and cognitive psychology of religion ==
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Neuroscience of religion}}
&lt;!-- {{More footnotes|date=January 2012}} There's a main article linked which has more references that this section. Does that count, or should there be more references within the section itself?--&gt;
[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, [[cognition]] has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through [[natural selection]]. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.

[[Pascal Boyer]] is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book ''Religion Explained'', Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.

Religious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] will not become an evangelical [[Christian]] or a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a [[Roman Catholic]] but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says [[cognitive science]] can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.

Boyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream [[cognitive psychology]] and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's [[theory of evolution]]. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those [[reproductive]] ends.

For [[Steven Pinker]] the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that [[adaptationist]] explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.

== Religion and prayer ==
Religious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of [http://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-psychology-of-prayer-an-interview-with-kevin-ladd/ prayer]. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.

Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd and Spilka's first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).

Dein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dein Simon, Littlewood Roland | year = 2008 | title = The Psychology of Prayer and the Development of the Prayer Experience Questionnaire | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 39–52 | doi=10.1080/13674670701384396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer is also positively correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma &amp; Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Francis Leslie J., Robbins Mandy, Alan Lewis Christopher, Barnes L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offerings have been expanded by Breslan and Lewis (2008) who have constructed a five pathway model between prayer and health with the following mediators: physiological, psychological, placebo, social support, and spiritual. The spiritual mediator is a departure from the rest in that its potential for empirical investigation is not currently feasible. Although the conceptualizations of chi, the universal mind, divine intervention, and the like breach the boundaries of scientific observation, they are included in this model as possible links between prayer and health so as to not unnecessarily exclude the supernatural from the broader conversation of psychology and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Breslin Michael J., Alan Lewis Christopher | year = 2008 | title = Theoretical Models of the Nature of Prayer and Health: A Review | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 9–21 | doi=10.1080/13674670701491449}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, whether the activation of healing processes explanation is supernatural or biological, or even both, is beyond the scope of this study and this article.)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emotional distancing enables an individual to experience feelings with an amount of separation, and thus less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to catharsis through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is considerable literature on the [http://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/is-religion-special-a-critical-look-at-religion-wellbeing-and-prosociality/ relationship] between religion and health.

Psychologists consider that there are various ways in which religion may benefit both physical and mental health, including encouraging healthy lifestyles, providing social support networks and encouraging an optimistic outlook on life; prayer and meditation may also help to benefit physiological functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, religion is not a unique source of health and well-being, and there are benefits to nonreligiosity as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galen|first=Luke William|last2=Kloet|first2=James D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Mental well-being in the religious and the non-religious: evidence for a curvilinear relationship|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13674676.2010.510829|journal=Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture|volume=14|issue=7|pages=673–689|doi=10.1080/13674676.2010.510829|issn=1367-4676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal "American Psychologist" published important papers on this topic in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;see those by Miller and Thoresen (2003) and Powell, Shahabi and Thorsen (2003); see also the article by Oman and Thoresen, in [[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian]] and Park (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and personality===
{{main|Religion and personality}}
Some studies have examined whether there is a "religious personality." Research suggests that people who identify as religious are more likely to be high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low on psychoticism, but unrelated to other Big Five traits. However, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to be low on Openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Religion and prejudice===
To investigate the salience of religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some studies have shown that greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification.

Recently, [[Conversion therapy|reparative or conversion therapy]], a term used to describe a therapeutic process to change an individuals sexuality has been the subject of scrutiny and has been condemned by some governments, LGBT charities and therapy/counselling professional bodies.

== Religion and drugs ==
{{Main|Religion and drugs}}
The American psychologist [[James H. Leuba]] (1868–1946), in ''A Psychological Study of Religion'', accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.

[[William James]] was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.

== Religion and mental illness ==
{{see also|Religion and schizophrenia|Mental health of Jesus}}

Although many researches have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kind&lt;ref name="JNCN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsichiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=July 25, 2018 |issn=1545-7222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], and [[psychiatric disorders]]).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; In 2011, a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to [[religious delusion]] and [[hyperreligiosity]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

They compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

The research went further and also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum."&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that "our biases can only be suspended in the extent to which they are no longer our biases".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2017). ''[https://www.routledge.com/Psychoanalysis-Beyond-the-End-of-Metaphysics-Thinking-Towards-the-Post-Relational/Brown/p/book/9781138935181 Psychoanalysis Beyond the End of Metaphysics: Thinking Towards the Post-Relational]''. London &amp; New York: Routledge (p. 68).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pastoral psychology===
One application of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the [[pastoral care]] provided by [[pastor]]s and other [[clergy]], especially in how they support ordinary members of their [[local church|congregation]]s. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of [[chaplain]]s in [[healthcare]] and in the [[military]]. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of [[pastoral counseling]]. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as ''[[Pastoral Psychology (journal)|Pastoral Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Theology]]''. In 1984, [[Thomas C. Oden|Thomas Oden]] severely criticized mid-20th-century [[pastoral care]] and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and others.&lt;ref name=oden84&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6183">'''Sewage disposal regulation and administration''' describes the governance of sewage disposal and treatment.

==Regulation==
===United States===
[[File:Hyperion plant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Hyperion sewage treatment plant|Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Los Angeles, California is one of the largest municipal plants in the United States.]]
[[Sewage treatment]] systems in the United States are subject to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and are regulated by federal and [[U.S. state|state]] environmental agencies. In most states, local sewage plants receive discharge permits from state agencies; in the remaining states and [[Insular area#Inhabited 2|territories]], permits are issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information#tab-2 |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-06 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment plants, known as [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW) in CWA parlance, must protect the health and welfare of the local population by ensuring that wastewater does not contaminate the local potable water supply, nor violate additional [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] that protect the ecological health of the water body. 

The basic national standard for U.S. municipal treatment plants is the '''Secondary Treatment Regulation'''.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1989). "Secondary Treatment Regulation." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the U.S. must meet this [[secondary treatment]] standard. The permit authority (state agency or EPA) can compel a POTW to meet a higher standard, if there are applicable water quality standards for the receiving water body. For water bodies with stringent standards, such as [[Lake Tahoe]], POTWs must treat their discharges to [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] levels, and then pump all treated water out of the drainage basin so that no effluent ever drains to a certain body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-limits |title=NPDES Permit Limits |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-11-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such higher standards may require the POTW to construct improvements to its plant(s). If not in compliance with its permit and regulations, POTWs may be subject to heavy fines. Regulation is therefore often the driving force behind increasing sewage treatment costs in the United States, and is directly linked to the high cost of constructing or expanding a sewage treatment facility.

Many large cities in the U.S. operate [[combined sewer]]s, which collect sewage and [[stormwater]] runoff in a single pipe system leading to the treatment plant. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems due to combined sewer overflows, which are caused by large variations in flow between dry and wet weather. These overflows can lead to violation of the Secondary Treatment Regulation and/or water quality standards. Discharge permits for these POTWs typically have additional requirements that require facility improvements to reduce or eliminate the overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-csos |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-16 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
In England and Wales, [[Ofwat]] regulates charges and service standards. In [[England]] environmental standards and their achievement for sewage disposal are regulated by the [[Environment Agency]]. In [[Wales]] environmental regulation is undertaken by [[Natural Resources Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] fulfils the environmental regulation role and the [[Water Industry Commission for Scotland]] undertakes the economic regulatory role.

==Administration==
===United States===
Sewer systems are usually administered on the local level, usually citywide, and usually by the city itself. These systems, which may operate independently or as a subdivision of a city or other municipal agency, are typically operated as ''Enterprises'', meaning that they produce enough revenues to fund their own activities.

Revenues are usually generated through two charges to customers: ''connection fees'' and ''use charges''. Connection fees are charged once to new customers as they connect to the sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover [[capital investments]] made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover [[operations and maintenance]] expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.

Some POTWs are eligible for low-interest loans to finance system improvements, from the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]]. This program is administered by EPA and state agencies, using a combination of federal and state funds.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2012). [http://water.epa.gov/grants_funding/cwsrf/cwsrf_index.cfm "Clean Water State Revolving Fund."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In [[England]] sewerage and sewage disposal is undertaken by relatively few large private companies, including several multi-national companies. In [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] a "not for profit" company is the responsible body, however in Wales almost all the operational work is sub-[[subcontractor|contract]]ed by others. Charges to domestic users are based either on the metered volume of incoming water or on the notional value of the property ([[Rates (tax)|rateable]] basis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3022">'''Shakuhachi musical notation''' is a traditional tablature-style method of transcribing [[shakuhachi]] music.

A number of systems exist for notating shakuhachi music, most of which are based on the 'ro-tsu-re' (ロツレ) and the 'fu-ho-u' (フホウ) systems.

Traditional solo shakuhachi music (honkyoku) is transmitted as a semi-oral tradition; notation is often used as a mnemonic device. However, the master-disciple relationship is given emphasis within the tradition,  and written sources are considered of little value 'without experience of the living tradition of actual training within the school'.&lt;ref&gt;Ortolani, Benito. 1969. "Iemoto." Japan Quarterly 16 (3): 301.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Western [[Musical notation|staff notation]], shakuhachi playing instructions commonly indicate multiple fingerings resulting in various [[timbre]]s for a given [[pitch (music)|pitch]], and [[Microtonal music|microtonal]] slides between [[semitone]]s.

Solo Kinko school [[honkyoku]] ("original pieces") generally do not feature an explicit beat. In some notation systems, nominal rhythmic values are given; musical importance ascribed to rhythmic markings varies depending on the lineage and/or teacher.

Staff notation and graphic notation are sometimes used to notate music for shakuhachi, usually in modern music when shakuhachi is used in conjunction with Western musical instruments.

Some current publishers of traditional shakuhachi honkyoku notation include the Chikuyūsha, Chikumeisha, Chikuhoryū, and the Kokusai Shakuhachi Kenshūkan.

The '''University of Santo Tomas College of Education''', popularly known as '''"UST-Educ"''', is the teacher education, nutrition and dietetics, food technology, and library and information science school of the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest and the largest [[Catholic]] university in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It was established in 1926 at [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]].

On June 2, 2008, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs of the College were proclaimed '''Center of Excellence (COE)''' in [[Education]] by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. Likewise, the Department of Education designated it as a '''Center of Training (COT)'''

The different degree programs of the College are accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). In the academic year 2011-2012, the BSEd and BEEd programs have been granted '''Level III''' accreditation status. In 2013, the BSFT and BSND programs have been granted '''Level III ''' re-accredited status. The BLIS program has also been granted '''Candidate ''' accreditation status last academic year 2014-2015.

The College is a top performing school in the board examinations for teachers, nutritionist-dietitians and librarians.

==History of the College==
The U.S.T. College of Education was founded in June 1926 during the rectorate of Very Rev. Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. Classes at the college commenced in Intramuros, Manila. It offered the four-year Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.) degree.

In 1940, the normal school was established and offered a two-year course leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.). In 1941, the Elementary Training Department was opened as a laboratory school of the College of Education. In 1953, the degree Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E.) was offered. In June 1954, the Elementary Teachers Certificate was changed into a four-year degree called Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. From 1955-1957, a new major in Food and Nutrition was added; and later transformed into Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition (B.S.F.N.).

In the school year 1970-71, the Institute of Nutrition was established as an independent body from the College of Education under the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. Another significant event in 1971 was the merging of the Normal School with the College of Education due to the decreasing enrollment rate of the former. In July 1971, a Special Assistant to the Dean was created to take charge of the Normal elementary School since the Directress and the Secretary of the School positions were abolished.

From 1974-1976, the College offered new major studies in Chemistry and in School Guidance &amp; Character Education. The latter major replaced the co-major in Theology. The College introduced the following terminal courses to meet the demands for manpower: Certificate in Practical Arts (2 years),Certificate in Practical Dietetics (2 years) and Tourist Guide Certificate (1 year). The two former courses/programs were later on phased out while the Tourist Guide Certificate was changed into Associate in Tourism (2 years).

In the 1980s, the College of Education phased out all vocational courses/programs and the Institute of Nutrition was abolished. Later on, the College offered the following four-year degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management.

From 1990-1992, new majors for the Bachelor of Secondary Education program were offered: Computer Technology Education; Home Management and Vocational Technology (which replaced Home Economics); and Values Education (which replaced the Guidance and Character Education). The Early Childhood Education was also introduced as a new major for the Bachelor of Elementary Education program.

In the School Year 2006-07, the B.S. Tourism and B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management programs were transferred into a newly established body of the University - the Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management (I.T.H.M.). The I.T.H.M. was later renamed as College of Tourism and Hospitality Management.

In 2004, the College collaborated with Hanyang University (South Korea) for a student-exchange program.

In 2007, the College was the second top performing school in the nutrition-dietetics board exam with a passing rate of 80%, higher than the national passing rate of 56.40%. Four Thomasians entered the Top Ten Examinees of the said P.R.C. examination.

In the April 2008 Licensure Examination for Teachers (Secondary Level), the College was the second top performing school with a high 95% passing rate. Two Thomasian BSEd alumni entered the Top Ten Examinees' list.

In the school year 2008-09, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs have been granted the Center of Excellence (COE) status after undergoing the stringent evaluation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd). The COE status lasted from June 2, 2008 until June 2, 2011.

In 2008, the Department of Education (DepEd) designated the College as a Center of Training (COT) in MAPEH. Since then, DepEd and U.S.T. College of Education have been collaborating for the annual Teacher Induction Program (T.I.P.) for the public school teachers.

In April 2009, Asst. Prof. Leonila Wilhelmina N. Baltazar of the Department of Biological and General Sciences landed 8th place in the LET Secondary Level. Two other Thomasian BSEd graduates were also among the Top 10. In the November 2010 board exam for librarians, Kristi Ma Fevie Villapando Macasaet garnered the 9th Place with the score 85.10%.

In the September 2011 Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET), the College was the number one school for the Elementary Level with the highest passing rate of 97.59% (81 out of 83 Thomasians passed). On the other hand, it was the fourth top performing school in the Secondary Level with a passing rate of 88.26% (218 out of 247 examinees passed). The national passing rate for LET Elementary Level was 22.68% and 31.45% for LET Secondary Level. Asst. Prof. Erlyn M. Geronimo, a faculty member of the College and a supervising teacher of the Education High School, landed 1st Place in the exam with a percentage score of 87.80%.

In November 2011, the Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education programs of the College achieved Level III PACUCOA (Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation) accreditation.

In July 2012 board exam for nutritionists and dietitians, U.S.T. was declared as the second top-performing school with 93 out of 99 examinees who passed (93.94% passing rate). Three Thomasians made it to the Top 10 Examinees' list namely: Hannah Paulyn Yu Co (1st Place - 87.00%), Patricia Alyanna Gerona Cardoza (3rd Place - 85.05%),and Kevin Estrera Carpio (4th Place - 84.95%).

In September 2012, U.S.T. was recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission as a top performing school in the elementary and secondary education levels. In the Elementary Level, U.S.T. was the SECOND TOP PERFORMING SCHOOL with 136 out of 138 examinees who passed the exam (98.55% overall passing rate). Likewise, U.S.T. was the NUMBER ONE SCHOOL on the list of THE TOP PERFORMING SCHOOLS in the Secondary Level with 160 out of 166 new Thomasian high school teachers (96.39% overall passing rate).

In November 2012, U.S.T. was one of the 3 top performing schools in the November 2012 Librarian Board Exam with 31 out of 38 Thomasians who passed the test (81.58% passing rate).

The '''Vision Touch and Hearing Research Centre''' (VTHRC, 1988-2007) was the first Commonwealth Special Research Centre to be awarded to the [[University of Queensland]]. Located on the [[St. Lucia]] campus of the University of Queensland, [[Brisbane]], Australia, the VTHRC was headed by Prof. [[Jack Pettigrew]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], FAAS.

The core research conducted at the VTHRC involved the use of sensory systems as models for understanding brain function and neuronal plasticity. Other major research themes included neuronal death and neuroprotection, the [[evolution]] and functional adaptation of [[sensory systems]] (sensory ecology) and the brain, the neuronal basis of behaviour ([[neuroethology]]), mental health and altered states of consciousness. Throughout its first decade (1988-1998) the VTHRC's activities were centered on four  'units', each encompassing multiple lines of research: the [[Visual perception|Vision]], [[Touch]], [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] and Comparative Neuroscience units.

'''Watkins Books''' is London's oldest esoteric bookshop specializing in [[esotericism]], [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], [[oriental religion]] and [[contemporary spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westendextra.com/news/2010/apr/us-film-producer-supplies-magic-save-occult-bookshop |title=US film producer supplies the magic to save occult bookshop |publisher=West End Extra |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book store was established by John M. Watkins, a friend of [[Madame Blavatsky]], in 1897 at 26 [[Charing Cross]]. John Watkins had already been selling books via a catalogue which he began publishing in March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins Review, Issue 24, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first biography of [[Aleister Crowley]] recounts a story of Crowley making all of the books in Watkins magically disappear and reappear.&lt;ref&gt;Page 268, 1952 edition of ''The Great Beast'' by John Symonds&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Watkins (1896–1981) owned and managed the store after his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/geoffrey-watkins |title=Geoffrey Watkins: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an author&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Watkins, Geoffrey (1896-1981) | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology | publisher=The Gale Group Inc./[[Encyclopedia.com]] | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | year=2001 | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403804790.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publisher, with notable books including first publishing [[Carl Gustav Jung]]'s 1925 edition of ''[[Seven Sermons to the Dead|Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/jung.html |title=The automatic writings of Jung |publisher=[[Philipcoppens.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Watkins Books moved to 21 [[Cecil Court]] where it has been continuously trading ever since. It publishes a magazine called the ''Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine'', which has featured leading authors from [[mind-body-spirit]] and esoteric fields. Watkins Books has been owned by [[Etan Ilfeld]] since March 2010.&lt;ref name="The Bookseller"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/deal-agreed-over-watkins-books.html | title=Deal agreed over Watkins Books | work=[[The Bookseller]] | date=March 15, 2010 | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | author=Gallagher, Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kindred Spirit, Issue 109&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a new website has been launched, and the store regularly hosts book launches and signings. Additionally, the Watkins website has integrated a spiritual map of London that everyone is invited to contribute to. Watkins Books has also published a free Mind Body Spirit app that is available on the iPhone/iPad and Android devices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mind-body-spirit-books-by/id463439169?mt=8 |title=App Store - Mind Body Spirit Books by Watkins |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watkins makes an annual list of "the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People," which is published online and in the spring issue of their magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=The Spiritual 100 - Watkins' annual list of the 100 most spiritually influential living people! |publisher=Watkinsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main factors used to compile the list are that the person has to be alive, the person has to have made a unique and spiritual contribution on a global scale, and the person is frequently googled, appears in [[Nielsen Data]] and is actively talked about on the Internet.

Nevertheless, the [[electromagnetic pulse]] when the machine is discharged causes impressive lightning, referred to as a "flashover", which can be seen around many of the metallic objects in the room.]] --&gt;

The '''Z Pulsed Power Facility''', informally known as the '''Z machine''', is the largest high frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] generator in the world and is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure. Since its refurbishment in October 1996&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044428/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used primarily as an [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research facility.
Operated by [[Sandia National Laboratories]], it gathers data to aid in [[computer modeling]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s and eventual [[Nuclear power|nuclear fusion pulsed power plants]]. The Z machine is located at Sandia's main site in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

==Origins==
{{see also|Fusion power#History of research}}
The Z machine origins can be traced from the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] needing to replicate the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]] of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]] in a lab environment to better understand the physics involved.

Since the 1970s the DoE had been looking into [[List of fusion power technologies|ways]] to [[fusion power|generate electricity from fusion reactions]], with continuous reactions such as [[tokamak]]s or discrete fusion of small balls of light atoms. Since at the time lasers were far from having the required power, the main approach considered was heavy ion fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |title=FAQs |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010153/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However major advances such as [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] made [[laser]]s an option (culminating in the [[National Ignition Facility]]) and the Heavy Ion Fusion programs became more or less dormant. In 1985, the review of DoE's program by the National Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |title=1985 ICF Review by the National Academies |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010156/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "The energy crisis is dormant for the time being". Heavy ion fusion machines were tasked to help military research improve [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]].

The first research at Sandia dates back from 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |title=Particle beam fusion program publications and related reports, January 1971 to July 1979 (Book, 1979) |publisher=WorldCat.org |date=2015-05-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010434/http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gerold Yonas&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Rd2P4Mvj7vw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gerry Yonas : Resume |publisher=Bnsl.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620231327/http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated and directed the particle-beam fusion program.

In the December 1976 issue of Popular Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |title=Popular Science |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976 conference proceedings published in 1977, an article titled "Particle Beam Fusion Research"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research 1976 : Vol. 1 |publisher=Naweb.iaea.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225931/http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; described early work and first generation machines: Hydra (1972); Proto I (1975); Proto II (1977); EBFA/PBFA (electronic beam fusion accelerator/particle beam fusion accelerator) (1980).

In 1985, the PBFA-II was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |title=Saturn News Release |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094201/http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harrison, J.L. |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5700471-2njsdC/5700471.pdf |title=PBFA control and monitor system &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia continued to target heavy ion fusion at a slow pace despite the National Academies report.

The November 1978 issue of Scientific American carried Yonas' first general-public article, "Fusion power with particle beams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fusion power with particle beams |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=|bibcode=1978SciAm.239...50Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, defense-related research was also ongoing at Sandia with the Hermes III machine and Saturn (1987), upgraded from PBFA-I, which operated at lower total power than PBFA-II but advanced Sandia's knowledge in high voltage and high current and was therefore a useful predecessor to the Z machine.

In 1996, the US Army published a report&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130619090333/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/md/md1400/md1450/data/md1450data.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; on the decommissioning of the Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator. This report is useful in understanding ties between nuclear arms testing and inertial fusion energy research.

Also in 1996, the PBFA-II machine was once again upgraded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/251439-H9Gefu/webviewable/251439.pdf |title=PBFA Z: A 20-MA z-pinch driver for plasma radiation sources &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; into PBFA-Z&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"/&gt; or simply "Z machine", described for the first time to the general public on August 1998 in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs1.bib.tiera.ru/content/DVD-009/_Scientific_american_%28August_1998%29_%281998%29%28en%29%2888s%29.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121004233022/http://www.pescadoo.net/malc/art-6.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics of the Z machine==
The Z machine uses the well known principle of [[Z-pinch]] where the fast discharge of capacitors through a tube of plasma causes it to be compressed towards its centerline by the resulting [[Lorentz force]]s. [[Willard Harrison Bennett|Bennet]] successfully researched the application of Z-pinches to plasma compression. The Z machine layout is cylindrical. On the outside it houses huge [[capacitor]]s discharging through [[Marx generator]]s which generate a one microsecond high-voltage pulse. Yonas then uses a system to divide this time by a factor of 10, using the [[dielectric]] power of water, to enable the creation of 100ns discharges.

However this effort was not successful for Heavy Ion Fusion, due to lack of sufficient focusing of the beams, despite the high power used. It had been known for a long time that the Lorentz forces were radial but the current flow was highly unstable and rotated along the cylinder which causes [[Pinch (plasma physics)#Pinch production and types|twisting]] of the imploding tube therefore decreasing the quality of the compression.

A Russian scientist, [[Valentin Panteleimonovich Smirnov|Valentin Smirnov]], then had the idea of replacing the tube (called "liner") with a wire array, to fight the azimuthal flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V&lt;ref&gt;[http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/publications/workshop2009/8th_Wednesday/6B1%20Oleinik.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; facility of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design the second stage of hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux.

Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using water lines had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at [[Gramat]]). In the UK, the [[MAGPIE|Magpie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923084547/http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/experiments/Generator.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; machine was situated at the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] under control of Malcolm Haines.

By removing the polystyrene core, Sandia was able to obtain a thin 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm plasma cord in which 10 million amperes flowed with 90 megabars of pressure.

==Early operation 1996-2006==
The key attributes of Sandia's Z machine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044423/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are its 18 million amperes and a discharge time of less than 100 [[second|nanoseconds]]. The array of [[tungsten]] wires is called a "liner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |title=Sandia Z accelerator |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428231250/http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |archive-date=2015-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, Sandia tested the idea of nested wire arrays;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |title=News Release - Z machine |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607033045/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second array, out of phase with the first, compensates for [[Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities]].
In 2001, Sandia introduced the Z-Beamlet laser (from surplus equipment of the [[National Ignition Facility]]) as a tool to better image the compressing pellet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neal Singer |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |title=News Release - Z-Beamlet |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094139/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This confirmed the shaping uniformity of pellets compressed by the Z machine.

Sandia announced the fusing of small amounts of [[deuterium]] in the Z machine on April 7, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030603190249/http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2003/nuclear-power/Zneutrons.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being used as an X-ray generator, the Z machine propelled small plates at 34 kilometers a second, faster than the 30 kilometers per second that Earth travels in its orbit around the [[Sun]], and four times [[escape velocity|Earth's escape velocity]] (3 times it at sea level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Title |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040225/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also successfully created a special, hyperdense "hot ice" known as [[ice VII]], by quickly compressing water to pressures of 70,000 to 120,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (7 to 12 [[gigapascal|GPa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |title=Ice created in nanoseconds by Sandia's Z machine - March 15, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135615/http://sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |archive-date=2011-10-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical shock from impacting Z-machine accelerated projectiles is able to melt diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |title=Z machine melts diamond to puddle |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031129/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good overview of the different missions of the Z machine can be found in the 2002 Trivelpiece committee report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pulsed Power Peer Review Committee Report |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175927/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reviewed the pulsed power activities at Sandia.

During this period the power of X-ray produced jumps from 10 to 300TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/images/jpg/Z03.jpg |format=PDF |title=Pulsed Power Graph |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094156/http://www.sandia.gov/media/images/jpg/Z03.jpg |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to target the next milestone of fusion breakeven, another upgrade was then necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2004/physics-astron/Z-R.html |title=Z's $61.7 million refurbishment to advance fusion machine's capabilities |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083952/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2004/physics-astron/Z-R.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two billion Kelvin==
At the beginning of 2006, the Z machine produced plasmas with announced temperatures in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin]] (2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K) or 3.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]] (2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]), even reaching a peak at 3.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K or 6.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;°F (3.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |title=Sandia's Z machine exceeds two billion degrees Kelvin |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105101307/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |archive-date=2015-11-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_b" /&gt;
It was achieved in part by replacing the tungsten wires with thicker steel wires. This temperature, which enables a 10% to 15% efficiency in converting electrical energy to soft x-rays, was much higher than anticipated (3 to 4 times the [[kinetic energy]] of the incoming wires on axis). The [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book Of Records]] formerly listed it as the highest human-achieved temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbZMg7CGnKYC&amp;pg=PA277 |title=Guinness World Records 2008 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |title=BNL Newsroom &amp;#124; 'Perfect' Liquid Hot Enough to be Quark Soup |publisher=Bnl.gov |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820105503/http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |archive-date=2012-08-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Large Hadron Collider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gayle |first=Damien |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |title=Atom-smashing scientists reach highest ever recorded man-made temperature - 100,000 TIMES hotter then the Sun's interior &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620232835/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |archive-date=2015-06-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have since produced higher temperatures). The origin of this extra energy still remains unexplained, but it has been theorized that small-scale [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] turbulence and viscous damping would convert magnetic energy into thermal energy of the ions, which then would transfer their energy to the electrons through collisions.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

A $60 million (raised to $90 million) retrofit program called ZR (Z Refurbished) was announced in 2004 to increase its power by 50%. The Z machine was dismantled in July 2006 for this upgrade, including the installation of newly designed hardware and components and more powerful [[Marx generator]]s. The de-ionized water section of the machine has been reduced to about half the previous size while the oil section has been expanded significantly in order to house larger intermediate storage lines (i-stores) and new laser towers, which used to sit in the water section. The refurbishment was completed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |title=Successful 'shots' signal re-opening of Sandia’s giant Z accelerator - October 17, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402210006/http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The newer Z machine can now shoot around 26 million amperes&lt;ref name="sandia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|title=About Z|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142206/http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|archive-date=2016-10-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (instead of 18 million amperes previously) in 95 nanoseconds.
The radiated power has been raised to 350 terawatts and the X-ray energy output to 2.7 [[megajoule]]s. However the maximum temperature the new version may reach with the same record holder [[stainless steel]] wire-array liner used in 2005 is not yet known.

The ultra-high temperatures reached in 2006 (2.66 to 3.7 billion kelvins) are much higher than those required for the classical [[hydrogen]], deuterium and [[tritium]] fusion previously considered. They could allow, in theory if not in practice, the fusion of light hydrogen atoms with heavier atoms such as [[lithium]] or [[boron]]. These two possible fusion reactions do not produce [[neutron]]s, and thus no [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] or [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], so they open the possibility of human-made clean [[aneutronic fusion]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Sandia's roadmap includes another Z machine version called ZN (Z Neutron) to test higher yields in fusion power and automation systems. ZN is planned to give between 20 and 30 MJ of hydrogen fusion power with a shot per hour using a Russian [[Linear Transformer Driver]] (LTD) replacing the current Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Publications: Sandia Lab News: April 27, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093956/http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 8 to 10 years of operation, ZN would become a transmutation pilot plant capable of a fusion shot every 100 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/067148.pdf |format=PDF |title=Z-Inertial Dusion Energy : Power Plant Final Report FY 2006 |publisher=Prod.sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step planned would be the Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven prototype fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia Labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Architecture of petawatt-class z-pinch accelerators |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192309/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million amperes are showing a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy.

Major problems include producing energy in a single Z-pinch shot, and quickly reloading the reactor after each shot. By their early estimates, an implosion of a fuel capsule every 10 seconds could economically produce 300&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion energy.
