[[Image:Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg|thumb|right|375px|[[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]]'s Hierarchy of Disagreement lists ad hominem as the second lowest type of argument in a disagreement.]]
'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for "to the person"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem|title=Ad hominem|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aphilosopher.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/42-fallacies.pdf |title=42 Fallacies: Ad Hominem |author=Dr. Michael C.

However, its original meaning was an argument "calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, H. W. (1926), ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (under ''Technical Terms'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]],&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Doug Walton|Walton, Douglas]] |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-415-47183-4|pages=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Irving M.|last=Copi|title=Informal Logic|isbn=0-02-324940-4|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].

== Types ==
{{See also|List of fallacies}}

===''Tu quoque''===
{{Main|Tu quoque}}
''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: "You also") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a [[hypocrite]], but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.

For example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.

===Circumstantial===
{{Main|Bulverism}}
''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examples''':

# [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], "He would [say that], wouldn't he?", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.

However, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' strengthen the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of ''argumentum ad hominem'' and ''appeal to emotions''); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened. (For example, inferring guilt from a denial{{snd}}or, less starkly, excessive devaluation of a denial{{snd}}is a very common feature in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[show trials]], [[struggle sessions]], and other coercive circumstances in which the person targeted is presumed guilty.)

# Glassner suggests that Bennett is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions Bennett has taken on other issues. However wrong Bennett may or may not have been on other issues, that does not mean that his criticisms of rap were mistaken.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt by association===
{{Main|Association fallacy}}
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"/&gt;

This form of the argument is as follows:
# Source S makes claim C.
# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.
# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.

An example of this fallacy could be "My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?"

== Non-fallacious reasoning ==
When a statement is challenged by making an ''ad hominem'' attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ''an argument'' or ''a statement of fact'' (''testimony''). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"/&gt;

== Criticism as a fallacy ==

[[Doug Walton]],  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Taylor (philosopher) |last=Taylor |first=Charles |title=Philosophical Arguments |year=1995 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674664760 |pages=34–60 |url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=iqtLAsIBZ2sC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=explanation+and+practical+reason+charles+taylor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NULkg3WL_-&amp;sig=BaEwQ_OXdRBysmVeQVkM4uKJ2s8&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Explanation and Practical Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aging''' is a process by which an [[Work of art|art]]work, typically a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]], is made to appear old. It is meant to emulate the natural deterioration that can occur over many decades or centuries.

Paintings deteriorate over time because they are created using essentially incompatible materials, with each having a different reaction to the changes in the environment, including light, temperature and [[relative humidity]].

An oil painting consists of several layers, comprising the base [[canvas]], a layer of [[gesso]] base coat, several layers of the [[oil paint|oil-based paint]] and then several coats of [[varnish]] to protect the paint surface. With many different materials, it is understandable that each layer may dry at different rates and will also absorb and release moisture at different rates. When this occurs, expansion and contraction of the painting will result in a crazing of the varnish surface. This pattern of small cracks is known as [[craquelure]]. Along with the darkening or yellowing of the varnish surface, it is this visual representation of the cracking that is typically the primary indicator of ageing.

The purpose for artificially ageing is to create a finished product that accurately reflects an era or is consistent with the environment (usually period) into which it is to be placed.

In the field of [[computer security]], Anderson's rule refers to a principle formulated by [[Ross J. Anderson]]: by their nature large [[database]]s will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. If a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/aug/10/id-card-database-breach Guardian newspaper article on a security breach, in which Anderson's Rule is formulated]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Maynard''' or '''Anne, Viscountess Maynard; Anne Parsons; Nancy Parsons; Nancy Maynard; Mrs Horton''' (c. 1735 – 1814/5) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] successful courtesan and political mistress. She was de facto first lady, entertaining guests for her lover, the [[First Minister]] ([[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]).

==Life==
Her birth is estimated to be 1735 and one account says that her father was a tailor in [[Bond Street]] in London. She is thought to have first been a prostitute. She is said to have gone to Jamaica with a man called Horton or Houghton and according to some accounts they married and he may have died. When she returned she used a married name of "Mrs Horton".&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1760 she was a high-class prostitute to members of the aristocracy including the [[William Petty, second earl of Shelburne|Earl of Shelburne]], a contractor Arnold Nesbitt, and [[Richard Rigby]] who was a [[Privy Council]] member.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1764, she had a scandalous affair with [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton]] whilst his wife [[Anne FitzPatrick]] was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Kilburn, ‘Fitzpatrick , Anne, countess of Upper Ossory [other married name Anne FitzRoy, duchess of Grafton] (1737/8–1804)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/88658, accessed 23 March 2017]

&lt;/ref&gt; FitzRoy kept Parsons at his town house and took her to the opera. This brazen lack of convention offended society's standards. Parsons was openly living on the duke's estates and meanwhile the Duke became [[Secretary of State]] in 1765. 

Parsons was entertaining his guests and they reported on her informed conversation. In 1767 the Duke became [[first minister]] and she had the influence, if not the position, of a [[First Lady]] in her country. Richard Rigby used her influence to turn opinions against the Duke's wife. There was further gossip when the Duchess of Grafton become pregnant by her lover, the [[John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory|Earl of Upper Ossory]], she and the Duke were divorced by Act of Parliament on the 23 March 1769.&lt;ref name=odnbfitz&gt;Peter Durrant, ‘FitzRoy, Augustus Henry, third duke of Grafton (1735–1811)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9628, accessed 14 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons may have become the First Minister's wife had he not discovered that Parsons was having an affair with [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;A. A. Hanham, ‘Parsons, Anne [Nancy] married name Anne Maynard, Viscountess Maynard] (c.1735–1814/15)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75617, accessed 14 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Mrs. Horton, Later Viscountess Maynard by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|left|''Mrs. Horton, Later Viscountess Maynard'' by [[Joshua Reynolds]] ]]

Three months later, on 24 June 1769, the Duke married Elizabeth Wrottesley (1 November 1745{{snd}}25 May 1822), daughter of the [[Sir Richard Wrottesley, 7th Baronet|Reverend Sir Richard Wrottesley]], [[Dean of Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hellicar|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In around 1770 she was painted by [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Again in 1771 she was painted by [[George Willison (artist)|George Willison]] in "Turkish Dress". That painting is now in [[Yale Centre for British Art]].&lt;ref name=baetjer&gt;{{cite book|author1=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|author2=Katharine Baetjer|title=British Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1575-1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZzL3ey6gDYC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2009|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-348-7|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and Sackville spent the next six/seven years together until 1706 when Parsons attracted the attention of [[Viscount Maynard|Charles Maynard, second Viscount Maynard]]. At this point Maynard was 23 and Parsons was maybe ten years older.&lt;ref name=baetjer/&gt; The two married on 24 September 1776 in London before visiting Italy where they had difficulty entering the Royal court because of their history.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; 

In 1784 the two created a [[menage a trois]] with the teenage [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]]. This liaison was with Russell grandmother's approval and it continued until 1787. Parsons was received by minor members of the Royal Family and spent the remainder of her life solo in Italy and France.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She died near Paris in 1814 or 1815.&lt;ref name=baetjer/&gt;

'''BioCity Nottingham''' is a bioscience [[science park]] in central [[Nottingham]] in the United Kingdom. It is the UK's largest bioscience innovation and incubation centre.

==History==
In 2002, laboratories and office space were donated to [[Nottingham Trent University]] by BASF. Biocity was founded in September 2003 by the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] (which was based close to BioCity).

Biocity's premises were developed from the building donated by BASF. Phase 1 was completed in March 2004, providing {{convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space, then Phase 2 in March 2006 provided {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. When Phase 3 of the development was completed in October 2008, with {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, funding from emda also finished.

===Background===
Nottingham has long been an important centre for bioscience research, principally through work done at the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and by [[Boots UK|Boots]], Britain's largest retail [[pharmacy]] company, which is based in [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]]/[[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]]. Although Boots no longer engages in drug discovery, [[Ibuprofen]] (iso-butyl-propanoic-phenolic acid) was created by Boots scientists in Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf Boots ibuprofen project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001172448/http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf |date=1 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 Nottingham was named as a Science City; the other 5 Science Cities were [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamsciencecity.co.uk/about-us/ About Us at Birmingham Science City]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], [[York]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm Newcastle Science City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002747/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manchester]].

==Structure==
It is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/318420 situated] in former [[BASF]] buildings, which previously were used by Boots as research laboratories.

The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/948642 site] on ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1899769 Pennyfoot Street]'', between the [[A60 road|A60]] and [[A612 road|A612]], is for bioscience [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s. The University of Nottingham has the largest collaboration with companies at BioCity, with a few having links with NTU.

There are three buildings –
* Innovation Centre Building
* Stewart Adams Building – named after Dr Stewart Adams OBE, who led the team at Boots (with John Nicholson) that discovered Ibuprofen, a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3351540/Dr-Stewart-Adams-I-tested-ibuprofen-on-my-hangover.html Dr Stewart Adams]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Laurus Building

In January 2012 BioCity opened a second site, BioCity Scotland, resulting from the acquisition of a former MSD research facility near Glasgow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45704">The '''biochemistry of [[Alzheimer's disease]]''' (AD), one of the most common causes of adult [[dementia]], is not yet very well understood. AD has been identified as a possible [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease due to the accumulation of abnormally folded [[amyloid beta]] protein in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E |title=Role of protein aggregation in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases |journal=Neuromolecular Med. |volume=4 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–36 |year=2003 |pmid=14528050 |doi=10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amyloid beta, also written Aβ, is a short [[peptide]] that is an abnormal [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] byproduct of the [[transmembrane protein]] [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kerr ML, Small DH |title=Cytoplasmic domain of the beta-amyloid protein precursor of Alzheimer's disease: function, regulation of proteolysis, and implications for drug development |journal=J.

Amyloid beta [[monomer]]s are soluble and contain short regions of [[beta sheet]] and [[polyproline helix|polyproline II helix]] [[secondary structure]]s in solution,&lt;ref name="Danielsson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danielsson J, Andersson A, Jarvet J, Gräslund A |title=15N relaxation study of the amyloid beta-peptide: structural propensities and persistence length |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry : MRC |volume=44 Spec No |issue= |pages=S114–21 |year=2006 |pmid=16826550 |doi=10.1002/mrc.1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are largely [[alpha helix|alpha helical]] in membranes;&lt;ref name="Tomaselli"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomaselli S, Esposito V, Vangone P |title=The alpha-to-beta conformational transition of Alzheimer's Abeta-(1-42) peptide in aqueous media is reversible: a step by step conformational analysis suggests the location of beta conformation seeding |journal=Chembiochem |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=257–67 |year=2006 |pmid=16444756 |doi=10.1002/cbic.200500223|display-authors=etal|hdl=1874/20092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, at sufficiently high concentration, they undergo a dramatic [[conformational change]] to form a [[beta sheet]]-rich [[tertiary structure]] that aggregates to form [[amyloid|amyloid fibril]]s.&lt;ref name="Ohnishi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohnishi S, Takano K |title=Amyloid fibrils from the viewpoint of protein folding |journal=Cell.

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]], a [[microtubule-associated protein]] expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize [[microtubules]] in the cell [[cytoskeleton]]. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by [[phosphorylation]]; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments&lt;ref name="Goedert"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goedert M, Klug A, Crowther RA |title=Tau protein, the paired helical filament and Alzheimer's disease |journal=J. Alzheimers Dis. |volume=9 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=195–207 |year=2006 |pmid=16914859 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as [[neurofibrillary tangles]] and as dystrophic [[neurite]]s associated with amyloid plaques. Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, it has recently been shown that a depletion of a [[prolyl isomerase]] protein in the [[parvulin]] family accelerates the accumulation of abnormal tau.&lt;ref name="Pastorino"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pastorino L, Sun A, Lu PJ |title=The prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-beta production |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7083 |pages=528–34 |year=2006 |pmid=16554819 |doi=10.1038/nature04543|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..528P |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim J, Lu KP |title=Pinning down phosphorylated tau and tauopathies |journal=Biochim.

Neuroinflammation is also involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms. Considerable pathological and clinical evidence documents immunological changes associated with AD, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;ref name="Akiyama"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiyama H, Barger S, Barnum S, Bradt B, Bauer J, Cole GM |title=Inflammation and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Neurobiol Aging |volume=21 |pages=383–421 |year=2000 |pmid=10858586 |doi=10.1016/S0197-4580(00)00124-X |issue=3|display-authors=etal|pmc=3887148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swardfager"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swardfager W, Lanctôt K, Rothenburg L, Wong A, Cappell J, Herrmann N |title=A meta-analysis of cytokines in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=10 |pages=930–941 |year=2010 |pmid=20692646 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these changes may be a cause or consequence of AD remains to be fully understood, but inflammation within the brain, including increased reactivity of the resident [[microglia]] towards amyloid deposits, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Neuropathology==

At a [[macroscopic]] level, AD is characterized by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].&lt;ref name="pmid12934968"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[amyloid plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are clearly visible by [[microscopy]] in AD brains.&lt;ref name="Tiraboschi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tiraboschi P, Hansen L, Thal L, Corey-Bloom J | title = The importance of neuritic plaques and tangles to the development and evolution of AD | journal = Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 11 | pages = 1984–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15184601 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000129697.01779.0A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques are dense, mostly [[insoluble]] deposits of [[protein]] and [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] material outside and around neurons. Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell. Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations.&lt;ref name="pmid8038565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouras C, Hof PR, Giannakopoulos P, Michel JP, Morrison JH |title=Regional distribution of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the cerebral cortex of elderly patients: a quantitative evaluation of a one-year autopsy population from a geriatric hospital |journal=Cereb.

==Biochemical characteristics==
Fundamental to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease is the biochemical events that leads to accumulation of the amyloid-beta and tau-protein. A delicate balance of the enzymes secretases regulate the amyloid-beta accumulation. The alpha-secretase activity discourages its accumulation. Recently, a link between cholinergic neuronal activity and the activity of alpha-secretase has been highlighted,&lt;ref&gt;Baig AM. Connecting the Dots: Linking the Biochemical to Morphological Transitions in Alzheimer's Disease. ACS Chem Neurosci. 2018 Aug 30. doi: 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00409. [Epub ahead of print] PubMed {{PMID|30160095}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which can discourage Amyloid-beta proteins deposition in brain of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.  
Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease, or [[proteopathy]], due to the accumulation of abnormally folded Amyloid-beta proteins in the brains of AD patients.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto"/&gt; Abnormal amyloid-beta accumulation can first be detected using cerebrospinal fluid analysis and later using positron emission tomography (PET).&lt;ref name="Palmqvist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmqvist|first1=Sebastian|title=Cerebrospinal fluid analysis detects cerebral amyloid-β accumulation earlier than positron emission tomography, 2016 Apr; 139(4)|journal=Brain|doi=10.1093/brain/aww015|pmid=26936941|volume=139|issue=Pt 4|pmc=4806222|year=2016|pages=1226–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although AD shares pathophysiological mechanisms with prion diseases, it is not transmissible like prion diseases.&lt;ref name="Castellani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castellni RJ, Perry G, Smith MA | title = Prion disease and Alzheimer's disease: pathogenic overlap | journal = Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars)| year = 2004 | pmid = 15190676 | volume=64 | issue = 1 | pages=11–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amyloid-beta, also written Aβ, is a short [[peptide]] that is a [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] byproduct of the [[transmembrane protein]] [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development. The [[presenilin]]s are components of a proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation.&lt;ref name="Cai"/&gt;
Although amyloid beta [[monomer]]s are harmless, they undergo a dramatic [[conformational change]] at sufficiently high concentration to form a [[beta sheet]]-rich [[tertiary structure]] that aggregates to form [[amyloid|amyloid fibrils]]&lt;ref name="Ohnishi"/&gt; that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as ''senile plaques'' or ''neuritic plaques'', in less dense aggregates as ''diffuse plaques'', and sometimes in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain in a process called amyloid angiopathy or [[congophilic angiopathy]].

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]], a [[microtubule-associated protein]] expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize [[microtubules]] in the cell [[cytoskeleton]]. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by [[phosphorylation]]; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments&lt;ref name="Goedert"/&gt; that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as ''neurofibrillary tangles'' and as dystrophic [[neurite]]s associated with amyloid plaques.

Levels of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) are reduced. Levels  of other neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[somatostatin]] are also often reduced. Replenishing the ACh by anti-cholinerstrases is an approved mode of treatment by FDA. An alternative method of stimulating ACh receptors of M1-M3 types by synthetic agonists that have a slower rate of dissociation from the receptor has been proposed as next generation cholinomimetic in Alzheimer's disease&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Disease mechanism==
Although the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in [[cholinergic]] signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===Cholinergic hypothesis===

The oldest hypothesis is the "cholinergic hypothesis". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of [[acetylcholine]], a vital [[neurotransmitter]]. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the "cholinergic nuclei". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]s (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical. More recently, cholinergic effects have been proposed as a potential causative agent for the formation of plaques and tangles&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shen ZX |title=Brain cholinesterases: II. The molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=308–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15236795 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to generalized neuroinflammation.&lt;ref name="Wenk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as "ba-ptist" and "tau-ist" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that "Tau-ists" believe that the [[tau protein]] abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while "ba-ptists" believe that [[beta amyloid]] deposits are the causative factor in the disease.&lt;ref name="Mudher"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mudher A, Lovestone S |title=Alzheimer's disease-do tauists and baptists finally shake hands? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11801334 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02031-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tau hypothesis===

The hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss.&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmitz C, Rutten BP, Pielen A |title=Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am. J. Pathol. |volume=164 |issue=4 |pages=1495–502 |date=1 April 2004|pmid=15039236 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000294401063235X |pmc=1615337 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63235-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mechanism for neurotoxicity has been proposed based on the loss of microtubule-stabilizing tau protein that leads to the degradation of the cytoskeleton.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray EG, Paula-Barbosa M, Roher A |title=Alzheimer's disease: paired helical filaments and cytomembranes |journal=Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=91–110 |year=1987 |pmid=3614544 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.1987.tb00174.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, consensus has not been reached on whether tau hyperphosphorylation precedes or is caused by the formation of the abnormal helical filament aggregates.&lt;ref name="Mudher" /&gt; Support for the tau hypothesis also derives from the existence of other diseases known as [[tauopathy|tauopathies]] in which the same protein is identifiably misfolded.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams DR |title=Tauopathies: classification and clinical update on neurodegenerative diseases associated with microtubule-associated protein tau |journal=Internal Medicine Journal |volume=36 |issue=10 |pages=652–60 |year=2006 |pmid=16958643 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2006.01153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a majority of researchers support the alternative hypothesis that amyloid is the primary causative agent.&lt;ref name="Mudher" /&gt;

===Amyloid hypothesis===

The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on [[chromosome 21]], and patients with [[trisomy 21]] - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra [[gene dosage|gene copy]] almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age.&lt;ref name="Nistor"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nistor M, Don M, Parekh M |title=Alpha- and beta-secretase activity as a function of age and beta-amyloid in Down syndrome and normal brain |journal=Neurobiol.

The concentrations of dolichyl phosphate are also increased, while [[cholesterol]] remains unchanged.

==Glucose consumption==
The human brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body and metabolizes a large amount of glucose to produce cellular energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).&lt;ref name=Reference2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cunnane S, Nugent S, Roy M | year = 2011 | title = Brain fuel metabolism, aging, and Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 3–20 | doi=10.1016/j.nut.2010.07.021|display-authors=etal | pmid=21035308 | pmc=3478067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its high energy demands, the brain is relatively inflexible in its ability to utilize substrates for energy production and relies almost entirely on circulating glucose for its energy needs.&lt;ref name=Reference7&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costantini LC, Barr LJ, Vogel JL, Henderson ST | year = 2008 | title = Hypometabolism as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = BMC Neurosci | volume = 9 | issue = Suppl 2| page = S16 | doi=10.1186/1471-2202-9-s2-s16| pmid = 19090989 | pmc = 2604900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This dependence on glucose puts the brain at risk if the supply of glucose is interrupted, or if its ability to metabolize glucose becomes defective.

Imaging studies have shown decreased utilization of glucose in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients early in the disease, before clinical signs of cognitive impairment occur. This decrease in [[glucose metabolism]] worsens as clinical symptoms develop and the disease progresses.&lt;ref name=Reference8&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoyer S | year = 1992 | title = Oxidative energy metabolism in Alzheimer brain.

Abnormally low rates of cerebral glucose metabolism are found in a characteristic pattern in the Alzheimer’s disease brain, particularly in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. These brain regions are believed to control multiple aspects of [[memory]] and [[cognition]]. This metabolic pattern is reproducible and has even been proposed as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) correlates with plaque density and cognitive deficits in patients with more advanced disease.&lt;ref name="Reference10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reference11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meier-Ruge W, Bertoni-Freddari C, Iwangoff P | year = 1994 | title = Changes in brain glucose metabolism as a key to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Gerontology | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 246–252 | doi=10.1159/000213592 | pmid=7959080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) may not be solely an artifact of brain cell loss since it occurs in asymptomatic patients at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, such as patients homozygous for the epsilon 4 variant of the [[apolipoprotein E]] gene (APOE4, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease), as well as in inherited forms of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name=Reference4&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiman EM, Chen K, Alexander GE | year = 2004 | title = Functional brain abnormalities in young adults at genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's dementia | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2635903100 | pmid = 14688411 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 284–289 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2003PNAS..101..284R |pmc = 314177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that DCGM occurs before other clinical and pathological changes occur, it is unlikely to be due to the gross cell loss observed in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name="Reference7"/&gt;

In imaging studies involving young adult APOE4 carriers, where there were no signs of cognitive impairment, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) was detected in the same areas of the brain as older subjects with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name=Reference4 /&gt; However, DCGM is not exclusive to APOE4 carriers.

These genes are also highly enriched in cell adhesion Gene Ontology (GO) terms and often map to chromosomal fragile sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=D.I.|date=2005-10-14|title=Common fragile sites, extremely large genes, neural development and cancer|url=http://www.cancerletters.info/article/S0304-3835(05)00823-2/fulltext|journal=Cancer Letters|language=en|volume=232|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2005.06.049|pmid=16221525|issn=0304-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of known Alzheimer's disease risk gene products including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and gamma-secretase, as well as the APOE receptors and GWAS risk loci take part in similar cell adhesion mechanisms. It was concluded that dysfunction of cell and synaptic adhesion is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and mutational instability of large synaptic adhesion genes may be the etiological trigger of neurotransmission disruption and synaptic loss in brain aging. As a typical example, this hypothesis explains the APOE risk locus of AD in context of signaling of its giant lipoprotein receptor, LRP1b which is a large tumor-suppressor gene with brain-specific expression and also maps to an unstable chromosomal fragile site. The large gene instability hypothesis puts the DNA damage mechanism at the center of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

The '''biological basis of personality''' is the collection of [[brain]] systems and mechanisms that underlie [[Personality|human personality]]. [[Neuroscience|Human neurobiology]], especially as it relates to [[complex traits]] and behaviors, is not well understood, but research into the [[Neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] and functional underpinnings of personality are an active field of research. [[Model organism|Animal models of behavior]], molecular biology, and [[Neuroimaging|brain imaging]] techniques have provided some insight into human personality, especially [[Trait theory|trait theories]].

Much of the current understanding of personality from a neurobiological perspective places an emphasis on the biochemistry of the behavioral systems of reward, motivation, and punishment. This has led to a few biologically based personality theories such as [[Hans Eysenck#Model of personality|Eysenck's three factor model of personality]], Grey's [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] (RST), and [[Cloninger#Temperament and Character Inventory|Cloninger's model of personality]]. The [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model of personality]] is not biologically based; yet some research in the differences in brain structures provided biological support also for this model.

==Defining personality in a biological context==
[[Personality]] can be defined as a set of characteristics or traits that drive individual differences in human behavior. From a biological perspective, these traits can be traced back to brain structures and neural mechanisms. However, this definition and theory of biological basis is not universally accepted. There are many conflicting theories of personality in the fields of [[psychology]], psychiatry, philosophy, and [[neuroscience]]. A few examples of this are the [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]] debate and how the idea of a 'soul' fits into biological theories of personality.&lt;ref name="LeDoux"&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=J.|year=2003|title=The Self|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1001|issue=1|pages=295–304| pmid=14625368|doi=10.1196/annals.1279.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of biology-based personality research==
[[File:Hans.Eysenck.jpg|thumbnail|Hans Eysenck]]
Since the time of the ancient Greeks, humankind has attempted to explain personality through spiritual beliefs, philosophy, and psychology. Historically, studies of personality have traditionally come from the social sciences and humanities, but in the past two decades neuroscience has begun to be more influential in the understanding of human personality.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R. J. | year = 2001 | title = Toward a biology of personality and emotion | url = http://www.cogsci.bme.hu/DoCS/oktatas/kurzusok/olvasoszeminarium/2003/towardabiology.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 935 | issue = | pages = 191–207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03481.x }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most cited and influential figures in publishing the first biology-based personality theories are [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Jeffrey Alan Gray]]. Eysenck used both behavioral and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] methodologies to test and develop his theories.&lt;ref name="CorrPerkins2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corr|first1=Philip J.|last2=Perkins|first2=Adam M.|title=The role of theory in the psychophysiology of personality: From Ivan Pavlov to Jeffrey Gray|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|volume=62|issue=3|year=2006|pages=367–376|issn=0167-8760|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He published a book in 1947 called ''Dimensions of Personality'', describing the personality dimensions of Extraversion and Neuroticism. Gray, a student of Eysenck, studied personality traits as individual differences in sensitivity to rewarding and punishing stimuli.&lt;ref name=CorrPerkins2006 /&gt; The significance of Gray's work and theories was his use of biology to define behavior, which stimulated a lot of subsequent research.&lt;ref name="Fowles"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fowles |first=Don |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 2: Jeffrey Gray's Contributions to Theories of Anxiety, Personality, and Psychopathology|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Donald Prell]] published an experiment in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of biology-based personality research is relatively new, but growing in interest and number of publications.&lt;ref name="Canli5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Canli |first=Turhan |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 5: Genomic Imaging of Extraversion|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, there was a conference specifically on the topic, called ''The Biological Basis of Personality and Individual Differences''.&lt;ref name="Canli"&gt;{{cite book |last=Canli |first=Turhan |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for presenting and sharing of ideas between psychologists, psychiatrists, molecular geneticists, and neuroscientists, and eventually gave birth to the book under the same title.&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; The book is a collection of current research (as of 2006) in the field contributed by many authors and edited by Turhan Canli. Recently, psychology professor Colin G. DeYoung has even named the idea as the field of 'Personality Neuroscience'.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Experimental techniques==
There are many experimental techniques for measuring the biology of the brain, but there are five main methods used to investigate the biological basis of personality.&lt;ref name="DeYoung2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeYoung|first1=Colin G.|title=Personality Neuroscience and the Biology of Traits|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=4|issue=12|year=2010|pages=1165–1180|issn=1751-9004|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00327.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological data from these methods are commonly correlated with personality traits. These personality traits are often determined by personality questionnaires. However, personality questionnaires may be biased because they are self-reported. As a result, scientists emphasize using several different measures of personality,&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuckerman |first=Marvin |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 3: Biosocial Bases of Sensation Seeking|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely self-reported measures of personality. For example, another measure of personality traits is observation of behavior. Both humans and animals have been observed to measure personality traits, but animals are particularly useful for studying the long-term behavioral-biological relationship of personality.&lt;ref name="Mehta and Gosling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mehta |first=Pranjal |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 20: How Can Animal Studies Contribute to Research on the Biological Bases of Personality|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting method that has become more sophisticated and affordable to researchers is the method of whole genome expression analysis. This method involves collecting data for a large number of genes simultaneously which provides many advantages in studying personality. In an article written by Alison M. Bell and Nadia Aubin-Horth, they describe the advantages very clearly by stating, "For one, it is probable that the genetic basis of personality is polygenic, so it makes sense to simultaneously study many genes. In addition, gene products rarely act alone. Instead, they perform their function by interacting together in pathways and networks. As a result, the molecular changes that characterize a phenotype are frequently not based on a single marker or gene, but rather on an entire pathway. Whole genome expression profiling therefore has the potential to reveal new candidates genes and pathways."&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A.M., &amp; Aubin-Horth, N. (2010).

==Genetic and molecular correlations to personality==
===Neurotransmitters ===
[[File:Pubmed equitativa hormonal.png|thumb|Dopamine and Serotonin pathways]]
The biology-based personality theories (discussed below) are based on correlating personality traits with behavioral systems related to motivation, reward, and punishment. On a broad level, this involves the autonomic nervous system, fear-processing circuits in the [[amygdala]], the reward pathway from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and prefrontal cortex. All of these circuits heavily rely on neurotransmitters and their precursors, but there has been the most research support for dopamine and serotonin pathways:

*[[Dopamine]]: Dopamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] that has been found to promote exploratory behavior.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein" /&gt; Dopaminergic pathways have been specifically correlated with the extraversion trait of the Five Factor Model of Personality.&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt; The [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) enzyme has a preferential affinity for dopamine, and its levels are inversely correlated with sensation seeking.&lt;ref name=Zuckerman /&gt;
*[[Serotonin]]: Serotonin is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]], and has been found to promote avoidance behavior through inhibitory pathways.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebstein | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Auerbach | first2 = Judith G. | year = 2002 | title = Dopamine D4 receptor and serotonin transporter promoter polymorphisms and temperament in early childhood | url = | journal = Molecular Genetics and the Human Personality | volume = | issue = | pages = 137–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, serotonin has been associated with Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness (traits defined by the Five Factor Model of Personality).&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt;

===Genes===
Previous studies show that genes account for at most 50 percent of a given trait.&lt;ref name=LeDoux /&gt; However, it is widely accepted that variance in gene sequence affect behavior, and genes are a significant risk factor for [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Whittle&gt;Whittle, S., Allen, N. B., Lubman, D. I., &amp; Yucel, M. (2006). Neurobiological basis of temperament: Towards a better understanding of psychopathology. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 30(4), 511-525.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing interest in using molecular genetics in tracing the biological basis of personality,&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; there may be more gene-trait links found in the future.

Varying [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s and sequence repeats in the gene for [[dopamine receptor D4]] and serotonin transporter gene [[5-HTTLPR]], have both been found to influence the extraversion trait in adults. Specifically, study participants with at least one copy of the 7-repeat variant of the dopamine receptor D4 gene had higher scores of self-reported extraversion.&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; This suggests that dopamine and serotonin interact to regulate the conflicting behavioral traits of careless exploration vs. cautious inhibition.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein"/&gt;

=== Synaptic plasticity ===
[[Synaptic plasticity]] refers to the ability of neurons to strengthen or weaken the connections between them. According to [[Hebbian theory]], these connections are strengthened and maintained through repeated stimulation between neurons. Specifically, there is an emphasis on [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP), which is the prolonged strengthening of synaptic connections that facilitate learning from experience.

On a larger scale, there are many pathways and brain regions that are interdependent and contribute to a cohesive, stable personality. For example, the amygdala and [[hippocampus]] of the [[limbic system]] mediate emotional intensity and consolidate memory of these experiences. But the basic mechanism by which these pathways and brain regions perform these functions, is synaptic plasticity. Ultimately, it boils down to this feature of neurons that allows the brain to learn from repeated experiences, retain memories, and ultimately maintain personality.&lt;ref name = LeDoux2&gt;LeDoux, J. E. (2003). Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph E. LeDoux|Joseph LeDoux]], an award-winning neuroscientist, asserts that although humans share the same brain systems, it is the unique wiring of neurons that is different in each person and makes their personality.&lt;ref name = LeDoux2/&gt;

==Personality theories with biological basis==
There are many theories of personality that on the identification of a set of traits that encompass human personality. Few however, are biologically based. This section will describe some theories of personality that have a biological basis. Additionally, it will present biological support for a popular non-biologically based personality theory, the Five Factor Model.

===Eysenck's three-factor model of personality===
Eysenck's three-factor model of personality was a causal theory of personality based on activation of [[reticular formation]] and [[limbic system]]. The reticular formation is a region in the [[brainstem]] that is involved in mediating arousal and consciousness. The limbic system is involved in mediating emotion, behavior, motivation, and long-term memory. 
# [[Extraversion]] (E) – degree to which people are outgoing and are interactive with people, which is mediated by the activation of the reticular formation.
# [[Neuroticism]] (N) – degree of emotional instability, which is associated with the limbic system.
# [[Psychoticism]] (P) – degree of aggression and interpersonal hostility.

===Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory===
Gray's [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] (RST) is based on the idea that there are three brain systems that all differently respond to rewarding and punishing stimuli.&lt;ref name=CorrPerkins2006 /&gt; 
# [[Fight-or-flight response|Fight-flight-freeze system]] (FFFS) – mediates the emotion of fear (not anxiety) and active avoidance of dangerous situations. The personality traits associated with this system is fear-proneness and avoidance.
# [[Behavioral inhibition system]] (BIS) – mediates the emotion of anxiety and cautious risk-assessment behavior when entering dangerous situations due to conflicting goals. The personality traits associated with this system is worry-proneness and anxiety.
# [[Behavioral approach system]] (BAS) – mediates the emotion of 'anticipatory pleasure,' resulting from reactions to desirable stimuli. The personality traits associated with this system are optimism, reward-orientation, and impulsivity.

[[Image:Cloninger Model.jpg|thumb|200px| Cloninger's biological dimensions of personality]]

===Cloninger model of personality===
{{anchor|Cloninger Model of Personality}}
This model of personality is based on the idea that different responses to punishing, rewarding, and novel stimuli the main characteristics of the human mind is caused by an interaction of the three dimensions below:
# [[Novelty Seeking]] (NS) – degree to which people are impulsive, correlated with low [[dopamine]] activity.
# [[Harm Avoidance]] (HA) – degree to which people are anxious, correlated with high [[serotonin]] activity.
# [[Reward Dependence]] (RD) – degree to which people are approval seeking, correlated with low [[norepinephrine]] activity.

In one MRI study,&lt;ref name="GardiniCloninger2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardini|first1=Simona|last2=Cloninger|first2=C. Robert|last3=Venneri|first3=Annalena|title=Individual differences in personality traits reflect structural variance in specific brain regions|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=79|issue=5|year=2009|pages=265–270|issn=0361-9230|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.03.005|pmid=19480986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelty Seeking correlated with increased [[grey matter]] volume in regions of the [[cingulate cortex]], Harm Avoidance correlated with decreased grey matter volume in the orbitofrontal, occipital, and parietal cortex. Reward Dependence correlated with decreased grey matter volume in the [[caudate nucleus]].

===Five factor model of personality===
The [[five factor model]] is a widely used personality assessment that describes five core traits that a person possesses:
# [[Openness]] – degree to which people enjoy experiencing new stimuli

'''Biopower''' (or ''biopouvoir'' in French) is a term coined by French [[scholar]], [[historian]], and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]]. It relates to the practice of modern [[nation states]] and their regulation of their subjects through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the [[control of populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the [[Collège de France]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977&amp;ndash;1978'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4; see notes on p.&amp;nbsp;24, notes&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Society Must Be Defended'' Lectures at the Collège de France 1975&amp;ndash;1976 p.&amp;nbsp;243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the term first appeared in print in ''The Will To Knowledge'', Foucault's first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, (1998) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal [[physical health]]. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, [[biopolitics]], which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/biopolitics-an-overview/|title=Biopolitics: An Overview|date=2013-01-21|work=The Anthropology of Biopolitics|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foucault's conception ==

For Foucault, biopower is a [[technology]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] for managing [[humans]] in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' and ''biopolitics of the population'' through societal ''[[Disciplinary institutions]]''. Initially imposed from outside whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes [[encoded]] into social practices as well as human behavior as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible—the emergence of the modern [[nation state]], [[capitalism]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v013/13.1.policante.html|title=Amedeo Policante. "War against Biopower: Timely Reflections on an Historicist Foucault", ''Theory &amp; Event'', 13. 1 March 2010|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled ''Security, Territory, Population'' delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

{{cquote|By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how, starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species. This is what I have called biopower.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, "an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature Vol 490'' p. 309, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It produces a generalized disciplinary society&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 377-378, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''regulatory controls'' through ''biopolitics of the population''".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.,&amp;nbsp;378 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population’’, see also note 71, p. 397 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Sexuality Vol 1'' p.&amp;nbsp;139 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture ''Society Must Be Defended'', Foucault examines ''biopolitical state racism'', and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopolitics&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;91 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and discipline:

{{cquote|Where discipline is the technology deployed to make individuals behave, to be efficient and productive workers, biopolitics is deployed to manage population; for example, to ensure a healthy workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.&amp;nbsp;239&amp;ndash;64 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that the previous [[Greco-Roman]], [[Medieval]] rule of the [[Roman emperor]], the [[Divine right of kings]], [[Absolute monarchy]] and the [[popes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;401 2007&lt;/ref&gt; model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor [[body politic]] which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called [[Estates of the realm]] and the Medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]] next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of [[high treason]] and if found guilty the sentence of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]] was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2)'' 1351 "When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell ''Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of [[political power]]. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; [[liberal democracy]] and [[Political parties]]; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe in 1929(most certainly as late as 1971 in Switzerland see [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland]]), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous [[Jim Crow laws]] in 1964 (see [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of ''[[Disciplinary institutions|Disciplinary institution]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;16 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of ''anatomo-politics of the human body,'' a biopolitics and bio-history of man.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio-history and Biopolitics ''Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‐130, October 2014'' Originally published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to [[Arthur Jensen]] overt racism and Foucault's great friend [[Jacques Ruffié]] response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie à la culture [From biology to culture]&lt;/ref&gt; A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a "scientific" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;163&amp;ndash;90 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was [[stochastic]] and "massifying" rather than "individualizing". By "massifying" Foucault means transforming into a population ("population state"),&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.55-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the [[state (polity)|State]] "governs less" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this ''anatomo-biopoltics'' of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the [[Mathematical sciences]] and the [[Biological sciences]]–coupled together with the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the 19th century was precisely that, I wouldn't say exactly that sovereignty's old right-to take life or let live-was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which penetrate it, permeate. To say that power took possession of life in the nineteenth century, or to say that power at least takes life under its care in the nineteenth century, is to say that it has, thanks to the play of technologies of discipline on the one hand and technologies of regulation on the other, succeeded in covering the whole surface that lies between the organic and the biological, between body and population. We are, then, in a power that has taken control of both the body and life or that has, if you like, taken control of life in general – with the body as one pole and the population as the other. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as a political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem I would like in fact like to trace the transformation not at the level of political theory, but rather at the level of the mechanisms, techniques, and technologies of power. We saw the emergence of techniques of power that were essentially centered on the body, on the individual body. They included all devices that were used to ensure the spatial distribution of individuals bodies (their separation, their alignment, their serialization, and their surveillance)and the organization, around those individuals, of a whole field of visibility. They were also techniques that could be used to take control over bodies. Attempts were made to increase their productive force through exercise, drill, and so on. They were also techniques for rationalizing and strictly economizing on a power that had to be used in the least costly way possible, thanks to whole system of surveillance, hierarchies, inspections, book-keeping, and reports-all the technology of labor. It was established at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the course of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.241-244 and p.252 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]] Challenges pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with [[Samuel P. Huntington]] at the [[National Academy of Sciences]]) (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than "behaviour control technologies", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

{{cquote|If [[genocide]] is indeed the dream of modern power, this is not because of the recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sexuality'' Volume 1 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Milieu intérieur'' ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project namely the [[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]] (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;296 p.&amp;nbsp;308 Note 14 2007&lt;/ref&gt; political economy and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;29-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (''arcana imperii,'' from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by [[Jean Bodin]]. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insist; in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'),the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'.In which Foucault mentions a group called ''The Ideologues'' where the term ''[[Ideology]]'' first appears and is taken from.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCaffery ''Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They?'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, pp.&amp;nbsp;83&amp;ndash;84, note&amp;nbsp;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is through 'regimes of truth' Foucault argues that [[raison d'état]] achieves its political and biological success.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;78, p.&amp;nbsp;283, notes&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio-and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions belonging to the early Middle Ages.

One major thinker which forms a parallel with Foucault’s own work is the Medieval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;ndash;29 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy'' 5 pp.&amp;nbsp;9&amp;ndash;18 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discipline and Punish'' p.&amp;nbsp;330 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Golczewski ''Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law'' Universitas 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the [[body politic]] (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term [[Corporation]] which would later become known to us as [[capitalism]], an economic category).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz ''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;273&amp;ndash;313 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz also refers to the [[Glossator]]'s belonging to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The [[Lords Appellant]] and the commentaries of jurist [[Edmund Plowden]]&lt;ref&gt;The commentaries, or Reports of [[Edmund Plowden]] 1561&lt;/ref&gt; and his Plowden Reports.&lt;ref&gt;Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kantorowicz analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the [[hereditary succession]] of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order ([[Politicians]]) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.&lt;ref&gt;''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;42&amp;ndash;78 and pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;107 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the democratisation of [[Sovereignty]], which is known in modern political terms as "[[Liberal democracy]]". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears(with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the [[Nobility]]—in an uneasy Medieval alliance and at times, it appeared fractious.&lt;ref&gt;According to Sidney Madge the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom, Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.''The Domesday Of Crown Lands'', pp. 20–21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of Madge's information comes from [[Charles Henry Pearson]] meticulous study of the [[domesday]] records.{{Cite book|title=History Of England During The Early Middles Ages Volume 1 1867|last=Charles Henry Pearson|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}. Madge places the barons majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%) by the time of the [[Norman conquest]] the monarch of the day—according to Madge analysis of Pearson's work the king wasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065 before the conquest and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful [[Roman Catholic]] church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy, and auditing system based on the basic premise: what was the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the whole kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case means the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King known as the [[Barons of the exchequer]], run, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp.&amp;nbsp;20&amp;ndash;21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see [[Barons war]].

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the prime minister, one could argue is it irony or fierce logic that dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the new founded urban population in the form of production and [[Political power]] that it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking over and ultimately giving the [[Nation state]] not only its rationale but its "governing less" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity giving the machine (Foucault uses the term [[Dispositif]]) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence.

Foucault makes special note on the biological "naturalness" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this "naturalness" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with [[Georges Canguilhem]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-27, see notes 37&amp;ndash;38, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics ([[Classical mechanics]]) via [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of "milieu Newtonian" physics used by [[Isaac Newton]] and the Newtonians.&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;20, pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and "natural" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and [[natural law]] (scientific [[Jurisprudence]]), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the ''[[Economist|économistes]]''&lt;ref&gt;officially known as the [[Physiocrats]], see ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;53, pp.&amp;nbsp;55-86, p.&amp;nbsp;52, note&amp;nbsp;17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Vincent de Gournay]], [[François Quesnay]], [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]], and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]])&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention of [[Vincent de Gournay]] in Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;51, note&amp;nbsp;15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;333&amp;ndash;61, pp.&amp;nbsp;348&amp;ndash;49, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who continued with the rationalization of this "naturalness". Foucault notices that this "naturalness" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement "population" and their (political population) association with raison d'état.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, p.&amp;nbsp;81, note&amp;nbsp;19, and pp.&amp;nbsp;285&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Function'''  [[Maize]] gene for first step in biosynthesis of [[DIMBOA|benzoxazin]], which aids in resistance to insect pests, pathogenic fungi and bacteria.

'''First report'''  Hamilton 1964,&lt;ref name=Hamilton64&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=RH|title=A corn mutant deficient in 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one with an altered tolerance of atrazine|journal=Weeds|year=1964|volume=12|pages=27–30|jstor=4040633}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mutant sensitive to the herbicide [[atrazine]], and lacking benzoxazinoids (less than 1% of non-mutant plants).

[[Mutations]] in the bx1 gene reduce the resistance to first generation [[European corn borer]] that is conferred by [[DIMBOA|benzoxazinoids]]. Molecular characterization reveals that the BX1 protein is a [[Sequence homology|homologue]] to the alpha-subunit of [[tryptophan synthase]]. The reference mutant [[allele]] has a deletion of about 900 bp, located at the 5'-terminus and comprising sequence upstream of the transcription start site and the first [[exon]]. A second mutant allele is given by a ''Mu'' [[transposon]] insertion in the fourth exon (Frey et al. 1997&lt;ref name=Frey97&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=M |author2=Chomet, P |author3=Glawischnig, E |author4=Stettner, C |author5=Grün, S |author6=Winklmair, A |author7=Eisenreich, W |author8=Bacher, A |author9=Meeley, RB |author10=Briggs, SP |author11=Simcox, K |author12=Gierl, A|title=Analysis of a chemical plant defense mechanism in grasses.|journal=Science|date=Aug 1, 1997|volume=277|issue=5326|pages=696–9|pmid=9235894|doi=10.1126/science.277.5326.696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). [[Gene sequence]] diversity analysis has been performed for 281 inbred lines of maize, and the results suggest that bx1 is responsible for much of the natural variation in DIMBOA (a benzoxazinoid compound) synthesis (Butron et al. 2010).&lt;ref name=Butron10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butrón|first=A|author2=Chen, YC |author3=Rottinghaus, GE |author4= McMullen, MD |title=Genetic variation at bx1 controls DIMBOA content in maize.|journal=TAG.

[[File:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman holding a prayer wheel demonstrates the continuity theory. Despite their age, older adults generally maintain the same traditions and beliefs.]]The '''continuity theory''' of normal [[Aging (life cycle)|aging]] states that older adults will usually maintain the same activities, [[behavior]]s, [[Social relationship|relationships]] as they did in their earlier years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=American Society on Aging | title=Continuity theory: How elders find wisdom in spite of it all | url=http://www.asaging.org/at/at-214/continuity.html | accessdate=2007-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this [[theory]], older adults try to maintain this continuity of lifestyle by adapting strategies that are connected to their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Atchley R. C. |year= 1989 |title= A continuity theory of normal aging |journal= The Gerontologist |volume= 29 |pages= 183–190 | issue=2 |pmid=2519525 |doi=10.1093/geront/29.2.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuity theory is one of three major psychosocial theories which describe how people develop in old age.&lt;ref name="Ebersole2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Priscilla Ebersole|title=Gerontological nursing and healthy aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUlB72lFtIIC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=8 April 2005|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-03165-3|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two psychosocial theories are the [[disengagement theory]], with which the continuity theory comes to odds, and the [[Activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] upon which the continuity theory modifies and elaborates. Unlike the other two theories, the continuity theory uses a life course perspective to define normal aging.

The continuity theory can be classified as a micro-level theory because it pertains to the individual, and more specifically it can be viewed from the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist perspective]] in which the individual and society try to obtain a state of [[Social equilibrium|equilibrium]].

==History==
The continuity theory originated in the observation that a large proportion of older adults show consistency in their activities, personalities, and relationships despite their changing physical, mental, and [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Theory_history"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Richard Schulz |editor2=Linda S. Noelker |editor3=Kenneth Rockwood |editor4=Richard L. Sprott | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aging| title = Continuity Theory| edition = 4th| year = 2006| publisher = Springer Publishing Company| volume = 1| isbn = 0-8261-4843-3| pages = 266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, George L. Maddox gave an [[empiricism|empirical]] description of the theory in a chapter of the book ''Middle Age and Aging: A Reader in Social Psychology'' called "Persistence of life style among the elderly: A [[longitudinal study]] of patterns of social activity in relation to [[life satisfaction]]". The continuity theory was formerly proposed in 1971 by Robert Atchley in his article "Retirement and Leisure Participation: Continuity or Crisis?" in the journal ''The Gerontologist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Profiles in Gerontology: A Biographical Dictionary |last= Achenbaum |first= W. Andrew |authorlink= |author2=Daniel M. Albert |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood Press  |location= |isbn=0-313-29274-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1989, he published another article entitled "A Continuity Theory of Normal Aging, in ''The Gerontologist'' in which he substantially developed the theory. In this article, he expanded the continuity theory to explain the development of internal and external structures of continuity. In 1999, Robert Atchley continued to strengthen his theory in his book ''Continuity and Adaptation in Aging: Creating Positive Experiences''.&lt;ref name="Theory_history"/&gt;

==Elements==
The theory deals with the internal structure and the external structure of continuity to describe how people adapt to their situation and set their goals. The internal structure of an individual such as [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[idea]]s, and [[belief]]s remain constant throughout the life course. This provides the individual a way to make future decisions based on their internal foundation of the past. The external structure of an individual such as [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[role|social roles]] provides a support for maintaining a stable [[self-concept]]  and lifestyle.

==Criticisms and weaknesses==
The major criticism for the theory is its definition of normal aging.&lt;ref name="Criticisms"&gt;{{cite book |title= Aging and The Life Course: An Introduction to Social Gerontology |last= Quadagno |first= Jill |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages  |location= |edition=4th |isbn=0-07-352816-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory distinguishes normal aging from pathological aging, neglecting the older adults with chronic illness.

The [[Feminist theory|feminist theories]] criticise the continuity theory for defining normal aging around a male model.&lt;ref name="Criticisms"/&gt;

Another weakness of the theory is that it fails to demonstrate how social institutions impact the individuals and the way they age.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Dermatophyte test medium''' (DTM) is a specialized [[agar]] used in medical [[mycology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neogen.com/Acumedia/pdf/ProdInfo/7265_PI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bd.com/ds/technicalCenter/inserts/8814091%2803%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[Sabouraud's dextrose agar]] with added [[cycloheximide]] to inhibit [[saprotrophic]] growth, [[antibiotic]] to inhibit [[bacterial]] growth, and phenol red a [[pH]] indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a [[dermatophyte]] [[fungus]], which utilizes [[nitrogen]]ous material for preferred metabolism, producing [[alkaline]] by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize [[carbohydrate]]s in the medium producing [[acidic]] by-products and no red color change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59546">An '''epigenetic clock''' is a type of a [[Biomarkers of aging|molecular age estimation method]] based on [[DNA methylation]] levels. Pre-eminent examples for epigenetic clocks are '''[[Steve Horvath|Horvath]]'s clock''',&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; which applies to all human tissues/cells, and '''Hannum's clock''',&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which applies to blood.

==History==
The strong effects of age on DNA methylation levels have been known since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Berdyshev1967"/&gt; A vast literature describes sets of [[CpG site|CpGs]] whose DNA methylation levels correlate with age, e.g.&lt;ref name="Rakyan2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teschendorff2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell2012"/&gt; The first robust demonstration that DNA methylation levels in saliva could generate accurate age predictors was published by a [[UCLA]] team including [[Steve Horvath]] in 2011 (Bocklandt et al 2011).&lt;ref name="Bocklandt2011" /&gt; The labs of Trey Ideker and Kang Zhang at the [[University of California, San Diego]] published the Hannum epigenetic clock (Hannum 2013),&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which consisted of 71 markers that accurately estimate age based on blood methylation levels. 
The first multi-tissue epigenetic clock, Horvath's epigenetic clock, was developed by [[Steve Horvath]], a professor of [[human genetics]]  and of [[biostatistics]] at [[UCLA]] (Horvath 2013).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt; Horvath spent over 4 years collecting publicly available Illumina DNA methylation data and identifying suitable statistical methods.&lt;ref name="Biome2013"/&gt; The personal story behind the discovery was featured in Nature.&lt;ref name="Gibbs2014"/&gt; The age estimator was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. The major innovation of Horvath's epigenetic clock lies in its wide applicability: the same set of 353 CpGs and the same prediction algorithm is used irrespective of the DNA source within the organism, i.e. it does not require any adjustments or offsets.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; This property allows one to compare the ages of different areas of the human body using the same aging clock.

==Relationship to a cause of biological aging==
It is not yet known what exactly is measured by DNA methylation age. Horvath hypothesized that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system but details are unknown. The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christiansen2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"/&gt; strongly suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=DNA methylation-based measures of biological age: meta-analysis predicting time to death|url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/101020|journal=Aging|volume=8|pages=1844–1865|doi=10.18632/aging.101020|pmc=5076441|pmid=27690265|via=|doi-access=Free|vauthors=Chen B, Marioni R, Colicino E, Peters M, Ward-Caviness C, Tsai P, Roetker N, Just A, Demerath E, Guan W|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that the 353 clock CpGs are special or play a direct causal role in the aging process.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Rather, the epigenetic clock captures an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of the epigenome.

===Epigenetic clock theory of aging===
Horvath and Raj &lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"/&gt; proposed an epigenetic clock theory of aging with the following tenets:
* Biological aging results as an unintended consequence of both developmental programs and maintenance program, the molecular footprints of which give rise to DNA methylation age estimators. 
* The precise mechanisms linking the innate molecular processes (underlying DNAm age) to the decline in tissue function probably relate to both intracellular changes (leading to a loss of cellular identity) and subtle changes in cell composition, for example, fully functioning somatic stem cells. 
* At the molecular level, DNAm age is a proximal readout of a collection of innate aging processes that conspire with other, independent root causes of ageing to the detriment of tissue function.

==Motivation for biological clocks==
In general, biological aging clocks and [[biomarkers of aging]]  are expected to find many uses in biological research since age is a fundamental characteristic of most [[organisms]]. Accurate measures of biological age ('''biological aging clocks''') could be useful for
* testing the validity of various [[theories of biological aging]],
* diagnosing various age related [[disease]]s and for defining [[cancer]] subtypes,
* predicting/prognosticating  the onset of various diseases,
* serving as [[surrogate marker]]s for evaluating therapeutic interventions including  [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]  approaches,
* studying [[developmental biology]] and [[cell differentiation]],
* [[forensic]] applications, for example to estimate the age of a suspect based on blood left on a crime scene.
Overall, biological clocks are expected to be useful for studying what causes aging and what can be done against it.

==Properties of Horvath's clock==
The clock is defined as an age estimation method based on 353 [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] markers on the DNA. The 353 markers measure [[DNA methylation]] of [[CpG dinucleotide]]s. Estimated age ("predicted age" in mathematical usage), also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s; second, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues (which are used as human analogs for biological testing purposes). Organismal growth (and concomitant cell division) leads to a high ticking rate of the epigenetic clock that slows down to a constant ticking rate (linear dependence) after adulthood (age 20).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;
The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life even after adjusting for known risk factors &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt; suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging. Similarly, markers of physical and mental fitness are associated with the epigenetic clock (lower abilities associated with age acceleration).&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt;

Salient features of Horvath's epigenetic clock include its high accuracy and its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Since it allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same subject, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of accelerated age due to disease.

===Statistical approach===
The basic approach is to form a weighted average of the 353 clock CpGs, which is then transformed to DNAm age using a calibration function. The calibration function reveals that the epigenetic clock has a high ticking rate until adulthood, after which it slows to a constant ticking rate. Using the training data sets, Horvath used a penalized regression model ([[Elastic net regularization]]) to regress a calibrated version of chronological age on 21,369 CpG probes that were present both on the Illumina 450K and 27K platform and had fewer than 10 missing values. DNAm age is defined as estimated ("predicted") age. The elastic net predictor automatically selected 353 CpGs. 193 of the 353 CpGs correlate positively with age while the remaining 160 CpGs correlate negatively with age. R software and a freely available web-based tool can be found  at the following webpage.&lt;ref name="DNAmAgeSoftware"/&gt;

===Accuracy===
The median error of estimated age is 3.6 years across a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types
.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;  The epigenetic clock performs well in heterogeneous tissues (for example, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cerebellar samples, occipital cortex, buccal epithelium, colon, adipose, kidney, liver, lung, saliva, uterine cervix, epidermis, muscle) as well as in individual cell types such as CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, glial cells, neurons, immortalized B cells, mesenchymal stromal cells.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; However, accuracy depends to some extent on the source of the DNA.

=== Comparison with other biological clocks ===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
The epigenetic clock leads to a chronological age prediction that has a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] of r=0.96 with chronological age (Figure 2 in &lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;). Thus the age correlation is close to its maximum possible correlation value of 1.  Other biological clocks are based on a) [[telomere]] length, b) [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels (also known as INK4a/ARF locus),&lt;ref name="Collado2007"/&gt; and c) [[microsatellite]] mutations.&lt;ref name="Forster2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forster | first1 = P | last2 = Hohoff | first2 = C | last3 = Dunkelmann | first3 = B | last4 = Schürenkamp | first4 = M | last5 = Pfeiffer | first5 = H | last6 = Neuhuber | first6 = F | last7 = Brinkmann | first7 = B | year = 2015 | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1803/20142898.long | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 282 | issue = | page = 20142898 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 | pmid=25694621 | pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between chronological age and [[telomere]] length is r=−0.51 in women and r=−0.55 in men.&lt;ref name="Nordfjall2010"/&gt; The correlation between chronological age and expression levels of [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] in T cells is r=0.56.&lt;ref name="Wang2012"/&gt; {{citation needed span|text=[[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels only relate to age in [[T cell]]s, a type of white blood cells.|date=December 2016}} {{citation needed span|text=The microsatellite clock measures not chronological age but age in terms of elapsed cell divisions within a tissue.|date=December 2016}}

==Applications of Horvath's clock==
By contrasting DNA methylation age (estimated age) with chronological age, one can define measures of age acceleration. Age acceleration can be defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age. Alternatively, it can be defined as the residual that results from regressing DNAm age on chronological age. The latter measure is attractive because it does not correlate with chronological age.
A positive/negative value of epigenetic age acceleration suggests that the underlying tissue ages faster/slower than expected.

===Genetic studies of epigenetic age acceleration===
The broad sense heritability (defined via [[Falconer's formula]]) of age acceleration of blood from older subjects is around 40% but it appears to be much higher in newborns.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
Similarly, the age acceleration of brain tissue (prefrontal cortex) was found to be 41% in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Levine2015"/&gt;
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of epigenetic age acceleration in postmortem brain samples have identified
several [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] at a genomewide significance level.&lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu2017"/&gt;
GWAS of age acceleration in blood have identified several genome-wide significant genetic loci including the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus
.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"&gt;Lu AT., &amp; Xue L., &amp; Chen BH., et al., Horvath S. (2018). [
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29374233/
GWAS of epigenetic aging rates in blood reveals a critical role for TERT]. Nat Comm{{ doi|10.1038/s41467-017-02697-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in TERT gene paradoxically confer higher epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"/&gt;

===Lifestyle factors===
In general, lifestyle factors have only weak effects on epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"&gt;Quach A., &amp; Levine ME., &amp; Tanaka T.,…., &amp; Horvath S. (2018). [
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5361673/
Epigenetic clock analysis of diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle factors.]. Aging (Albany NY){{ doi|
10.18632/aging.101168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, cross sectional studies of extrinsic epigenetic aging rates in blood confirm the conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of education, eating a high plant diet with lean meats, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity and the risks associated with [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic syndrome]].

===Obesity and metabolic syndrome===
The epigenetic clock was used to study the relationship between high [[body mass index]] (BMI) and the DNA methylation ages of human blood, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2014obesity"/&gt; A significant correlation (r=0.42) between BMI and epigenetic age acceleration could be observed for the liver. A much larger sample size (n=4200 blood samples) revealed a weak but statistically significant correlation (r=0.09) between BMI and intrinsic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; The same large study found that various biomarkers of [[metabolic syndrome]] (glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]) were associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; Conversely, high levels of the good cholesterol [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] were associated with a lower epigenetic aging rate of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt;

===Female breast tissue is older than expected===
DNAm age is higher than chronological age in female breast tissue that is adjacent to breast cancer tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Since normal tissue which is adjacent to other cancer types does not exhibit a similar age acceleration effect, this finding suggests that normal female breast tissue ages faster than other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Similarly, normal breast tissue samples from women without cancer have been found to be substantially older than blood samples collected from the same women at the same time {{PMID|28364215}}.

===Cancer tissue===
Cancer tissues show both positive and negative age acceleration effects. For most tumor types, no significant relationship can be observed between age acceleration and tumor morphology (grade/stage).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt; On average, cancer tissues with mutated [[P53|TP53]] have a lower age acceleration than those without it.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Further, cancer tissues  with high age acceleration tend to have fewer somatic mutations than those with low age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;
Age acceleration is highly related to various genomic aberrations in cancer tissues. Somatic mutations in [[estrogen receptor]]s or [[progesterone receptor]]s are associated with accelerated DNAm age in breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Colorectal cancer samples with a [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] (V600E) mutation or promoter hypermethylation of the mismatch repair gene [[MLH1]] are associated with an increased age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Age acceleration in [[glioblastoma multiforme]] samples is highly significantly associated with certain mutations in [[H3F3A]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
One study suggests that the epigenetic age of blood tissue may be prognostic of lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name="Levine2015lungcancer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = M  | date = 2015 | title = DNA methylation age of blood predicts future onset of lung cancer in the women's health initiative.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n9/full/100809.html | journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = | pages =690–700| pmid= 26411804 | pmc=4600626 | doi=10.18632/aging.100809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)===
[[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome (DS)]] entails an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age. The clinical manifestations of accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis has been sparse. According to the epigenetic clock, trisomy 21 significantly increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome"/&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease related neuropathology===
Epigenetic age acceleration of the human prefrontal cortex was found to be correlated with several neuropathological measurements that play a role in Alzheimer's disease &lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;  Further, it was found to be associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning, and memory functioning among individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;
The epigenetic age of '''blood''' relates to cognitive functioning in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt; Overall, these results strongly suggest that the epigenetic clock lends itself for measuring the biological age of the brain.

===Cerebellum ages slowly===
It has been difficult to identify tissues that seem to evade aging due to the lack of biomarkers of tissue age that allow one to contrast compare the ages of different tissues. An application of epigenetic clock to 30 anatomic sites from six centenarians and younger subjects revealed that the [[cerebellum]] ages slowly: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; This finding might explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. In younger subjects (e.g. younger than 70), brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; Several SNPs and genes have been identified that relate to the epigenetic age of the cerebellum &lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;

===Huntington's disease===
[[Huntington's disease]] has been found to increase the epigenetic aging rates of several human brain regions.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016HD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2016 | title = Huntington's disease accelerates epigenetic aging of human brain and disrupts DNA methylation levels

===Centenarians age slowly===
The offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in blood) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| url =
http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100861.html| journal = Aging | volume = | issue = Dec| pages =| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV infection===
Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ([[HIV]]) is associated with clinical symptoms of accelerated aging, as evidenced by increased incidence and diversity of age-related illnesses at relatively young ages. But it has been difficult to detect an accelerated aging effect on a molecular level. An epigenetic clock analysis of human DNA from HIV+ subjects and controls detected a significant age acceleration effect in brain (7.4 years) and blood (5.2 years) tissue due to HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015HIV"/&gt; These results are consistent with an independent study that also found an age advancement of 5 years in blood of HIV patients and a strong effect of the HLA locus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Andrew M.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Philipp A.|last3=Kreisberg|first3=Jason F.|last4=Licon|first4=Katherine|last5=Jepsen|first5=Kristen L.|last6=Khosroheidari|first6=Mahdieh|last7=Morsey|first7=Brenda M.|last8=Swindells|first8=Susan|last9=Shen|first9=Hui|date= 2016-04-21|title=Methylome-wide Analysis of Chronic HIV Infection Reveals Five-Year Increase in Biological Age and Epigenetic Targeting of HLA|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.03.019|issn=1097-4164|pmc=4995115|pmid=27105112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
A large-scale study suggests that the blood of Parkinson's disease subjects exhibits (relatively weak) accelerated aging effects.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =| pages =  1130–42| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental disorder: syndrome X===
Children with a very rare disorder known as [[Brooke Greenberg|syndrome X]] maintain the façade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood. Since the physical development of these children is dramatically delayed, these children appear to be a toddler or at best a preschooler. According to an epigenetic clock analysis, blood tissue from syndrome X cases is not younger than expected.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015syndromeX"/&gt;

===Menopause accelerates epigenetic aging===
The following results strongly suggest that the loss of female hormones resulting from menopause accelerates the epigenetic aging rate of blood and possibly that of other tissues.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; First, early [[menopause]] has been found to be associated with an increased epigenetic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Second, surgical menopause (due to bilateral
[[oophorectomy]]) is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood and saliva. Third, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone therapy]], which mitigates hormonal loss, is associated with a negative age acceleration of buccal cells (but not of blood cells).&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Fourth, genetic markers that are associated with early menopause are also associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt;

===Cellular senescence versus epigenetic aging===
A confounding aspect of biological aging is the nature and role of senescent cells. It is unclear whether the three major types of cellular senescence, namely replicative senescence, oncogene-induced senescence and DNA damage-induced senescence are descriptions of the same phenomenon instigated by different sources, or if each of these is distinct, and how they are associated with epigenetic aging.
Induction of replicative senescence (RS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) were found to be accompanied by epigenetic aging of primary cells but senescence induced by DNA damage was not, even though RS and OIS activate the cellular DNA damage response pathway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 =D | year = 2016 | title = Epigenetic clock analyses of cellular senescence and ageing. | url =
http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/index.php?journal=oncotarget&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=7383| journal = Oncotarget | volume=7| issue =8| pages = 8524–8531 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.7383| pmid=26885756  | pmc=4890984}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results highlight the independence of cellular senescence from epigenetic aging. Consistent with this, telomerase-immortalised cells continued to age (according to the epigenetic clock) without having been treated with any senescence inducers or DNA-damaging agents, re-affirming the independence of the process of epigenetic ageing from telomeres, cellular senescence, and the DNA damage response pathway.
Although the uncoupling of senescence from cellular aging appears at first sight to be inconsistent with the fact that senescent cells contribute to the physical manifestation of organism ageing, as demonstrated by Baker et al., where removal of senescent cells slowed down aging.&lt;ref name="Baker2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 =DJ | year = 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders. | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10600.html
| journal = Nature | volume=479| issue =7372| pages = 232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600| pmid= 22048312  | pmc=3468323}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the epigenetic clock analysis of senescence suggests that cellular senescence is a state that cells are forced into as a result of external pressures such as DNA damage, ectopic oncogene expression and exhaustive proliferation of cells to replenish those eliminated by external/environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt; These senescent cells, in sufficient numbers, will probably cause the deterioration of tissues, which is interpreted as organism ageing. However, at the cellular level, aging, as measured by the epigenetic clock, is distinct from senescence. It is an intrinsic mechanism that exists from the birth of the cell and continues. This implies that if cells are not shunted into senescence by the external pressures described above, they would still continue to age. This is consistent with the fact that mice with naturally long telomeres still age and eventually die even though their telomere lengths are far longer than the critical limit, and they age prematurely when their telomeres are forcibly shortened, due to replicative senescence. Therefore, cellular senescence is a route by which cells exit prematurely from the natural course of cellular aging.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt;

===Effect of sex and race/ethnicity===
Men age faster than women according to epigenetic age acceleration in blood, brain, saliva, and many other tissues.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = An epigenetic clock analysis of race/ethnicity, sex, and coronary heart disease.| journal = [[Genome Biol]]| volume =17  | issue = 1| year = 2016| pmid = 27511193  |pmc= 4980791|vauthors= Horvath S, Gurven M, Levine ME, Trumble BC, Kaplan H, Allayee H, Ritz BR, Chen B, Lu AT, Rickabaugh TM, Jamieson BD, Sun D, Li S, Chen W, Quintana-Murci L, Fagny M, Kobor MS, Tsao PS, Reiner AP, Edlefsen KL, Absher D, Assimes TL | doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1030-0| pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The epignetic clock method applies to all examined racial/ethnic groups in the sense that DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age. But ethnicity can be associated with epigenetic age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt; For example, the blood of Hispanics and the [[Tsimané people|Tsimané]] ages more slowly than that of other populations which might explain the [[Hispanic paradox|Hispanic mortality paradox]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt;

===Rejuvenation effect due to stem cell transplantation in blood===
[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], which transplants these cells from a young donor to an older recipient, rejuvenates the epigenetic age of blood to that of the donor {{PMID| 28550187}}. However, [[graft-versus-host disease]] is associated with increased DNA methyhlation age {{PMID| 28550187}}.

===Progeria===
Adult progeria also known as [[Werner syndrome]] is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Maierhofer2017Werner"/&gt;
Fibroblast samples from childen with Hutchinson-Gilford [[Progeria]] exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the "skin &amp; blood" epigenetic clock but not according to the original pan tissue clock from Horvath.

==Biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock==
Despite the fact that biomarkers of ageing based on DNA methylation data have enabled accurate age estimates for any tissue across the entire life course, the precise biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"&gt;Horvath, S., &amp; Raj, K. (2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0004-3  DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing]. Nature Reviews Genetics, {{doi|10.1038/s41576-018-0004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, epigenetic biomarkers may help to address long-standing questions in many fields, including the central question: why do we age?  The following explanations have been proposed in the literature.

===Possible explanation 1: Epigenomic maintenance system===
Horvath hypothesized that his clock arises from a methylation footprint left by an epigenomic maintenance system.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;

===Possible explanation 2: Unrepaired DNA damages===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Endogenous DNA damages occur frequently including about 50 double-strand DNA breaks per cell cycle&lt;ref name="pmid14566050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vilenchik MM, Knudson AG |title=Endogenous DNA double-strand breaks: production, fidelity of repair, and induction of cancer |journal=Proc.

Accumulation of epigenetic alterations may parallel the accumulation of un-repaired DNA damages that are proposed to cause aging (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

==Other age estimators based on DNA methylation levels==
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Several other age estimators have been described in the literature.

1) Weidner et al. (2014) describe an age estimator for DNA from blood that uses only three CpG sites of genes hardly affected by aging (cg25809905 in integrin, alpha 2b (ITGA2B); cg02228185 in aspartoacylase (ASPA) and cg17861230 in phosphodiesterase 4C, cAMP specific (PDE4C)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weidner | first1 = C. I. | last2 = Lin | first2 = Q. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Eisele | first4 = L. | last5 = Beier | first5 = F. | last6 = Ziegler | first6 = P. | last7 = Wagner | first7 = W. | year = 2014 | title = Aging of blood can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at just three CpG sites | url = http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/2/R24 | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2| page = R24 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r24 | pmid=24490752 | pmc=4053864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The age estimator by Weidener et al. (2014) applies only to blood. Even in blood this sparse estimator is far less accurate than Horvath's epigenetic clock (Horvath 2014) when applied to data generated by the Illumina 27K or 450K platforms.

&lt;/ref&gt; But the sparse estimator was developed for pyrosequencing data and is highly cost effective.

&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Hannum et al. (2013) &lt;ref name="Hannum2013"/&gt; report several age estimators: one for each tissue type. Each of these estimators requires covariate information (e.g. gender, body mass index, batch). The authors mention that each tissue led to a clear linear offset (intercept and slope). Therefore, the authors had to adjust the blood-based age estimator for each tissue type using a linear model. When the Hannum estimator is applied to other tissues, it leads to a high error (due to poor calibration) as can be seen from Figure 4A in Hannum et al. (2013). Hannum et al. adjusted their blood-based age estimator (by adjusting the slope and the intercept term) in order to apply it to other tissue types. Since this adjustment step removes differences between tissue, the blood-based estimator from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different tissues/organs. In contrast, a salient characteristic of the epigenetic clock  is that one does not have to carry out such a calibration step:&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; it always uses the same CpGs and the same coefficient values. Therefore, Horvath's epigenetic clock can be used to compare the ages of different tissues/cells/organs from the same individual. While the age estimators from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different normal tissues, they can be used to compare the age of a cancerous tissue with that of a corresponding normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Hannum et al. reported pronounced age acceleration effects in all cancers. In contrast, Horvath's epigenetic clock &lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R115/comments Horvath S (2013-11-04 11:00) Erratum in cancer tissues  Reader Comment]
&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that some cancer types (e.g. triple negative breast cancers or uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) exhibit negative age acceleration, i.e. cancer tissue can be much younger than expected.
An important difference relates to additional covariates. Hannum's age estimators make use of covariates such as gender, body mass index, diabetes status, ethnicity, and batch. Since new data involve different batches, one cannot apply it directly to new data. However, the authors present coefficient values for their CpGs in Supplementary Tables which can be used to define an aggregate measure that tends to be strongly correlated with chronological age but may be poorly calibrated (i.e. lead to high errors).

3.) Giuliani et al. identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in human teeth. They propose the evaluation of DNA methylation at ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes in DNA recovered from both cementum and pulp of the same modern teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giuliani | first1 = C. | last2 = Cilli | first2 = E. | last3 = Bacalini | first3 = M.

In a multicenter benchmarking study 18 research groups from three continents compared all promising methods for analyzing DNA methylation in the clinic and identified the most accurate methods, having concluded that epigenetic tests based on DNA methylation are a mature technology ready for broad clinical use.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Bock et al.

They found that mice treated with lifespan-extending interventions (surch as calorie restriction or dietary rapamycin) were significantly younger in epigenetic age than their untreated, wild-type age-matched controls. Mice age predictors also detects the longevity effects of gene knockouts, and rejuvenation of fibroblast-derived iPSCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Ethnoornithology''' (also ethno-ornithology) is the study of the relationship between [[person|people]] and [[birds]] (from "[[Ethnology|ethno-]]" - relating to people and culture - and "[[ornithology]]" - the study of birds). It is a branch of [[ethnozoology]] and so of the wider field of [[ethnobiology]]. Ethnoornithology is an interdisciplinary subject and combines [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] perspectives with [[natural science|natural scientific]] approaches to the description and interpretation of people's knowledge and use of birds. Like [[ethnomethodology|ethnoscience]] and other cognate terms, "ethnoornithology" is sometimes used narrowly to refer to people's practice rather than the study of that practice. The broader focus is on how birds are perceived, used and managed in [[human]] [[society|societies]], including their use for [[food]], [[medicine]] and personal [[beauty|adornment]], as well as their use in [[divination]] and [[ritual]]. Applied ethnoornithological research is also starting to play an increasingly important role in the development of [[conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives.

== History of ethnoornithology ==
The work of [[Ralph Bulmer]] in [[New Guinea]], culminating in his collaboration with Ian Saem Majnep in writing ''Birds of My Kalam Country'' (1977), set a new standard for ethnoornithological research, and this book has deservedly become a classic of modern ethnoornithology.

== Approaches to ethnoornithology ==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

== Ethnoornithology and conservation ==
Like other branches of ethnozoology, ethnoornithology has been long undervalued as a resource for [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/biodiversity-and-linguistic-diversity/ conservation], though this is now beginning to change. Mark Bonta's ''Seven Names for the Bellbird'' (2003), which highlights the importance of local traditions and practices relating to birds for the future of biodiversity conservation in Honduras, and Ricardo Rozzi´s ''Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America'' (2003), which focuses on the integration of traditional ornithological knowledge and environmental ethics in southern Chile, provide good examples of this trend. Soma (2015) pointed out that ethnoornithological knowledge of falconers contribute to conservation for local avifauna (especially focusing on Kazakh eagle masters). This realisation is the basis for founding the [http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/egi/research-at-the-egi/ethno-ornithology-world-archive-ewa/ Ethno-ornithology World Archive (EWA)], a collaborative project between Oxford University (linking the Department of Zoology and School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography) and [[BirdLife International]].

== Professional associations ==
The [http://ethnobiology.org Society of Ethnobiology], which publishes the ''Journal of Ethnobiology'', provides a general forum for ethnobiological - including ethnoornthological - research. In January 2006 the [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/ethnoornithology/ Ethnoornithology Research &amp; Study Group (ERSG)] was established "to provide a clearinghouse, information source and discussion point for people interested in the study of, research about and application of indigenous bird knowledge".

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

The '''Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey''', or '''GOODS''', is an [[astronomical survey]] combining deep observations from three of [[NASA]]'s [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]: the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], along with data from other [[Space observatory|space-based telescopes]], such as [[XMM Newton]], and some of the world's most powerful ground-based telescopes.

GOODS is intended to enable astronomers to study the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]] in the distant, early universe.

[[File:Galaxy history revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope (GOODS-ERS2).jpg|thumb|center|600px|GOODS Field (Hubble component)]]

The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey consists of optical and near-infrared imaging taken with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Very Large Telescope]] and the 4-m telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]; [[infrared]] data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].  These are added to pre-existing x-ray data from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[ESA]]s [[XMM-Newton]], two fields of 10' by 16'; one centered on the [[Hubble Deep Field]] North (12h 36m 55s, +62° 14m 15s) and the other on the [[Chandra Deep Field South]] (3h 32m 30s, -27° 48m 20s).  

The two GOODS fields are the most data-rich areas of the sky in terms of depth and wavelength coverage.

==Instruments==
[[File:GOODS-South field.jpg|thumb|Composite image of the GOODS-South field, result of a deep survey using two of the four giant 8.2-metre telescopes composing [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]]]]

GOODS consists of data from the following space-based observatories:
*The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (optical imaging with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]])
*The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] ([[infrared]] imaging)
*The [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] ([[X-ray]])
*[[XMM-Newton]] (an X-ray telescope belonging to the [[European Space Agency]])
*The [[Herschel Space Observatory]] (an infrared telescope belonging to the ESA)

==Hubble Space Telescope images==
GOODs used the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] with four filters, centered at 435, 606, 775 and 850&amp;nbsp;nm. The resulting map covers 30 times the area of the [[Hubble Deep Field]] to a photometric magnitude less sensitivity, and has enough resolution to allow the study of 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|kpc]]-scale objects at redshifts up to 6. It also provides photometric redshifts for over 60,000 galaxies within the field, providing an excellent sample for studying bright galaxies at high redshifts.&lt;ref name="Beckwith2006"&gt;{{cite journal

==Herschel==
In May 2010, scientists announced that the [[infrared]] data from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] was joining the GOODS dataset, after initial analysis of data using Herschel's [[Herschel Space Observatory#Instrumentation|PACS and SPIRE]] instruments. In October 2009, Herschel observed the GOODS-North field, and in January 2010 the GOODS-South field. In so doing, Herschel identified sources for the [[Cosmic infrared background|Cosmic Infrared Background]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Herschel_Reveals_Galaxies_In_The_Goods_Fields_In_A_Brand_New_Light_999.html Herschel Reveals Galaxies In The GOODS Fields In A Brand New Light], spacedaily.com, 12 May 2009, accessed 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Het Gulden Cabinet vande Edel Vry Schilder-Const''''' or '''''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting''''' is a book by the 17th-century Flemish notary and ''[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijker]]'' [[Cornelis de Bie]] published in Antwerp.  Written in the [[Dutch language]], it contains artist biographies and [[panegyric]]s with engraved portraits of 16th- and 17th-century artists, predominantly from the [[Southern Netherlands]].  The work is a very important source of information on the artists it describes.  It formed the principal source of information for later art historians such as [[Arnold Houbraken]] and [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].  It was published in 1662, although the work also mentions 1661 as date of publication.

==Background==
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' stands in a long tradition of artist biographies. This tradition goes back to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and was revived during the [[Renaissance]].  In 1550, the Italian [[Giorgio Vasari]] published his ''[[Vite]]'' on the lives of famous artists. [[Karel van Mander]] was the first author to introduce this genre in the Dutch language with his ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' of 1604.  Cornelis de Bie explicitly placed himself in the tradition of van Mander and did what van Mander did for 15th and 16th Netherlandish artists for 17th-century artists.

In his ''Het Gulden Cabinet'', de Bie presents himself as a ''rederijker'' whose duty it is to broadcast the fame of the artists.  By doing so he followed an existing tradition already seen in [[Dominicus Lampsonius]]' 1572 ''Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae Inferioris effigies'' and the Antwerp painter and rederijker [[Alexander van Fornenbergh]]'s 1658 ''Antwerpschen Proteus ofte Cyclopschen Apelles'', which sang the praises of the painter [[Quinten Matsys]].

The concept of ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' did not come from Cornelis de Bie himself, but from the [[Antwerp]] printer [[Jan Meyssen]].  In 1649 Meyssen had already published ''Image de divers hommes'', which contained engraved portraits of famous men, including painters, in imitation of [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''.  Most of the artist portraits in ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' are taken from this ''Image de divers hommes'' and only a few new engravings were made especially for de Bie's work.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

==The work==

===General===
The full title of the work is ''Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const: inhoudende den lof vande vermarste schilders, architecten, beldthouwers ende plaetsnyders, van dese eeuw'', which translates as ''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting: Containing the Praise of the Most Famous Painters, Architects, Sculptors and Engravers of This Century''.  Despite its title, the book also deals with artists from the 16th century.

The work was dedicated to the Antwerp art collector Antoon van Leyen who had provided some of the information for the book and may also have helped finance the publication.&lt;ref name=chr&gt;Christiaan Schuckman. "Bie, Cornelis de." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toon Houdt, ''On the Edge of Truth and Honesty: Principles and Strategies of Fraud and Deceit in the Early Modern Period'', BRILL, 1 Jan, 2002, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Other persons who had provided information on contemporary artists included de Bie’s own father, [[Erasmus Quellinus II]], [[Luigi Primo]] and [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]]’s son Richard.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

===Structure and style===
The book has three parts. The first deals with artists who had died before de Bie's time and relies heavily on van Mander's ''Schilder-boeck''. The second part deals with artists living at the time of de Bie and is mostly based on original research by de Bie and on the comments added to the engravings borrowed from Meyssens' ''Image de divers hommes''. The third part deals with artists who had been omitted in the first two parts and also includes engravers, sculptors, architects, and painters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flandrica.be/items/show/1025/ Het Gulden Cabinet] on Flandrica.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A general treatise on the art of painting is woven into the entire work.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

The book is mainly written in verse, some of them in Latin, and is as a result rather difficult to read today.  There are also some prose sections.  It is over 500 pages long and contains engravings of more than 50 painters derived mainly from Meyssen's earlier work.

==Influence==
While ''The Gulden Cabinet'' never gained the level of popularity of van Mander’s ''Schilder-boeck'', it is an important source of information on Flemish artists of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dic&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/biec Cornelis de Bie] in the Dictionary of Art Historians.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Bie’s most important contribution was to provide a theoretical basis for his appreciation of (then) less valued painting genres such as [[still life]]s, [[genre art|genre painting]], [[portrait]]s and [[landscape art|landscapes]].  He unreservedly praised the artists who practised in these genres.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;
 
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' is included in the ''Basic Library'' of the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]], which contains 1000 works of Dutch-language literature from the Middle Ages to today, which are deemed by its compilers to be of particular importance to Dutch-language literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second edition==
De Bie seems to have planned a second edition of the work, but this was never published.  The hand-written manuscript of de Bie is still extant and is kept at the [[Royal Library of Belgium]].  The manuscript is dated 1672.  In it de Bie mentioned his intention to have a second edition published.  The reason why the second edition was never published is unclear.  It may have been due to the fact that the publisher and promotor of the first edition [[Jan Meyssen]] had died in 1670 and de Bie had difficulty finding another publisher.

==Historical reliability==
Like Vasari and Van Mander before him, de Bie's biographies are interspersed with amusing anecdotes. Although such literary motifs belong to a long rhetorical tradition, many of these stories were labelled "historically unreliable" by leading historians in the 19th century.  Only recently have some of the stories been reinstated.  Since the book was often the only surviving source of information on certain painters, these stories have often been repeated as hard facts about the lives of the painters described.

For instance, Cornelis de Bie postulates certain apprenticeships, which are now considered improbable because the pupil painted in a completely different genre than the teacher.  De Bie's statement that [[Philips Wouwerman]] trained with [[Frans Hals]] was deemed implausible by later historians since Wouwerman painted landscapes with horses and Hals was principally a portrait painter. Some scholars still consider this apprenticeship as unlikely, but in view of Hals' large workshop it cannot be entirely excluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="567">In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''hybrid balance''' is an expression of the degree of electrical symmetry between two [[impedance matching|impedances]] connected to two conjugate sides of a [[hybrid coil]] or [[resistance hybrid]]. It is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 

If the respective impedances of the branches of the hybrid that are connected to the conjugate sides of the hybrid are known, hybrid balance may be computed by the formula for [[return loss]].

'''Information assurance''' ('''IA''') is the practice of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, [[non-repudiation]] and confidentiality of user data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosin|first=Artur|date=2018|title=HOW TO INCREASE THE INFORMATION ASSURANCE IN THE INFORMATION AGE|url=http://www.jodrm.eu/issues/volume9_issue1/05_Sosin.pdf|journal=Journal of Defense Resources Management|volume=9|pages=45-57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses physical, technical, and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital, but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to [[data in transit]], both physical and electronic forms, as well as [[data at rest]] in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities. 
Information assurance as a field has grown from the practice of [[information security]].

==Overview==

Information assurance (IA) is the process of getting the right information to the right people at the right time. IA benefits business through the use of information risk management, trust management, resilience, appropriate architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized.&lt;ref name="Bridging the air gap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Christopher|title=Bridging the air gap: an information assurance perspective|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/355926/1/Richardson.pdf|website=ePrints Soton|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=3 November 2015|ref=bridging_air_gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly related to the field of [[information security]], and also with [[business continuity]]. IA relates more to the business level and [[strategy|strategic]] [[risk management]] of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and code (e.g., [[virus]]es), IA practitioners consider [[corporate governance]] issues such as [[privacy]], regulatory and standards [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]], [[audits|auditing]], [[Business continuity planning|business continuity]], and [[disaster recovery]] as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from [[computer science]], IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in [[business]], [[accounting]], user experience, [[fraud]] examination, [[forensic science]], [[management science]], [[systems engineering]], [[security engineering]], and [[criminology]], in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.

Information assurance is also the term used by governments, including the government of the United Kingdom, for the provision of holistic security to information systems.  In this use of the term, the interdisciplinary approach set out above is somewhat lessened in that, while security/ systems engineering, business continuity/ enterprise resilience, forensic investigation and threat analysis is considered, management science, accounting and criminology is not considered in developing mitigation to the risks developed in the risk assessments conducted.  HMG Information Assurance Standard 1&amp;2, which has replaced HMG Information Security Standard 2, sets out the principles and requirements of risk management in accordance with the above principles and is one of the Information Assurance Standards currently used within the UK public sector.

==Process==

The information assurance process typically begins with the enumeration and classification of the information [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a [[risk assessment]] for those assets. Vulnerabilities in the information assets are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually measured in terms of cost to the asset's stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats' impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset.

With the risk assessment complete, the IA practitioner then develops a [[Risk Management Plan|risk management plan]]. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, and response to threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as [[Risk IT]], [[CobiT]], [[PCI DSS]] or [[ISO/IEC 27002]], may guide development. [[Countermeasure (computer)|Countermeasures]] may include technical tools such as [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[anti-virus software]], policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated [[computer emergency response team]] (CERT) or computer security incident response team ([[CSIRT]]).  The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most [[cost-effective]] way.

After the risk management plan is implemented, it is tested and evaluated, often by means of formal audits. The IA process is an iterative one, in that the risk assessment and risk management plan are meant to be periodically revised and improved based on data gathered about their completeness and effectiveness.

== Standards organizations and standards ==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note too the American spellings of '''integrated assessment modeling''' and '''integrated modeling'''.}} is a type of [[scientific modelling]] often used by the [[environmental sciences]] and [[environmental policy]] analysis. The modelling is '''integrated''' because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as '''assessment''' because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated assessment modelling is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical '''models'''.

Integrated assessment modelling has a long history, and scholars disagree on the first precedent. However, it became recognizable as a sub- or inter-discipline in the late 1980s with a focus on understanding and regulating [[acid rain|acidification]]. Integrated assessment modelling was further developed in the area of [[climate change]], inter alias in the context of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]].

Notable centres of integrated assessment modelling are [[IIASA]], [[MIT]], [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]], and [[International Futures]]. Notable scholars are [[Barry B. Hughes]], [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Robert O. Mendelsohn|Robert Mendelsohn]], [[Richard G. Richels|Rich Richels]], [[Michael Schlesinger]], [[Stephen Schneider]], [[Richard Tol]], [[John Weyant]], and [[Gary Yohe]].

== Interpretation ==

While the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) relies heavily on integrated modeling, [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] lead author Thomas Bruckner cautions against overinterpreting the results from such modeling.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-10-26
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to future technology choice, Bruckner observes that "The ''quantitative deployment'' of [[nuclear power]] or [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] technologies that has been found by the IPCC authors in the different mitigation scenarios, for instance, occasionally has been (mis)interpreted as an IPCC ''recommendation for their factual usage''."&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}{{nnbsp}}{{rp|at=emphasis per original}}  Bruckner continues "The scale of deployment of low-carbon technologies shown in [IPCC] diagrams{{nbsp}}... reveals neither the ''possible contribution'' of the respective energy technology to GHG mitigation nor the ''required contribution''.{{nbsp}}... The possible contribution (without considering costs) might be higher whereas the strictly required one could be lower.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

== Criticism ==

Economist [[Robert Pindyck]] argues that IAMs are problematic and "close to useless as tools for policy analysis". He argues that "IAM-based analyses of [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate policy]] create a perception of knowledge and precision that is illusory, and can fool policy-makers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert S. |last1=Pindyck |title=The Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy |journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=100–114 |doi=10.1093/reep/rew012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Fanous''' ({{Lang-cop|ⲓⲥⲁⲁⲕ ⲫⲁⲛⲟⲩⲥ}}; December 19, 1919 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2007) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] artist and scholar, who specialized in [[Coptic art]] and founded its contemporary school.

==Early life and teaching==
Fanous was born in [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] and moved to [[Cairo]] to gain his degree from The Faculty of [[Applied arts]] now part of [[Helwan University]] in Egypt in 1941 and got a diploma in teaching in 1943.
Fanous was one of the first students of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] founded in 1954 and he obtained his doctorate in 1958 . His two-year study grant in the [[Louvre]] in the mid- 1960s was a turning point in his career. He took the opportunity, while in France, to study icon painting under [[Léonid Ouspensky]], under whose patronage he developed a passion both as artist and theologian. This would lead, eventually, to his developing a style that was to become the new face of [[Copts|Coptic]] [[iconography]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm AlAhram weekly article on Isaac Fanous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041300/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elahram.com/Index.asp?CurFN=writ4.htm&amp;DID=9099|title=Elahram.com|website=elahram.com|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanous chaired the Coptic Art department at the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] in [[Cairo]], and he has trained a number of other [[Copt]]ic artists from outside Egypt.

==Political changes==
As wealthy patrons of the arts disappeared from Egypt's hitherto cosmopolitan art world following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], they were replaced by the state, and the career of Fanous took off from the struggles and experiences of his time. That is to say, he became more keenly aware of his Egyptian heritage. He was proud of everything that comes from [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] since the time of [[Akhnaten]], who built his city in this area.&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"&gt;[http://www.copts-united.com/wrr/go1.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1169064300&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=79&amp; Copts United article in Arabic by Shafik Botrous]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Coptic iconography==
For centuries before painters like Isaac Fanous the [[Coptic Orthodox]] church had its own style which is recognised as The Coptic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|website=www.bartleby.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202192654/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|archivedate=2007-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the European art spread to Egypt in the nineteenth Century there are a lot of the Churches in [[Egypt]] which have [[Icon]]s that are similar to a lot of the European (Western) Christianity Iconography style.

Fanous's contemporary school of icon painting came about as part of a general renaissance of Coptic culture which began during the patriarchate of [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]] (1959–1971).&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"/&gt;

He capitalised on the already established Coptic style which could be seen in historic Coptic  Churches, but in his own style which he developed over the years. 

The style of his painting is called Modern Coptic style and as he was a pioneer in this field Fanous is considered the father of modern Coptic icon painting and the initiator of the modern renaissance in [[Coptic art]].&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"/&gt;

Fanous drew all the pictures and icons in [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|St. Takla Haymanot's Church]] in [[Alexandria]], which was consecrated in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://st-takla.org/Church-history-1.html |title=History of Saint Takla Himanout's Church |publisher=Official website of St. Takla Haymanot's Church |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1977 and 1978, he spent six months in the UK to paint icons in [http://www.stmark.org.uk St Mark's Coptic Orthodox church] in  Allen Street, [[Kensington]], London.

The '''Kasepuhan''' or '''Kasepuhan Banten Kidul''' are a traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] community of approximately 5,300 people, who live in the southern part of [[Gunung Halimun National Park]], in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Java]]. Gunung Halimun National Park is located within the borders of the [[Sukabumi Regency]], [[Bogor]] and southern [[Banten]] province. The Kasepuhan is called "Kasepuhan Banten Kidul" (Kasepuhan of Southern Banten), their main village is Ciptagelar in the Cisolok subdistrict (''kecamatan'') in the western part of the [[Sukabumi Regency]]. The current head of the community, Abah Ugih, inherited the position of leader when his father, Abah Anom, died at the age of 54.&lt;ref&gt;J. Adiguna, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 Living in harmony with the nature'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514223326/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 |date=2014-05-14 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''kasepuhan'' is formed on ''sepuh'', which means "old" in the [[Sundanese language]]. It refers to a way of living based on ancestral traditions and eventually, to the local community who lives according to these traditions.

==History and tradition==
According to oral information, the Kasepuhan have lived in this area (''Banten Kidul'', or ''south Banten'') since 1368.   The ancestors of the Kasepuhan are said to have lived in the area of Bogor, east of Gunung Halimun. At that time, their ancestors were part of a kingdom that encompassed the province of West Java and Banten.

The people of the Kasepuhan claim they are linked with the [[Baduy people|Baduy]], another traditional group in West Java. The main belief system of Kasepuhan people is [[Sunda Wiwitan]]. Nowadays, the Kasepuhan are influenced by [[Islam]].  However they do not strictly follow all rules of Islam but, rather, combine their beliefs with [[animism]] and [[Sundanese (people)|Sundanese]] traditions. Just as their ancestors, they have combined several traditions and religions with their own Kasepuhan tradition; that is, they are influenced by Islam, Sundanese traditions, Pajajaran traditions and thus Hinduism and also animism.

The main ritual of Kasepuhan community is ''[[Seren Taun]]'', or rice harvest thanksgiving as well as marking the new agriculture year in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] tradition. Seren Taun festival also celebrated by other Sundanese traditional communities in other areas such as Sundanese community in Cigugur [[Kuningan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2011/01/23/09340353/Hari.Ini.Puncak.Seren.Taun.di.Bogor Seren Taun Bogor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kasepuhan history existed since 1368 (note: the years allowed to write down) their believe before that time also they still have story, but enough to lets other peoples known only from that time.
the areas of the kingdom called " Banten Kidul" its a territories  before the government age, and now this Banten Kidul area on three sub district areas ( Lebak, Bogor and Sukabumi)
The peoples in Kasepuhan still living in the tradition and ancient cultures role of custom, following what the ancestor said for their life and living on rice plantation. the rice they have to plan is only rice seed from the ancestor ( data 2014: there are 167 original varieties) planting till today, and more than 300 new varieties from natural mixing on the rice field.

By far the most important way of subsistence for the Kasepuhan is agriculture, which can split into two categories: ' Huma'' (Dry rice cultivation), ''Sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). the Dry system rice plantation is the original way plantation from the ancestor, and since the Dutch time then they have wets system rice plantation called "Sawah".

About 85% of Kasepuhan agricultural land is ''sawah'', 10% consists of ''ladang'', and 5% ''kebun''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">In the [[philosophy of science]], under the [[correspondence principle]], a '''limiting case''' [[theory]] is an earlier theory which becomes incorporated into a later, usually broader theory; that is to say, the earlier (limiting case) theory proves to be a special or limited case of the later theory. Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that [[classical mechanics]] constitutes a low-energy limiting case of [[relativity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivadulla, Andres: [https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/481-2013-10-14-TheNewtonianLimit.pdf The Newtonian Limit of Relativity Theory and the Rationality of Theory Change], Synthese 141:417–429, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, James (2013): "Toward a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience", in ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience'', Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In words of [[Larry Laudan]], [[scientific realism|realist]] philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be a limiting case of [the theory] T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only if (a) ''all'' the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are assigned a value by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as, or very close to, the values T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions—consistent with T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—are specified".

The idea that a theory (in our previous example, [[Newtonian mechanics]]) that is close to being true (i.e., that is [[verisimil]]) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, [[relativistic mechanics]]) can be an argument for [[scientific realism]], as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.

A '''Bible dictionary''' is a reference work containing encyclopedic entries related to the [[Bible]], typically concerning people, places, customs, doctrine and [[Biblical criticism]]. Bible dictionaries can be scholarly or popular in tone.

The first dictionary of the Bible in English was the ''Christian Dictionarie'' (1612) of [[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=29689|title=Wilson, Thomas|first=Stephen|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marsh funnel''' is a simple device for measuring [[viscosity]] by observing the time it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from a cone through a short tube.  It is standardized for use by [[mud engineer]]s to check the quality of [[drilling mud]].  Other cones with different geometries and orifice arrangements are called ''flow cones'', but have the same operating principle.

In use, the funnel is held vertically with the end of the tube closed by a finger.  The liquid to be measured is poured through the mesh to remove any particles which might block the tube.  When the fluid level reaches the mesh, the amount inside is equal to the rated volume.  To take the measurement, the finger is released as a stopclock is started, and the liquid is allowed to run into a measuring container.  The time in seconds is recorded as a measure of the viscosity.

==The Marsh Funnel==
Based on a method published in 1931 by H.N.Marsh,&lt;ref name=Marsh1931&gt;H. N. Marsh (1931)''Trans AIME'' vol 92 pp 234-251 "Properties and Treatment of Rotary Mud"&lt;/ref&gt; a Marsh cone is a flow cone with an [[aspect ratio]] of 2:1 and a working volume of at least a litre.  A Marsh funnel is a Marsh cone with a particular orifice and a working volume of 1.5 litres.  It consists of a cone 6 inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) across and 12 inches in height (305&amp;nbsp;mm) to the apex of which is fixed a tube 2 inches (50.8&amp;nbsp;mm) long and 3/16 inch (4.76&amp;nbsp;mm) internal diameter.  A 10-mesh screen is fixed near the top across half the cone.&lt;ref name=API13B&gt;{{Citation |title=13B-1 Recommended Standard Procedure for Field Testing Water-Based Drilling Fluids |year=1990 | publication-place=Dallas |publisher=American Petroleum Institute |url=http://www.pngis.net/standards/6400/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American practice (and most of the [[oil industry]]) the volume collected is a quart.  If water is used, the time should be 26 +/- 0.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=API13B/&gt; If the time is less than this the tube is probably enlarged by erosion, if more it may be blocked or damaged, and the funnel should be replaced.  In some companies, and Europe in particular, the volume collected is a litre, for which the water funnel time should be 28 seconds.  Marsh himself collected 0.50 litre, for which the time was 18.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Marsh1931/&gt;

The Marsh funnel time is often referred to as the Marsh funnel viscosity, and represented by the abbreviation FV.  The unit (seconds) is often omitted.  Formally, the volume should also be stated.
The (quart) Marsh funnel time for typical drilling muds is 34 to 50 seconds, though mud mixtures to cope with some geological conditions may have a time of 100 or more seconds.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. McCray &amp; F. W. Cole (1979) ''Oil Well Drilling Technology'' University of Oklahoma Press {{ISBN|0-8061-0423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the most common use is for [[drilling mud]]s, which are [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, the Marsh funnel is not a [[rheometer]], because it only provides one measurement under one flow condition.  However the effective viscosity can be determined from following simple formula.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;M. J. Pitt (2000) ''SPE Drilling and Completion'' vol 15 no1  pages 3-6 “The Marsh Funnel and Drilling Fluid Viscosity: A New Equation for Field Use”&lt;/ref&gt;

μ = ρ (t - 25)

where μ = effective viscosity in [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]]&lt;br /&gt; ρ = density in g/cm³&lt;br /&gt;t = quart funnel time in seconds

For example, a mud of funnel time 40 seconds and density 1.1 g/cm³ has an effective viscosity of about 16.5 cP.  For the range of times of typical muds above, the [[shear rate]] in the Marsh funnel is about 2000 &lt;sup&gt;−s&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Other Flow Cones==
The term '''Marsh cone''' is also used in the [[concrete]] and [[oil industry|oil industries]].  European standard EN445&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BS EN445:1997 Grout for prestressing tendons - test methods |publisher=British Standards Institute |year=1997 |url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/SearchResults/?q=EN+445&amp;ib=1&amp;snc=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and American standard C939&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=ASTM C939-10 Standard Test Method for Flow of Grout |publisher=ASTM International |year=2010 |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/C939.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for measuring the flow properties of [[cement]] [[grout]] mixtures specify a funnel similar to the Marsh cone.  Some manufacturers supply devices which they call Marsh cones, with removable tubes with size ranges from 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;mm.  These can be used for quality control by selecting a tube which gives a convenient time, say 30 to 60 seconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Mesosociology''' is the study of intermediate (''meso'') social forces and [[social stratification|stratification]] such as [[income]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[social organization|organization]]s and geographically circumscribed [[community|communities]]. 

Mesosociology lies between analysis of large-scale macro forces such as the [[economy]] or human [[society|societies]] (which is a domain of [[macrosociology]]), and everyday human [[social interaction]]s on a small scale (a domain of [[microsociology]]).

==Social control==
Meso-level forces of [[social control]] include organizations and communities. The organizations are middle level structures of control. One type is a total institution, which is an organization in which people are confined until they can adhere to society's norms, including prisons and mental hospitals. Another type of middle level organization is the reintegration structure. This structure rehabilitates those who do not conform. These include rehabilitation centers for drugs and alcohol. A final type of organization is a [[safety-valve organization]]. These provide outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, including prostitution. Communities also are instruments of social control. Things that are controlled by local governments are often the most visible signs of social control in a community, such as a police force and the organization of neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

'''Nyctinasty''' is the circadian rhythmic [[nastic]] movement of higher plants in response to the onset of darkness, or a plant "sleeping". Examples are the closing of the [[petal]]s of a flower at dusk and the sleep movements of the leaves of many [[legume]]s. The earliest recorded observation of this behavior in plants dates back to 324 BC when Androsthenes, a companion to Alexander the Great, noted the opening and closing of tamarind tree leaves from day to night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otsuka|first1=Kuniaki|title=Chronomics and Continuous Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring: Vascular Chronomics: From 7-Day/24-Hour to Lifelong Monitoring|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4431546306|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyctinastic movements are associated with diurnal light and temperature changes and controlled by the [[circadian clock]] and the light receptor [[phytochrome]]. This is the plant sleeping. Plants use phytochrome to detect red and far red light. Depending on which kind of light is absorbed, the protein can switch between a Pr state that absorbs red light and a Pfr state that absorbs far red light. Red light converts Pr to Pfr and far red light converts Pfr to Pr. Many plants use [[phytochrome]] to establish circadian cycles which influence the opening and closing of leaves associated with nyctastic movements. Anatomically, the movements are mediated by [[pulvinus|pulvini]]. Pulvinus cells are located at the base or apex of the petiole and the flux of water from the dorsal to ventral motor cells regulates leaf closure. This flux is in response to movement of potassium ions between pulvinus and surrounding tissue. Movement of potassium ions is connected to the concentration of Pfr or Pr. In ''[[Albizia julibrissin]]'', longer darker periods, leading to low Pfr, result in a faster leaf opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Satter|first1=R. L.|last2=Applewhite|first2=P. B.|last3=Galston|first3=A. W.|title=Phytochrome-controlled Nyctinasty in Albizzia julibrissin: V. Evidence against Acetylcholine Participation|journal=Plant Physiology|date=1 October 1972|volume=50|issue=4|pages=523–525|doi=10.1104/pp.50.4.523|pmc=366182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the SLEEPLESS mutation of ''[[Lotus japonicus]]'', the pulvini are changed into [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]-like structures, rendering the plant incapable of closing its leaflets at night.&lt;ref name="Kawaguchi"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Kawaguchi M | title = SLEEPLESS, a gene conferring nyctinastic movement in legume | journal = J. Plant Res. | date = 2003 | volume = 116 | pages = 151–154 | pmid = 12736786 | doi = 10.1007/s10265-003-0079-5|issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaf movement is also controlled by bioactive substances known as leaf opening or leaf closing factors. Several leaf-opening and leaf-closing factors have been characterized biochemically.&lt;ref name="Ueda"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Ueda M, Nakamura Y | title = Chemical basis of plant leaf movement | journal = Plant Cell Physiol. | date = 2007 | volume = 48 | pages = 900–907 | pmid = 17566057 | doi = 10.1093/pcp/pcm060|issue= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors differ among plants. Leaf closure and opening is mediated by the relative concentrations of leaf opening and closing factors in a plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohnuki|first1=Takashi|last2=Ueda|first2=Minoru|last3=Yamamura|first3=Shosuke|title=Molecular mechanism of the control of nyctinastic leaf-movement in Lespedeza cuneata G.

In ''[[Lespedeza cuneata]]'' the leaf opening factor, potassium lespedezate, is hydrolyzed to 4 hydroxy phenyl pyruvic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ueda|first1=Minoru|last2=Yamamura|first2=Shosuke|title=Chemistry and Biology of Plant Leaf Movements|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=17 April 2000|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1400–1414|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(20000417)39:8&lt;1400::AID-ANIE1400&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Phyllanthus urinaria]]'', leaf closing factor Phyllanthurinolactone is hydrolyzed to its aglycon during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ueda|first1=Minoru|last2=Asano|first2=Miho|last3=Sawai|first3=Yoshiyuki|last4=Yamamura|first4=Shosuke|title=Leaf-movement factors of nyctinastic plant, Phyllanthus urinaria L.; the universal mechanism for the regulation of nyctinastic leaf-movement|journal=Tetrahedron|date=April 1999|volume=55|issue=18|pages=5781–5792|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(99)00236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta glucosidase activity is regulated via circadian rhythms.

Fluorescence studies have shown that the binding sites of leaf opening and closing factors are located on the surface of the motor cell. Shrinking and expansion of the motor cell in response to this chemical signal allows for leaf opening and closure. The binding of leaf opening and closing factors is specific to related plants. The leaf movement factor of ''Chamaecrista mimosoides'' (formerly ''Cassia mimosoides'') was found to not bind to the motor cell of ''[[Albizia julibrissin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugimoto|first1=Takanori|last2=Wada|first2=Yoko|last3=Yamamura|first3=Shosuke|last4=Ueda|first4=Minoru|title=Fluorescence study on the nyctinasty of Cassia mimosoides L. using novel fluorescence-labeled probe compounds|journal=Tetrahedron|date=December 2001|volume=57|issue=49|pages=9817–9825|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)00999-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaf movement factor of ''Albizia julibrissin'' similarly didn’t bind to the motor cell of ''Chamaecrista mimosoides'', but did bind to ''[[Albizia saman]]'' and ''[[Albizia lebbeck]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lattanzio|first1=Vincenzo|last2=Escribano-Bailon|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Santos-Buelga|first3=Celestino|title=Recent advances in polyphenol research.|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1405193993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of, and conferred benefits of nyctinastic movement have yet to be identified. Studies using mutant plants with a loss of function gene that results in petiole growth instead of pulvini found that these plants has less biomass and smaller leaf area  than the wild type. This indicates nyctnastic movement may be beneficial toward plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Chuanen|last2=Han|first2=Lu|last3=Fu|first3=Chunxiang|last4=Chai|first4=Maofeng|last5=Zhang|first5=Wenzheng|last6=Li|first6=Guifen|last7=Tang|first7=Yuhong|last8=Wang|first8=Zeng-Yu|title=Identification and characterization of petiolule- like pulvinus mutants with abolished nyctinastic leaf movement in the model legume Medicago truncatula|journal=New Phytologist|date=October 2012|volume=196|issue=1|pages=92–100|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04268.x|pmid=22891817|pmc=3504090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oragenitalism''''' is a book by the American folklorist [[Gershon Legman]], published by the Julian Press in 1969. The book describes various types of [[oral sex]]. 
The book is intended as "instruction manual, conduct guide, and household advice book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7OeNRe9V1K8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq= Kick 2006, p. 66a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author claimed that it was the earliest book of its kind on the subject, and for a long time the only one.&lt;ref name=brottman31&gt;Brottman (2004) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its contents are divided into four sections: "[[Cunnilingus|Cunnilinctus]]" written under the pen-name Roger-Maxe de la Glannege (an [[anagram]] of his real name) and published by Jacob Brussel of New York in 1940;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Martha Cornog |author2=Timothy Perper | title=Make love, not war: The legacy of Gershon Legman, 1917-1999 | doi=10.1080/00224499909552002 | journal=Journal of Sex Research | volume=36 | issue=3 |date=August 1999 | pages=316–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade (2001) p.802&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining sections "[[Fellatio]]", "[[Irrumatio]]n", and "[[69 (sex position)|Sixty-Nine]]" were not published until 1969.&lt;ref name=brottman31/&gt;

== Galactic astronomy ==

In [[galactic astronomy]], '''peculiar motion''' refers to the motion of an object (usually a [[star]]) relative to a Galactic rest frame.

Local objects are often related in terms of [[proper motion]] and [[radial velocity]], which can be combined through [[Vector (spatial)|vector addition]] to produce the object's motion relative to the [[Sun]]. Velocities for local objects are sometimes reported with respect to the [[local standard of rest]] (LSR) — the average local motion of material in the galaxy — instead of the Sun's rest frame. Translating between the LSR and heliocentric rest frames requires the calculation of the Sun's peculiar velocity in the LSR.&lt;ref name=mnras403&gt;

== Cosmology ==

In [[physical cosmology]], '''peculiar velocity''' refers to the components of a [[galaxy]]'s velocity that deviate from the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]]. According to Hubble's Law, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance from us.

Galaxies are not distributed evenly throughout observable space, but are typically found in groups or [[galaxy cluster|clusters]], where they have a significant [[gravitation|gravitational]] effect on each other. [[velocity dispersion|Velocity dispersions]] of galaxies arising from this gravitational attraction are usually in the hundreds of kilometers per second, but they can rise to over 1000 km/s in rich clusters.&lt;ref name=Girardi93&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This velocity can alter the [[recessional velocity]] that  would be expected from the Hubble flow and effect the observed [[redshift]] of objects via the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. The Doppler redshift due to peculiar velocities is
:&lt;math&gt;1+z_{pec}=\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;z \approx v/c &lt;/math&gt;

for low velocities (small redshifts). This combines with the redshift from the Hubble flow to give the observed redshift&lt;ref name=Davis11/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1+z_{obs} = (1+z_{pec})(1+z_{H}).&lt;/math&gt;

The radial velocity of an object can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;v_{r} = H_0 d + v_{pec}&lt;/math&gt;

with contributions from both the Hubble flow and peculiar velocity terms, where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble constant and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the object.

[[Redshift-space distortions]] can cause the spacial distributions of cosmological objects to appear elongated or flattened out, depending on the cause of the peculiar velocities.&lt;ref name=Kaiser87&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elongation, sometimes referred to as the "Fingers of God" effect, is caused by random thermal motion of objects; however, correlated peculiar velocities from gravitational infall are the cause of a flattening effect.&lt;ref name=Percival11&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main consequence is that, in determining the distance of a single galaxy, a possible error must be assumed.  This error becomes smaller as distance increases. For example, in surveys of type Ia [[supernova|supernovae]], peculiar velocities have a significant influence on measurements out to redshifts around 0.5, leading to errors of several percent when calculating cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name=Davis11&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9083">'''Population momentum''' is a typical consequence of the demographic transition.  Even if a high-fertility, high-growth population experiences an immediate drop in fertility to [[replacement rate]], that population will continue to grow for several decades.  Eventually, because the new fertility rate is replacement, the population achieves equilibrium at some new level.  Population momentum is defined as the ratio of the size of the population at that new equilibrium level to the size of the initial population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Population momentum usually occurs in populations that are growing.

== Example ==

Assume that a population has three generations: First (oldest), Second (child bearing), and Third (children).  Further assume that this population has a fertility rate equal to four (4).  That is, each generation is twice the size of the previous.  If the population of the first generation is arbitrarily set at 100, the second is then 200, and the third is 400.  The spreadsheet below shows the initial population in the first row.

|}

First note that the second and third generation of the initial population are each twice the size of the previous.  The total of the initial population is 700 = 100 + 200 + 400.

Then assume that at the end of the third generation, fertility falls to replacement (for simplicity assume that to be two). Now take the population forward in time to the next generation, line two of the spreadsheet. The first generation dies, and the new generation, the fourth, is equal to the third (because now fertility is replacement).  Repeat the process again to reach the fifth generation (line 3 in the spreadsheet). The fifth generation is again equal to the fourth and now the population’s three generations are equal, and the population has reached equilibrium.

The initial population has grown from 700 to 1,200 even though fertility dropped from four to replacement (two) at the end of the third generation.  Population momentum carried the population to higher levels over the next two generations.

== Further steps to zero population growth ==

Population momentum impacts the immediate birth and [[death rates]] in the population that determine the natural rate of growth. However, for the a population to have an absolute zero amount of natural growth, the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health suggests that three things must occur.

1. Fertility rates must level off to the [[replacement rate]] (the [[net reproduction rate]] should be 1). If the fertility rate remains higher than the replacement rate, the population would continue to grow.

2. [[Mortality rate]] must stop declining, that is, it must remain constant.

3. Lastly, the age structure must adjust to the new rates of fertility and mortality. This last step takes the longest to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bongaarts|first=John|date=|year=2009|title=Human population growth and the demographic transition|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=364|issue=1532|pages=2985–2990|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0137|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2781829|pmid=19770150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of Population Momentum ==
Population momentum has implications for population policy for a number of reasons.

1. With respect to high-fertility countries (for example in the [[developing world]]), a positive population momentum, meaning that the population is increasing, states that these countries will continue to grow despite large and rapid declines in fertility.

2. With respect to [[Total fertility rate|lowest-low fertility]] countries (for example in [[Europe]]), a negative population momentum implies that these countries may experience population decline even if they try to increase their rate of fertility to the replacement rate of 2.1. For example, some [[Eastern European]] countries show a population shrinkage even if their birth rates recovered to replacement level. Population momentum can become negative if the fertility rate is under replacement level for a long period of time.

3. Population momentum shows that replacement level fertility is a long-term concept rather than an indication of current population growth rates. Depending on the extant age structure, a fertility rate of two children per woman may correspond to short-term growth or decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/Files/PopFacts_2017-4_Population-Momentum.pdf|title=The impact of population momentum on future population growth|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=United Nations Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Another implication of population momentum is its effect on the labor force; more specifically the distribution of the labor force[1]. We established earlier that population momentum occurs when a population continues to grow despite the replacement fertility level being met. Meaning that there are more children being born. When there are more children being birthed for that time being until the child is able to work they become dependents meaning that they don't do much to "contribute" to their society. Which leads to an unfavorabale dependency ratio. When the children reach the age to work that countries dependency ratio will change and become favorable.

==Calculation==
[[File:Population pyramid of India 2015.png|thumb|[[Demographics of India|Population pyramid of India]] showing the beginning of  population momentum even though their birth rates have been declining since 1955]]
To calculate population momentum for population A, a theoretical population is constructed in which the [[birth rate]] for population A immediately becomes replacement level. Under such conditions, the population will eventually stabilize into a stationary population, with no year-to-year changes in age-specific rates or in total population. The population momentum is calculated by dividing this final total population number by the starting population.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Heuveline, and Guillot (2001) Demography: Measuring and Modeling Population Processes, 165&lt;/ref&gt; Momentum, Ω, can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\Omega=(be_o)Q&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''b'' is the crude birth rate while ''e&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the life expectancy at birth. ''Q'' is the total number of births per initial birth.

&lt;math&gt;Q={1 \over r\mu}{R_o -1\over R_o}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is used to derive Q (total births per initial birth), ''r'' is the growth rate and ''µ'' is the unchanging population mean age at childbearing. R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the Net Reproduction Rate of the non-changing population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young J.|last2=Schoen|first2=Robert|date=1997-08-01|title=Population momentum expresses population aging|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/3038294|journal=Demography|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=421–427|doi=10.2307/3038294|issn=0070-3370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Population momentum is typically caused by a shift in the country's [[demographic transition]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blue|first=Laura|last2=Espenshade|first2=Thomas J.|date=|year=2011|title=Population Momentum Across the Demographic Transition|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=721–747|issn=0098-7921|pmc=3345894|pmid=22319771|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[mortality rate]]s drop, the young survive childhood and the aging population live longer.

Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space. Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers, the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle-free shopping experience for the consumer.
For example, research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A.

Retail spaces, especially when they form part of a [[retail chain]], must also be designed to draw people into the space to shop. The storefront must act as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for the store, often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside. In the case of a retail chain, the individual spaces must be unified in their design.&lt;ref name="Luxury" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R8N6qJeo1DAC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHuRTKiHF8K78ga1v5i-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Boutiques and other retail spaces: the architecture of seduction"] by Leontine de Wit, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century, with stores such as [[Bon Marche]] and [[Printemps]] in [[Paris]], "followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago, Selfridges in London and Macy's in New York." These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the [[chain store]]. 

The first known [[chain stores|chain department stores]] were established in Belgium in 1875, when Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated ''Dewachter frères'' (Dewachter Brothers) selling [[ready-to-wear]] clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear.&lt;ref name =ACTS&gt;Annexes to the Belgian Monitor of 1875. Acts, Extracts of Acts, Minutes and Documents relating to Corporations, Book #3, Page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm opened with four locations&lt;ref name =ACTS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:La Louvière|The French Wikipedia site reports that ''Dewachter frères'' opened in La Louvière in 1865, but provides no reference.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1904, ''Maison Dewachter'' (House of Dewachter) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with multiple stores in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Maison Dewachter'' Liège 1891 letterhead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maison_Dewachter_Bordeaux,_France_Letterhead_1904.png ''Maison Dewachter'' Bordeaux 1904 letterhead listing 20 cities and towns and three stores in Bordeaux itself]&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore's eldest son, Louis Dewachter, managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym [[Louis Dewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], which quickly became a franchise across the US. Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later, with stores like [[Boots UK|Boots]]. After [[World War II]], a new type of retail design building known as the [[shopping centre]] came into being. This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe. Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the [[suburban]] family, while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town. The first shopping centre in the [[Netherlands]] was built in the 1950s, as retail design ideas began spreading east.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPROj1JJIO4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Retail Design"], ''Design: the key concepts'' by Catherine McDermott, Psychology Press, 2007, Pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the [[boutique]] in the 1960s, which emphasized retail design run by individuals. Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the [[Biba]] boutique created by [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and the [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]] line of stores made by [[Terence Conran]]. The rise of the boutique was followed, in the next two decades, with an overall increase in consumer spending across the [[Developed country|developed world]]. This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses. Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes. These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple "expensive, one-off designer shops" catering to specific [[fashion design]]ers and retailers.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

The rise of the [[internet]] and [[Online shopping|internet retailing]] in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate. Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops, where retail design can be properly utilized.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

==Usage==

===Role===
A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the [[consumer]], by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.9&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity. Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design elements===
Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear, a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined. These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space, entrances, circulation systems, atmospheric qualities (light and sound) and materiality. By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise. It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features, that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change (e.g. per season).&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design; often the spaces already exist, and have had many prior uses. It is at this stage that logistics must be determined, structural features like columns, stairways, ceiling height, windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design. In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.15-17&lt;/ref&gt; The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space. [[circulation (architecture)|Circulation]] is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back, guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience:

# '''Straight plan:''' this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise. It also leads the consumer to the back of the store. This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Pathway plan:''' is most suitable for large stores that are single level. In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures, this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store. This is well suited for apparel department stores, as the clothes will be easily accessible.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Diagonal plan:''' uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow. The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible. This plan is most suited for self-service retail.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Curved plan:''' aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting. In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls, corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures. Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Varied plan:''' in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas, as well as having storage areas that line the wall. This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;
# '''Geometric plan:''' uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement. By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces. This is well suited for appeal stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;

Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined, the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting, sound, materials and visual branding. These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space. It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store. The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures. Firstly, examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space. Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.65-80&lt;/ref&gt; If no natural light exists, a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space. The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider. This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas. The next layer should emphasize the selling areas. These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh. Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer. To minimize the possibility of eye strain, the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas. The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer. The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.147-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.183-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio, the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to, this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed. In a lingerie store the music should be soft, feminine and romanticized; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd.p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Materiality (architecture)|Materiality]] is another key selling tool, the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.563-566&lt;/ref&gt; Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable. The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting, a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p51-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.160-172&lt;/ref&gt; By switching materials throughout the store zones/ areas can be defined, for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store. Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise. As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"/&gt;

Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return. The key factor is consistency exterior [[brand]]ing and signage should continue into the interior, they should attract, stimulate and dramatise the store. To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store, proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located. The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.81-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective===
The final element of a well-executed retail space is the staging of the consumer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space. From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SIT Graduate Institute''' (formally, the '''School for International Training''') is an accredited institution of higher education administered by [[World Learning]], a [[non-profit]] [[international development]] and [[education]] organization. The Graduate Institute offers [[master's degree]]s and graduate certificates in a variety of fields related to [[international education]] and [[sustainable development]]. Located in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], the school also maintains a branch campus in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
The School for International Training (SIT) was established in 1964.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://graduate.sit.edu/sit-graduate-institute/sn/about-sit/history-and-mission/ SIT Graduate Institute, "History".] Accessed: Feb 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT filled a need of returned [[Peace Corps]] volunteers by offering a graduate degree in international development. The Vermont campus originally consisted of a small collection of dorms around a Carriage House on a scenic farm on the north end of Brattleboro. These early Peace Corps volunteers took lessons in foreign languages with materials and teachers from the language training from their service, and The School for International Training began to expand its offerings. By 1968, the small but increasing number of returned Peace Corps volunteers were requesting a degree in Teaching English as a Second Language, a new specialty. In 1969, two graduate programs were developed, International Career Training (ICT), and Masters in Teaching Languages (MAT) ([[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[ESL]]). An undergraduate program, the World Issues Program (WIP), was developed in 1973 and resulted in 26 graduating classes. The WIP program was based on an experiential learning model. Students received their BA in International or Community Development, and International Studies. The last WIP class graduated in 1999.

The first MAT class consisted of three students, the second of 28 students, and the third of 38; in the fourth year the class size reached 50 students and stayed there for many years. ICTs spent part of their program on campus and part in internships around the world. MATs originally went to [[Mexico]] or [[Quebec]] for student teaching but by 1972, students began to develop other sites around the world. Eventually, the ICT program changed to PIM: Programs in Intercultural Management and developed specializations in NGS's and Civil Society, Peace and Conflict Transformation, Social Justice, Socially Responsible Management, Sustainable Development, International Education, Language and Culture, Teacher Preparation. [[Jody Williams]], an MAT graduate, won the [[Nobel Prize]] for her work on banning [[land mine]]s. [[Wangari Maathai]], former Trustee Emerita, won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her work on sustainable development and [[democracy]] in [[Kenya]].

In the late 1990s the MAT department created the Teacher Knowledge Project as a way for teachers to work together using the reflective cycle (to inquire into their practice) and principles of Experiential Learning. This project resulted in research in schools in [[New England]] focusing on [[reflective teaching]], [[mentoring]] and structured [[language immersion]]. Other offshoots of the MAT program include a four-week [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] Certificate program that offers basic preparation for teaching English as a second or foreign language and the ACCESS program that helps content teachers develop skills for working with English language learners in their classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sit.edu/graduate/6882.htm SIT Graduate Institute, "TESOL Overview"] Accessed: May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the School for International Training hosted and worked with [[North American Summer Esperanto Institute|Nord-Amerika Somera Kursaro]] (NASK), [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], OTEP, [[USAID]] and other international groups through the World Learning network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">For [[power semiconductor device]]s (such as [[BJT]], [[MOSFET]], [[thyristor]] or [[IGBT]]), the '''safe operating area''' (SOA) is defined as the [[voltage]] and [[current (electricity)|current]] conditions over which the device can be expected to operate without self-damage.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Williams ,''The circuit designer's companion 2nd ed.'',Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7506-6370-7}},  pp.129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

SOA is usually presented in transistor [[datasheet]]s as a graph with V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; (collector-emitter voltage) on the [[abscissa]] and I&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; (collector-emitter current) on the [[ordinate]]; the safe 'area' referring to the area under the curve. The SOA specification combines the various limitations of the device — maximum voltage, current, power, [[junction temperature]], secondary breakdown — into one curve, allowing simplified design of protection circuitry.
[[File:BDV66C limits.png|thumb|right|Illustration of safe operating area of a bipolar power transistor. Any combination of collector current and voltage below the line can be tolerated by the transistor.]]

Often, in addition to the continuous rating, separate SOA curves are plotted for short duration pulse conditions (1 ms pulse, 10 ms pulse, etc.).

The safe operating area curve is a graphical representation of the power handling capability of the device under various conditions. The SOA curve takes into account the wire bond current carrying capability, transistor junction temperature, internal power dissipation and secondary breakdown limitations.

==Limits of the safe operating area==
Where both current and voltage are plotted on [[logarithmic scale]]s, the borders of the SOA are straight lines:
# I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; =  I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;max — current limit
# V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;max — voltage limit
# I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = Pmax — dissipation limit, thermal breakdown
# I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = const — this is the limit given by the secondary breakdown (bipolar junction transistors only)

SOA specifications are useful to the design engineer working on power circuits such as [[amplifier]]s and [[power supply|power supplies]] as they allow quick assessment of the limits of device performance, the design of appropriate protection circuitry, or selection of a more capable device. SOA curves are also important in the design of [[Foldback (power supply design)|foldback]] circuits.

==Secondary breakdown==
''For a device that makes use of the secondary breakdown effect see [[Avalanche transistor]]''

'''Secondary breakdown''' is a failure mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads to the destruction of the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with forward and reverse base drive.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner,(ed), ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 {{ISBN|0408001682}}, pages 8-45 and 8-46&lt;/ref&gt; Except at low collector-emitter voltages, the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://semicon.sanyo.com/en/reliability/main.php?id=M30A139&amp;part=6 SANYO Semiconductor Co., Ltd., ''Area of Safe Operation'']&lt;/ref&gt; Older power MOSFETs did not exhibit secondary breakdown, with their safe operating area being limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the bonding wires), maximum power dissipation and maximum voltage. This has changed in more recent devices as detailed in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Horowitz]] and Winfield Hill, ''The Art of Electronics 2nd Ed. '' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989 {{ISBN|0-521-37095-7}} page 321&lt;/ref&gt;  However, power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling secondary breakdown.

==MOSFET thermal runaway in linear mode==
In their early history, MOSFETs became known for their absence of secondary breakdown. This benefit was due to the fact that ON-resistance increases with increasing temperature, so that part of the MOSFET which is running hotter (e.g. due to irregularities in the die-attachment, etc.) will carry a lower current density, tending to even out any temperature variation and prevent hot spots. Recently, MOSFETs with very high transconductance, optimised for switching operation, have become available. When operated in linear mode, especially at high drain-source voltages and low drain currents, the gate-source voltage tends to be very close to the threshold voltage. Unfortunately the threshold voltage decreases as temperature increases, so that if there are any slight temperature variations across the chip, then the hotter regions will tend to carry more current than the cooler regions when Vgs is very close to Vth. This can lead to thermal runaway and the destruction of the MOSFET even when it is operating within its Vds, Id and Pd ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irf.com/technical-info/appnotes/an-1155.pdf International Rectifier Application Note AN-1155]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN11158.pdf NXP AN11158]&lt;/ref&gt; Some (usually expensive) MOSFETs are specified for operation in the linear region and include DC SOA diagrams, e.g. IXYS IXTK8N150L.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/de.sci.electronics/ioET2qtOj9Q Discussion of MOSFET SOA (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse bias safe operating area==
Transistors require some time to turn off, due to effects such as minority carrier storage time and capacitance. While turning off, they may be damaged depending on how the load responds (especially with poorly [[snubber|snubbed]] inductive loads). The '''reverse bias safe operating area''' (or '''RBSOA''') is the SOA during the brief time before turning the device into the off state—during the short time when the base current bias is reversed. As long as the collector voltage and collector current stay within the RBSOA during the entire turnoff, the transistor will be undamaged. Typically the RBSOA will be specified for a variety of turn-off conditions, such as shorting the base to the emitter, but also faster turn-off protocols where the base-emitter voltage bias is reversed.

The RBSOA shows distinct dependencies compared to the normal SOA. For example in [[IGBT]]s the high-current, high-voltage corner of the RBSOA is cut out when the collector voltage increases too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Rashid ,'' Power electronics handbook'', Academic Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-12-581650-2}}, pp 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; Since the RBSOA is associated with a very brief turn-off process, it is not constrained by the continuous power dissipation limit.

The ordinary safe operating area (when the device is in the on state) may be referred to as the '''Forward bias safe operating area''' (or '''FBSOA''') when it is possible to confuse it with the RBSOA.

==Protection==
The most common form of SOA protection used with bipolar junction transistors senses the collector-emitter current with a low-value series resistor; the voltage across this resistor is applied to a small auxiliary transistor that progressively 'steals' base current from the power device as it passes excess collector current.

Another style of protection is to measure the temperature of the outside of the transistor, as an estimate of junction temperature, and reduce drive to the device or switch it off if the temperature is too high. If multiple transistors are used in parallel, only a few need to be monitored for case temperature to protect all parallel devices. 


This approach is effective but not bullet-proof. In practice it is very difficult to design a protection circuit that will work under all conditions, and it is left up to the design engineer to weigh the likely fault conditions against the complexity and cost of the protection.

[[File:ARV Midwest.pdf|thumb|ARV Super2 with semi-monocoque fuselage]]
The term '''semi-monocoque''' refers to a stressed shell structure that is similar to a true [[monocoque]], but which derives at least some of its strength from conventional reinforcement.  Semi-monocoque construction is used for, among other things, aircraft fuselages, car bodies and motorcycle frames.

==Examples of semi-monocoque vehicles==

Semi-monocoque aircraft fuselages differ from true [[monocoque]] construction through being reinforced with longitudinal stringers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semimonocoque&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aviationchatter.com/2010/01/semi-monocoque-mono-what/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305223440/http://www.aviationchatter.com/2010/01/semi-monocoque-mono-what/ |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mooney Aviation Company|Mooney]] range of four seat aircraft, for instance, use a steel tube truss frame around the passenger compartment with monocoque behind.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The British [[ARV Super2]] light aircraft has a fuselage constructed mainly of [[aluminium]] alloy, but with some [[fibreglass]] elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9920">The '''semiotics of dress''' is a term used to refer to the [[fashion design|design]] and customs associated with [[dress]] ([[clothing]]), as patterned to a kind of [[symbol]]ism that has rules and norms.

The term "[[semiotics]]" can be defined as a system of linguistic signs or symbols.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owyong|first=Yuet See Monica|date=2009-06-01|title=Clothing semiotics and the social construction of power relations|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10350330902816434|journal=Social Semiotics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=192|doi=10.1080/10350330902816434|issn=1035-0330}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of signs or symbols is not limited to language only. Therefore, the term '''semiotics of dress''' can be further referred to as a non-linguistic semiotic resource which interrelates with [[facial expression]]s, [[gesture]]s and body semiotics in an effort to develop and communicate meaning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, clothing and fashion are not the same thing, and it is important to understand this. While [[clothing]] is defined as "any covering of the human body",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[fashion]] is defined as the style of dress accepted by members of a society as being appropriate for specific times and occasions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[human body]] is the key element of this non-linguistic semiotic resource. The way one dresses is informed by the biological and social needs of the human being. Central to the semiotics of dress is the psychology of self-perception and self-presentation, both as [[individual]]s who see themselves, as well how individuals are seen within a greater group, [[society]], [[culture]] or [[subculture]].

==Social views==
When the term semiotics is applied to dress, it refers to the words and symbols used to describe the images supporting "the structure of social interaction".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dress Codes: meanings and messages in American culture|last=Rubinstein|first=Ruth|publisher=Westview Press|year=2001|isbn=0813322839|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Examples of these social interactions include: the system of statuses and roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Therefore, the way one dresses can be analyzed as a symbol mechanism to communicate ideas and values with other members in a society, as sociologists [[Erving Goffman]] and Gregory P. Stone have suggested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== ''Symbolism/ideals/values of dress'' ===
According to Ruth Rubinstin, there are three categories for '''clothing signs''': The first, is task oriented or instrumental in nature; the second, is having one primary meaning; and the third, is being recognized as a sign for those who wear it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing that shows or portrays some kind of authority in society would fall in the first category. An example would be military uniforms, wigs used in English courts, or law enforcement uniforms. People who wear this kinds of uniforms and emblems are expected by society to behave in certain ways. Not only that, but it is assumed that they possess certain economic, educational and social statuses.

Clothing that separates the sexes, and creates differences between a male and a female, would fall into the second category of clothing signs according to Rubinstin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Sex differences in clothing are due to "Social judgments, personal evaluation and appropriate expectations of dress".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Because of these, society has coercive power upon colors, shapes and fabrics in the clothes that men and women should wear. Examples of this include men wearing pants, while women are wearing skirts.

Within the third category one may find "seductive attire" as it was labeled by Flugel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} However, wearing sex-specific clothing doesn't necessarily mean one will feel sensual or inclined to have sexual intercourse. Perhaps a better understanding of this could be derived from the church fathers. Who said that seductive attire is a mixture of exposure and coverage of the body. A clothing piece one may use for reference is the ''décollegate'', which was "first in use during the end of the [[Middle Ages]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

'''Symbolism''' in clothing or dress is very much subjective, unlike clothing signs. Symbols in clothing don't represent one's level in a social institution. Therefore, they are not governed by any kind of rules or regulations. Clothing symbols are a reflection of what a specific society believes is valuable at a given time. Using clothing symbols do not imply nothing about a person's rights, duties or obligations, and they should not be used to judge or predict one's behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, to understand and comprehend one through its clothing symbols takes time and intimate comprehension of one's history.

'''Cultural values''' in dress can easily increase an individual's self significance by portraying those good, desirable values in accordance with one's society. This can be further explained by looking at or taking members of the [[Aristocracy (class)|European aristocracy]] as an example. They would wear clothes made with expensive fabrics and ornaments, which would differentiate them from the rest. All in efforts to show others that they possess a privileged place in a social class, where they could not be seen working in a field. Therefore, giving the impression of freedom and relaxation from harsh labor, unlike their servants.

=== ''Men v. women'' ===
Throughout history there has been a separation between the roles and relationships that [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] play. These socially structured differences between men and women have contradicted each other at times. [[Fashion]] has picked up on the tensions left by these contradictions as well. The symbolic separation of men and women is fundamental to the history of dress.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Clothing|last=Kaiser|first=Susan|publisher=Fairchild Publications|year=1997|isbn=1563671077|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} As time has gone by, the forms of clothing (colors, fabrics and shapes) have changed, but the idea of gender difference has survived.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} From an early point in life, children learn to differentiate between a male and a female based on clothing and hairstyles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} An example this may be attributed to television cartoons where superheroines are pictured with strong and muscular bodies. However; due to their clothing, they portray an image or an idea to the viewer of being sexy or attractive, therefore putting her physical strength as a secondary attribute.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

== Psychology in dress ==
Psychologist J. C. Flugel concluded that styles of dress affect one's appearance, yet triggering feelings that enable role performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} This means that when an individual's body and clothes fuse together to form one, then the individual's sense of importance increases. Increments in one's sense of importance yields to feelings and behaviors of being able to control the environment in which one is in. At the same time, this may work backwards. In other words, if one's body and clothes don't come together as a whole, then one may feel embarrassed, and therefore belittle its sense of importance. Flugel called this idea ''Image Contrast''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing can be perceived as one's medium or channel for self-expression.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Every day people communicate ideas and express feelings about them to others through the use of clothing, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} This way of thinking leads to the idea of the ''social self'', which is that the idea of ''self-reflection'' is a social construction.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}}

=== ''Self-perception'' ===
The term ''self-schema'' could be used to defined thought processes that modify, organize and integrate qualities assigned to the self.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}} This idea may include visual images or verbal descriptions that people may use to describe which "look" suits them best and which "look" doesn't.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}}

Teen boys see their selves as more physically effective than teen girls. While at the same time, teen girls perceive themselves as being more effective by means of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|121}} Recently these perceptions among men and women have changed. Women are increasingly concerned with their physical effectiveness, while men have become more interested in their physical attractiveness. Today, unlike men, women are more critical when assessing their bodies in terms of physical fitness, appearance, health and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}} But both men and women tend to be equally satisfied when it comes to their bodies and their self-perceptions.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}}

The '''sievert''' (symbol: '''Sv'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not be confused with the [[sverdrup]] or the [[svedberg]], two non-SI units that sometimes use the same symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] of [[ionizing radiation]] dose in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body. The sievert is of importance in [[dosimetry]] and [[radiation protection]], and is named after [[Rolf Maximilian Sievert]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.

The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as [[equivalent dose]] and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, and [[committed dose]] which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. The sievert is intended to represent the [[stochastic]] health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of [[radiation-induced cancer]] and genetic damage. One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the [[linear no-threshold model]].&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says, "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues." ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt;

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] into equivalent dose and effective dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these. These are under continual review, and changes are advised in the formal "Reports" of those bodies.

Conventionally, the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, such as [[acute radiation syndrome]]; these effects are compared to the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] measured by the unit [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

One sievert equals 100 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]]. The rem is an older, non-SI unit of measurement.

==Definition==

===CIPM definition of the sievert===

The SI definition given by the [[CIPM|International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM)]] says:

"The quantity dose equivalent ''H'' is the product of the absorbed dose ''D'' of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor ''Q'' (quality factor) defined as a function of [[linear energy transfer]] by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|ICRU]]"

:''H'' = ''Q'' × ''D''&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"&gt;{{citation |title=CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ |year=2000 |publisher=BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of ''Q'' is not defined further by CIPM, but it requires the use of the relevant ICRU recommendations to provide this value.

The CIPM also says that "in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose ''D'' and the dose equivalent ''H'', the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose ''D'' and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent ''H''".&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"/&gt;

In summary:

'''The gray''' – quantity ''D''
:1&amp;nbsp;Gy = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a physical quantity. 1&amp;nbsp;Gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kg of matter or tissue.

'''The sievert''' – quantity ''H''
:1&amp;nbsp;Sv = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a biological effect. The sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue.  The equivalence to absorbed dose is denoted by Q.

===ICRP definition of the sievert===
The ICRP definition of the sievert is:&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;
: "The sievert is the special name for the SI unit of equivalent dose, effective dose, and operational dose quantities. The unit is joule per kilogram."

The sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the ICRP and ICRU.

===Naming conventions===
The ICRU/ICRP dose quantities have specific purposes and meanings, but some use common words in a different order. There can be confusion between, for instance, ''equivalent dose'' and ''dose equivalent''.

Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function (Q) of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 60 published in 1991&lt;/ref&gt; developed the "protection" dose quantities ''effective'' and ''equivalent'' dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase ''dose equivalent'' in their name. Only the operational dose quantities which still use Q for calculation retain the phrase ''dose equivalent''. However, there are joint ICRU/ICRP proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities. These were outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015, and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing "dose to lens of eye" and "dose to local skin" as ''equivalent doses''.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

In the [[United states of america|USA]] there are differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2009/pdfs/9444.pdf "The confusing world of radiation dosimetry"] - M.A. Boyd, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009. An account of chronological differences between US and ICRP dosimetry systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External dose quantities==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External radiation dose quantities used in radiological protection]]
The sievert is used to represent the biological effects of different forms of external ionizing radiation on various types of human tissue. Some quantities cannot be practically measured, but they must be related to actual instrumentation and dosimetry measurements. The resultant complexity has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the ICRU working with the ICRP.

The external dose quantities and their relationships are shown in the accompanying diagram. The ICRU is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities, based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology, and the ICRP is primarily responsible for the protection quantities, based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body.

===Physical quantities===
These are directly measurable physical quantities in which no allowance has been made for biological effects. Radiation [[fluence]] is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time, [[Kerma (physics)|kerma]] is the ionising effect of the radiation field, and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass.

===Protection quantities===
Protection quantities are calculated models, and are used as "limiting quantities" to specify exposure limits to ensure, in the words of ICRP, "that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration"&gt;{{citation |title=Calibration of Radiation Protection Monitoring Instruments |series=Safety Reports Series 16 |quote=In 1991, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [7] recommended a revised system of dose limitation, including specification of primary ''limiting quantities'' for radiation protection purposes. These protection quantities are essentially unmeasurable |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/P074_scr.pdf |year=2000 |publisher=IAEA |isbn=92-0-100100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These quantities cannot be measured in practice but their values are derived using models of external dose to internal organs of the human body, using [[Computational human phantom|anthropomorphic phantom]]s. These are 3D computational models of the body which take into account a number of complex effects such as body self-shielding and internal scattering of radiation. The calculation starts with organ absorbed dose, and then applies radiation and tissue weighting factors.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B64&lt;/ref&gt;

As protection quantities cannot practically be measured, operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational quantities===
Operational quantities can be measured in practice, and are the means of measuring dose uptake due to exposure or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment, in relation to protection dose values. In this way they are used for practical dose control, by providing an estimate or upper limit for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure. They are used in practical regulations and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B147&lt;/ref&gt;

The calibration of individual and area dosemeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision "air kerma free in air" under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium. Then the appropriate operational quantity is derived applying a conversion coefficient that relates the air kerma to the appropriate operational quantity. The conversion coefficients for photon radiation are published by the ICRU.&lt;ref&gt;''Measurement of H*(10) and Hp(10) in Mixed High-Energy Electron and Photon Fields.''  E. Gargioni, L. Büermann and H.-M. Kramer Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple (non-anthropomorphic) "phantoms" are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation. The ICRU sphere phantom is based on the definition of an ICRU 4-element tissue-equivalent material which does not really exist and cannot be fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;"Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure,  Actual Shortcomings and Alternative Options", G. Dietze, D.T.  Bartlett, N.E. Hertel, given at IRPA 2012, Glasgow, Scotland. May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRU sphere is a theoretical 30&amp;nbsp;cm diameter "tissue equivalent" sphere consisting of a material with a density of 1 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and a mass composition of 76.2% oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen and 2.6% nitrogen. This material is specified to most closely approximate human tissue in its absorption properties. According to the ICRP, the ICRU "sphere phantom" in most cases adequately approximates the human body as regards the scattering and attenuation of penetrating radiation fields under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B159&lt;/ref&gt; Thus radiation of a particular energy fluence will have roughly the same energy deposition within the sphere as it would in the equivalent mass of human tissue.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

To allow for back-scattering and absorption of the human body, the "slab phantom" is used to represent the human torso for practical calibration of whole body dosimeters. The slab phantom is {{nowrap|300 mm × 300 mm × 150 mm}} depth to represent the human torso.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

The joint ICRU/ICRP proposals outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015 to change the definition of operational quantities would not change the present use of calibration phantoms or reference radiation fields.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

===Instrument and dosimetry response===
This is an actual reading obtained from such as an ambient dose [[gamma ray|gamma]] monitor, or a personal [[dosimeter]]. Such instruments are calibrated using radiation metrology techniques which will trace them to a national radiation standard, and thereby relate them to an operational quantity. The readings of instruments and dosimeters are used to prevent the uptake of excessive dose and to provide records of dose uptake to satisfy radiation safety legislation; such as in the [[UK]], the [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]].

==Calculating protection dose quantities==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of "protection dose" quantities in [[SI]] units]]
The sievert is used in external radiation protection for [[equivalent dose]] (the external-source, whole-body exposure effects, in a uniform field), and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] (which depends on the body parts irradiated).

These dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the [[stochastic]] health effects of radiation, and use of the sievert implies that appropriate [[Relative biological effectiveness|weighting factors]] have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation (expressed in grays).&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=2007 |volume=37 |series=ICRP publication 103 |issue=2–4 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP calculation provides two weighting factors to enable the calculation of protection quantities.
:&amp;nbsp;1. The radiation factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for radiation type ''R'' – This is used in calculating the equivalent dose ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; which can be for the whole body or for individual organs.
:&amp;nbsp;2. The tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for tissue type T being irradiated. This is used with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate the contributory organ doses to arrive at an effective dose ''E'' for non-uniform irradiation.

When a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used, and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose. But if the irradiation of a body is partial or non-uniform the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is used to calculate dose to each organ or tissue. These are then summed to obtain the effective dose. In the case of uniform irradiation of the human body, these summate to 1, but in the case of partial or non-uniform irradiation, they will summate to a lower value depending on the organs concerned; reflecting the lower overall health effect. The calculation process is shown on the accompanying diagram. This approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body, taking into account complete or partial irradiation, and the radiation type or types.
The values of these weighting factors are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types, based on averages of those obtained for the human population.

===Radiation type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{Main article|equivalent dose}}

Since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy, a corrective [[Relative biological effectiveness|radiation weighting factor]] ''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue, is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose.  The result is given the unit sievert.

The equivalent dose is calculated by multiplying the absorbed energy, averaged by mass over an organ or tissue of interest, by a radiation weighting factor appropriate to the type and energy of radiation. To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy dose.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_T = \sum_R W_R \cdot D_{T,R}\ &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue ''T''
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorbed dose in tissue ''T'' by radiation type ''R''
:''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1&amp;nbsp;Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20&amp;nbsp;Sv.

[[File:Neutron radiation weighting factor as a function of kinetic energy.gif|thumb|300px|The radiation weighting factor for neutrons has been revised over time and remains controversial.]]

This may seem to be a paradox. It implies that the energy of the incident radiation field in [[joule]]s has increased by a factor of 20, thereby violating the laws of [[Conservation of energy]]. However, this is not the case. The sievert is used only to convey the fact that a gray of absorbed alpha particles would cause twenty times the biological effect of a gray of absorbed x-rays. It is this biological component that is being expressed when using sieverts rather than the actual energy delivered by the incident absorbed radiation.

===Tissue type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;===

{{Main article|effective dose (radiation)}}
The second weighting factor is the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it is used only if there has been non-uniform irradiation of a body. If the body has been subject to uniform irradiation, the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose, and only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used. But if there is partial or non-uniform body irradiation the calculation must take account of the individual organ doses received, because the sensitivity of each organ to irradiation depends on their tissue type. This summed dose from only those organs concerned gives the effective dose for the whole body. The tissue weighting factor is used to calculate those individual organ dose contributions.

The ICRP values for ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; are given in the table shown here.

The article on [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] gives the method of calculation. The absorbed dose is first corrected for the radiation type to give the equivalent dose, and then corrected for the tissue receiving the radiation. Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

In summary, the sum of tissue-weighted doses to each irradiated organ or tissue of the body adds up to the effective dose for the body. The use of effective dose enables comparisons of overall dose received regardless of the extent of body irradiation.

==Operational quantities==
The operational quantities are used in practical applications for monitoring and investigating external exposure situations. They are defined for practical operational measurements and assessment of doses in the body.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;  Three external operational dose quantities were devised to relate operational dosimeter and instrument measurements to the calculated protection quantities. Also devised were two phantoms, The ICRU "slab" and "sphere" phantoms which relate these quantities to incident radiation quantities using the Q(L) calculation.

===Ambient dose equivalent===
This is used for area monitoring of penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H''*(10). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found 10&amp;nbsp;mm within the ICRU sphere phantom in the direction of origin of the field.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B163 - B164&lt;/ref&gt; An example of penetrating radiation is [[gamma ray]]s.

===Directional dose equivalent===
This is used for monitoring of low penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H'''(0.07). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found at a depth of 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm in the ICRU sphere phantom.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B165- B167&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of low penetrating radiation are alpha particles, beta particles and low-energy photons. This dose quantity is used for the determination of equivalent dose to such as the skin, lens of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Mattsson |first1=Sören |last2=Söderberg |first2=Marcus |title=Radiation Protection in Nuclear Medicine |chapter=Dose Quantities and Units for Radiation Protection |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642311666-c2.pdf |publisher=Springer Verlag |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31167-3 |isbn=978-3-642-31166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In radiological protection practice value of omega is usually not specified as the dose is usually at a maximum at the point of interest.

===Personal dose equivalent===
This is used for individual dose monitoring, such as with a personal dosimeter worn on the body. The recommended depth for assessment is 10&amp;nbsp;mm which gives the quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(10).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B168 - B170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals for changing the definition of protection dose quantities==
In order to simplify the means of calculating operational quantities, and assist in the comprehension of radiation dose protection quantities, ICRP Committee 2 &amp; ICRU Report Committee 26 started in 2010 an examination of different means of achieving this by dose coefficients related to Effective Dose or Absorbed Dose.

Specifically;

1. For area monitoring of effective dose of whole body it would be:

''H'' = Φ × conversion coefficient

The driver for this is that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(10) is not a reasonable estimate of effective dose due to high energy photons, as a result of the extension of particle types and energy ranges to be considered in ICRP report 116. This change would remove the need for the ICRU sphere and introduce a new quantity called ''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;

2. For individual monitoring, to measure deterministic effects on eye lens and skin, it would be:

''D'' = Φ × conversion coefficient for absorbed dose.

The driver for this is the need to measure the deterministic effect, which it is suggested, is more appropriate than stochastic effect. This would calculate equivalent dose quantities ''H''&lt;sub&gt;lens&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;skin&lt;/sub&gt;.

This would remove the need for the ICRU Sphere and the Q-L function. Any changes would replace ICRU report 51, and part of report 57.&lt;ref name= "endo"&gt;"Operational Quantities and new approach by ICRU" – Akira Endo. The 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection, Seoul, Korea – October 20–22, 2015 [http://www.icrp.org/docs/icrp2015/18%20Akira%20Endo%202015.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A final draft report was issued in July 2017 by ICRU/ICRP for consultation. &lt;ref&gt;ICRP draft "Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure" [http://www.icrp.org/docs/ICRU%20and%20ICRP%20Draft%20Joint%20Report%20Operational%20Quantities%20for%20External%20Radiation%20Exposure.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal dose quantities==
{{Main article|Committed dose}}
The sievert is used for human internal dose quantities in calculating [[committed dose]]. This is dose from radionuclides which have been ingested or inhaled into the human body, and thereby "committed" to irradiate the body for a period of time. The concepts of calculating protection quantities as described for external radiation applies, but as the source of radiation is within the tissue of the body, the calculation of absorbed organ dose uses different coefficients and irradiation mechanisms.

The ICRP defines Committed effective dose, E(''t'') as the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;

The ICRP further states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

A committed dose from an internal source is intended to carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of effective dose applied to part of the body.

==Health effects==
Ionizing radiation has [[deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] effects on human health. Deterministic (acute tissue effect) events happen with certainty, with the resulting health conditions occurring in every individual who received the same high dose.  [[Stochastic]] (cancer induction and genetic) events are inherently [[random]], with most individuals in a group failing to ever exhibit any [[causal]] negative health effects after exposure, while an indeterministic random minority do, often with the resulting subtle negative health effects being observable only after large detailed [[epidemiology]] studies.

The use of the sievert implies that only stochastic effects are being considered, and to avoid confusion deterministic effects are conventionally compared to values of absorbed dose expressed by the SI unit gray (Gy).

===Stochastic effects===
Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. The consensus of nuclear regulators, governments and the [[UNSCEAR]] is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per sievert.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;  This is known as the [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT model).

There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peck |first=Donald J. |title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk |url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208060102/http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 December 2010 |publisher=Image Wisely |accessdate=18 May 2012 |last2=Samei |first2=Ehsan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Effects of ionizing radiation: UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes |year=2008 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=978-92-1-142263-4 |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html |accessdate=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic effects===
[[File:Effectofselfrepair.svg|right|250px|thumb| This is a graph depicting the effect of [[dose fractionation]] on the ability of [[gamma rays]] to cause cell death. The blue line is for cells which were not given a chance to recover; the radiation was delivered in one session, the red line is for cells which were allowed to stand for a time and recover. With the pause in delivery conferring [[radioresistance]].]]
The deterministic (acute tissue damage) effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of acute high doses (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h) and are conventionally not measured using the unit sievert, but use the unit gray (Gy).
A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose.

===ICRP dose limits===

The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of report 103. These limits are "situational", for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for the following groups;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Table 8, section 6.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public 
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – All persons exposed

For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period, and for the public to an average of 1&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

For comparison, natural radiation levels inside the US [[United States Capitol|capitol building]] are such that a human body would receive an additional dose rate of 0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the [[granite]] structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program |title=Radiation in the Environment |url=http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211162419/http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conservative ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk (calculated as: 20&amp;nbsp;a·0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a·0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv/mSv·5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%). However, that "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a 10% chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation (see natural [[Epidemiology of cancer]] and [[cancer rates]]).  These estimates are, however, unmindful of every living cell's natural repair mechanisms, evolved over a few billion years of exposure to environmental chemical and radiation threats that were higher in the past, and exaggerated by the evolution of [[oxygen metabolism]].

Significant radiation doses are not frequently encountered in everyday life. The following examples can help illustrate relative magnitudes; these are meant to be examples only, not a comprehensive list of possible radiation doses. An "acute dose" is one that occurs over a short and finite period of time, while a "chronic dose" is a dose that continues for an extended period of time so that it is better described by a dose rate.

==History==
The sievert has its origin in the [[roentgen equivalent man|röntgen equivalent man]] (rem) which was derived from [[CGS units]]. The [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) promoted a switch to coherent SI units in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=Round table on SI units: ICRU Activities |conference=International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association |date=April 1977 |url=http://www.irpa.net/irpa4/cdrom/VOL.2/P2_101.PDF |accessdate=18 May 2012 |location=Paris, France }}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in 1976 that it planned to formulate a suitable unit for equivalent dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=The New Special Names of SI Units in the Field of Ionizing Radiations |journal=British Journal of Radiology |date=May 1976 |volume=49 |pages=476–477 |url=http://bjr.birjournals.org/content/49/581/476.2.full.pdf |accessdate=18 May 2012 |issn=1748-880X |pmid=949584 |last2=Allisy |first2=A. |last3=Lidén |first3=K. |issue=581 |doi=10.1259/0007-1285-49-581-476-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICRP pre-empted the ICRU by introducing the sievert in 1977.&lt;ref name="ICRP26"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recommendations of the ICRP |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=1977 |volume=1 |series=ICRP publication 26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%2026 |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sievert was adopted by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 1980, five years after adopting the gray. The CIPM then issued an explanation in 1984, recommending when the sievert should be used as opposed to the gray. That explanation was updated in 2002 to bring it closer to the ICRP's definition of equivalent dose, which had changed in 1990. Specifically, the ICRP had introduced equivalent dose, renamed the quality factor (Q) to radiation weighting factor (W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), and dropped another weighting factor 'N' in 1990. In 2002, the CIPM similarly dropped the weighting factor 'N' from their explanation but otherwise kept other old terminology and symbols. This explanation only appears in the appendix to the SI brochure and is not part of the definition of the sievert.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{SIbrochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common SI usage==
{{SI unit lowercase|Rolf Maximilian Sievert|sievert|Sv}}

Frequently used [[SI prefixes]] are the millisievert (1&amp;nbsp;mSv = 0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and microsievert (1&amp;nbsp;μSv = 0.000001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and commonly used units for [[time derivative]] or "dose rate" indications on instruments and warnings for radiological protection are μSv/h and mSv/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mSv/a or Sv/a, where they are understood to represent an average over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual limits. The conversion from hours to years varies because of leap years and exposure schedules, but approximate conversions are:

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 8.766&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 114.1&amp;nbsp;μSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

Conversion from hourly rates to annual rates is further complicated by seasonal fluctuations in natural radiation, decay of artificial sources, and intermittent proximity between humans and sources. The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units |year=1950 |publisher=US Department of Commerce |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2012 |series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook |volume=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 8&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;day
: 40&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;week
: 50&amp;nbsp;weeks = 1&amp;nbsp;year

Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 2&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 500&amp;nbsp;µSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

==Ionizing radiation quantities==
[[File:Radioactivity and radiation.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation]]
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
{{Radiation related quantities}}

Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units [[curie]], [[rad (unit)|rad]], and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1004|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]] [[European units of measurement directives]] required that their use for "public health ... purposes" be phased out by 31 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date=1979-12-21
| accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rem equivalence===
An older unit for the dose equivalent is the [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]],&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation: Risks and Realities |url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/402-k-07-006.pdf |work=Radiation: Risks and Realities |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 March 2011 |author=Office of Air and Radiation |author2=Office of Radiation and Indoor Air |page=2 |format=PDF |date=May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; still often used in the United States. One sievert is equal to 100 rem:

'''''Singapore Sling: The Man Who Loved a Corpse''''' ({{lang-el|Singapore Sling: Ο Άνθρωπος που Αγάπησε ένα Πτώμα|italic=yes}}, [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] ''Singapore Sling: O Anthropos pou Agapise ena Ptoma'') is a 1990 Greek [[black and white]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] and regarded as his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]]. Considered a difficult film to label while still managing to develop something of a [[Cult film|cult]] following throughout the years nonetheless, it was shot in a bizarre manner somewhat resembling [[film noir]] or neo-noir and black comedy as well as the [[exploitation film|exploitation]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and crime genres mixed with some elements of eroticism and [[horror film|horror]] with sex being used as a power game and received a theatrical release in Greece on 6 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hardy|editor-first=Phil|editor-link=Phil Hardy (journalist)|year=1995|title=The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror|title-link=The Aurum Film Encyclopedia|volume=3|publisher=New York, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]|pages=478–479|isbn=0-87951-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/08/25/review-singapore-sling-a-man-in-love-with-a-corpse/|title=Review: ''Singapore Sling'' – A Man in Love with a Corpse|website=The Dreamin' Demon: Real Life Horror (Reviews: S)|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Nikolaidis' career as a film director in his home country which stretches to the early 1960s he was almost entirely unknown outside Greece before the early 1990s and is still less known outside it and it was only with this film, which has immediately achieved cult status, that international fame came to him and it probably still remains the film for which he is best known today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/06/22/singapore-sling-18-207547/|title=''Singapore Sling'' (18)|last=Rudd|first=Amy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=22 June 2008|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exemplified by the fact that it was released on DVD by [[Synapse Films]], the only one of Nikolaidis' films to so far receive a home video release in North America. The film was officially selected for screening at the Rimini Film Festival.

==Plot==
Two mentally ill women who are clearly suffering from not otherwise specified delusional disorders, a mother and a (grown) daughter, live together in a secluded mansion. They are in a relationship and both are recognised for their beauty. They spend their days playing perverse [[BDSM]]-related incestuous games in memory of their [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] patriarch who, when he was still alive, raped his daughter when she was eleven, murdered several servants, and is now a mummified corpse with which the daughter is shown having sex. They occasionally kill their servants and bury their bodies in the garden.

When first glimpsed the psychotic mother-daughter protagonists, half-dressed, are burying their disemboweled chauffeur into a pit, they have just finished to dig in their backyard on a dark and stormy night with thunder and heavy rain. They lay down their shovels and drag out of the bushes, his fresh corpse. He was killed in one of their usual games combining incestuous sex with murder. Shortly after this and at first unnoticed by the two women, a lovesick detective pulls his car up to the residence. He is suffering from a painful bullet wound and an equally painful yearning to track down Laura, his long-missing beloved for whom he has been searching for three years and about whom it is known that she has visited the area. What he does not yet know is that he has stumbled onto the lair of two profoundly insane women who have already lured Laura into their home and brutally killed her (in the process decorating their kitchen with her viscera, as a flashback helpfully shows). It is also revealed that the daughter is physically very similar to Laura and is desperately looking for a man's companionship. 

The duo then easily take the seriously wounded and bleeding detective, having already figured them out to be responsible for Laura's kidnapping, into their home, essentially kidnapping him. As the exhausted detective was silent and apparently refuses to speak, even in order to state his own name, the two women christen him 'Singapore Sling', after they discover a recipe in his pocket notebook for that type of [[Singapore Sling|cocktail]]. They use him as a pawn in their sexually tinged [[Sexual roleplay|role-playing games]] and as a party to their distorted and perverse form of entertainment, during which Singapore Sling, now a prisoner, is tied up, chained to a bed, vomited on, electrocuted, used as a sex slave, and subjected to various other forms of torture and atrocities in which he is forced to participate. However, as Singapore Sling's confinement wears on he regains his strength and takes a more active role in the games. His deranged captors become concerned and alarmed when a sharp kitchen knife, belonging to the late father, goes missing and they discover Singapore Sling digging a deep hole in their backyard. As psychotic as these two are, they are still lucid enough to recognize that a killing is imminent, if not two or even three. In an atmosphere of decadence and dark madness, the characters gradually sink into the depths of their subconscious mind.

A few days later, the daughter decides that she is fed up with having to suffer under the yoke of maternal authority, and, together with Singapore Sling, murders her mother. Singapore Sling then takes what up until now used to be the mother's role in the sexual games. However, during one of these games, a reenactment of Laura's murder, he stabs the daughter, playing Laura, with the aforementioned missing kitchen knife now attached to his penis. The daughter, while bleeding to death, shoots Singapore Sling and then he goes out to the garden and falls into the pit which he himself had recently dug. The film hence ends, in short, with all three characters dead.

==Cast==
* Meredyth Herold as Daughter
* Panos Thanassoulis as Detective Singapore Sling
* Michele Valley as Mother

==Themes==
The film's protagonist's search for a woman named Laura is a direct reference to the classic [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) by American director [[Otto Preminger]]. The film uses as background music, in addition to classical music by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], the compositions used by [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Julie London]] in ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).

==Reception==
Director [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] said the following about this film's reception during an interview: "When I was shooting ''Singapore Sling'', I was under the impression that I was making a comedy with elements taken from Ancient Greek Tragedy... Later, when some European and American critics characterized it as 'one of the most disturbing films of all times,' I started to feel that something was wrong with me. Then, when British censors banned its release in England, I finally realized that something is wrong with all of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cult-cinema.ru/reviews/s/singapore_sling/|script-title=ru:''Singapore Sling''/''Сингапурский Слинг'' (1990)|last=Меренков|first=Сергей|date=21 December 2007|website=CULT Cinema: Рецензин, S|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic neo-psychedelia band [[Singapore Sling (band)|Singapore Sling]] is named after the film. As the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson explained in a June 2003 interview with Belgium's [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: "We had a first gig. It was booked and we didn't have a name and I had been looking for a film called ''Singapore Sling'' for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere. It sounded cool, so that became the name of the band. It's some kind of dark, perverse [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] film from 1990.

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

In [[landscape ecology]], '''spatial configuration''' describes the spatial pattern of patches in a [[landscape]]. Most traditional spatial configuration measurements take into account aspects of patches within the landscape, including patches' size, shape, density, [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]] and [[fractal dimension]]. Other measurements are [[pixel]]-based, such as contagion and [[lacunarity]]. Together with [[spatial composition]], spatial configuration is a basic component of landscape heterogeneity indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gustafson, E.J. |title=Quantifying landscape spatial pattern: what is the state of the art? |journal=Ecosystems |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–156 |year=1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1007/s100219900011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15084">'''Specific absorption rate''' ('''SAR''') is a measure of the rate at which [[energy]] is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the human body when exposed to a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electromagnetic field]]. It can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun |first1= J|last2= Hynynen |first2= K |title=Focusing of therapeutic ultrasound through a human skull: a numerical study |journal=[[J Acoust Soc Am]] |origyear= September 1998 |pmid=9745750 |date=2013-08-12 | bibcode=1998ASAJ..104.1705S| volume=104| pages=1705–15| doi=10.1121/1.424383|issue=3 Pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the [[Power (physics)|power]] absorbed per [[mass]] of [[body tissue|tissue]] and has units of [[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Jianming |last= Jin | title= Electromagnetic Analysis and Design in Magnetic Resonance Imaging | year= 1998 | publisher= CRC Press | isbn= 978-0-8493-9693-9 | pages = §5.3.3 pp. 226ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kshetrimayum|first= Rakhesh Singh|author-link= Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum|title= Mobile Phones: Bad for your Health?|journal= IEEE Potentials|volume= 27|issue= 2|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475802/?arnumber=4475802 |doi= 10.1109/MPOT.2008.919701|date= March-April 2008|pages= 18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1&amp;nbsp;g or 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue). The value cited is then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated volume or mass.

== Calculation ==

SAR for electromagnetic energy can be calculated from the [[electric field]] within the tissue as:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SAR} = \frac{1}{V}\int_\textrm{sample} \frac{\sigma(\mathbf{r}) |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})|^2}{\rho(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[electrical conductivity]]
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] electric field
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[density]]
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the sample
SAR measures exposure to fields between 100&amp;nbsp;kHz and 10&amp;nbsp;GHz (known as radio waves).&lt;ref name=icnirp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|title=ICNIRP Guidelines For Limiting Exposure To The Time-Varying Electric, Magnetic And Electromagnetic Fields (Up To 300 GHz)|publisher=[[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]]|year=1998|accessdate=2013-12-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044606/http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to measure power absorbed from [[mobile phones]] and during [[MRI]] scans. The value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile phone model, and at the intended position of use.

=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
When measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a "SAR Phantom") in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone's antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user's body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:

*[[United States]]: the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.
*[[European Union]]: [[CENELEC]] specify SAR limits within the EU, following [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue absorbing the most signal ([http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/033746 IEC 62209-1]).
*[[India]]: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands free mode.&lt;ref name=IAreg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87152 |title=Stringent Mobile Radiation Standards Come into Force from tomorrow New Mobile Handsets to comply with SAR Value of 1.6W/KG - Penalty, Random Checks Introduced for Enforcement |publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.
To check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer's website.

=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===
For Magnetic Resonance Imaging the limits (described in [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/043851?opendocument IEC 60601-2-33]) are slightly more complicated:

:'''Note''': Averaging time of 6 minutes.
(a) Local SAR is determined over the mass of 10&amp;nbsp;g.

(b) The limit scales dynamically with the ratio "exposed patient mass / patient mass":

NORMAL OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (8&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)&lt;br&gt;
FIRST LEVEL CONTROLLED OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (6&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)

(c) In cases where the orbit is in the field of a small local RF transmit coil, care should be taken to ensure that the temperature rise is limited to 1&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Criticism ==

SAR limits set by law do not consider that the human body is particularly sensitive to the power peaks or frequencies responsible for the [[Microwave auditory effect|microwave hearing effect]].&lt;ref name="frey2"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |last=Frey|first= Allan H|accessdate=| pmid=13895081 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frey-headaches"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first= Allan H  |title=Headaches from cellular telephones: are they real and what are the implications? |year=1998 |volume=106 |publisher=[[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |pmc=1533043 |issue=3|doi=10.1289/ehp.98106101|pages=101–103 |pmid=9441959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frey reports that the microwave hearing effect occurs with average power density exposures of 400 μw/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, well below SAR limits (as set by government regulations).&lt;ref name="frey2" /&gt;

Notes:

In comparison to the short term, relatively intensive exposures described above, for long term environmental exposure of the general public there is a limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the whole body.&lt;ref name=icnirp/&gt; A whole-body average SAR of 0.4&amp;nbsp;W/kg has been chosen as the restriction that provides adequate protection for occupational exposure. An additional safety factor of 5 is introduced for exposure of the public, giving an average whole-body SAR limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg.

=== FCC advice ===
The FCC Guide, "Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You," after detailing the limitations of SAR values, offers the following "bottom line" editorial:

{{quote|"ALL cell phones must meet the FCC’s RF exposure standard, which is set at a level well below that at which laboratory testing indicates, and medical and biological experts generally agree, adverse health effects could occur. For users who are concerned with the adequacy of this standard or who otherwise wish to further reduce their exposure, the most effective means to reduce exposure are to hold the cell phone away from the head or body and to use a speakerphone or hands-free accessory. These measures will generally have much more impact on RF energy absorption than the small difference in SAR between individual cell phones, which, in any event, is an unreliable comparison of RF exposure to consumers, given the variables of individual use." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cell-phones-what-it-means-you |title=Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In order to find out possible advantages and the interaction mechanisms of Electromagnetic fields (EMF), the minimum SAR (or intensity) that could have biological effect (MSBE) would be much more valuable in comparison to studying high intensity fields. Such studies can possibly shed light on thresholds of non-ionizing radiation effects and cell capabilities (e.g., oxidative response). In addition, it is more likely to reduce the complexity of the EMF interaction targets in cell cultures by lowering the exposure power, which at least reduces the overall rise in temperature. This parameter might differ regarding the case under study and depends on the physical and biological conditions of the exposed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sefidbakht|first1= Yahya|last2= Moosavi-Movahedi |first2= Ali Akbar|last3= Hosseinkhani|first3= Saman |last4= Khodagholi|first4= Fariba|last5= Torkzadeh-Mahani|first5= Masoud|last6= Foolad |first6= Forough|last7= Faraji-Dana|first7= Reza|title=Effects of 940 MHz EMF on Bioluminescence and Oxidative Response of Stable Luciferase Producing HEK Cells|journal=Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences |date=April 2014|volume=13|issue=7|page=1082|doi=10.1039/C3PP50451D|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/PP/2014/c3pp50451d#!divAbstract|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The F-Word''''' is a book by lexicographer and linguist [[Jesse Sheidlower]] surveying the history and usage of the English word ''[[fuck]]'' and a wide variety of [[euphemism]]s that replace it. Sheidlower examines 16th and 17th century poetry, 20th century literature, and 21st century media uses of the word.

The book was first published in 1995 by [[Random House]], which also published the second edition in 1999. [[Oxford University Press]] published a revised and expanded third edition in 2009, featuring a foreword by comedian [[Lewis Black]].

'''''The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters''''', or ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', as it was originally known in Dutch, is a series of artist biographies with engraved portraits written by the 18th-century painter [[Arnold Houbraken]]. It was published in three volumes as a sequel to [[Karel van Mander]]'s own list of biographies known as the ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''. The first volume appeared in 1718, and was followed by the second volume in 1719, the year Houbraken died. The third and last volume was published posthumously by Houbraken's wife and children in 1721. This work is considered to be a very important source of information on 17th-century artists of the Netherlands. The ''Schouburg'' is listed as one of the 1000 most important works in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] from the Middle Ages to today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and influence==
The ''Schouburg'' was not the first sequel to Karel van Mander's work. Various authors had attempted to illustrate Van Mander's work and in 1649, [[Jan Meyssen]] published ''Image de divers hommes'' in imitation of [[Van Dyck|Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''. [[Cornelis de Bie]] published his ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]'' in 1662, [[André Félibien]] published his ''Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellents peintres anciens et modernes'' in 1666, and these were followed by [[Jacob von Sandrart]]'s illustrated ''Teutsche Akademie'' in 1668. Houbraken was very familiar with ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'', 1678, published by his teacher [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten|Samuel van Hoogstraten]] for students of art. [[Roger de Piles]] published ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres'' in the 1690s followed by [[Florent le Comte]] with his ''Cabinet des singularitez'' in 1699. As a gifted engraver, Houbraken wished to correct mistakes and omissions in these earlier works, while updating biographies with engraved portraits of artists. All of these works were used as sources for Houbraken and he mentions them in the first chapter of his first volume.

The ''Schouburg'' was published in three volumes, the first of which was simply meant as an addendum to Karel van Mander's work, and listed about 200 artists born between 1466 (starting with [[Erasmus]]) and 1613 (ending with [[Jacques van Artois]]) that had been omitted or whose lives extended beyond Van Mander's 1604 publication date. The popularity of this volume was such that a second volume was prepared immediately, while plans were made to continue the project up to the period in which Houbraken was writing at the start of the 18th century.

While leaning heavily on the sources already mentioned, Houbraken also consulted local history books of various cities in the Netherlands. Other, unpublished sources for his material came from various contacts via his professional network, mostly members of [[Guild of St. Luke|St. Luke Guilds]] in Holland. He listed many men who became members of the [[Bentvueghels]] group in [[Rome]] while on their [[Grand Tour]], but he also listed most of the men in a competency list drawn up by [[Vincent van der Vinne]] before he died in 1702. Houbraken kept to a system of importance where capitals meant very important, and lower case were honorable mentions. Though the capitalized names were meant for the index, the index of the first volume was far from complete at the time of publication. A later edition of all three books in 1756 contains an improved index and this book is now available on line in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]].

===Notable omissions===
The absence from Houbraken's work of several painters who are now much more highly regarded than very many painters he considered noteworthy, is an interesting feature of the work, and reveals changes in taste since his time; the most notorious omission is [[Jan Vermeer]], who is mentioned once in passing.  One must not forget however, that Houbraken himself died before publishing the final work, and he mentions again and again the impossibility of a complete list. In his first volume he includes painters that he complained were oversights by Karel van Mander, who he regarded as his greatest example. He highly respected all artist biographers who came before him, such as Sandrart, de Bie, and de Lairesse. In fact, Houbraken was quite keen to include painters that he thought were overlooked before him, and was quite thorough in his endeavors. Therefore, his omissions are equally the omissions of previous biographers, though it is Houbraken who receives all the blame. Unfortunately we don't know the exact state of his book at the time of his death, but his son Jacob, his daughter Antonina, and his wife all helped to patch things up for publication, and it is quite possible that their own opinions slipped into the finished work. In general, Houbraken tends to follow the contemporary prejudices of the [[hierarchy of genres]] and undervalue [[landscapist]]s, [[marine artist]]s and painters of [[still life]]. One can also speak of certain prejudices of the Houbraken family. These were in order:

* '''Family dynasties''': All painters who made up a family dynasty received extra space in the book. More space was given to the founder of the dynasty than to any other member (note that Houbraken considered himself the founder of his own family dynasty). An example is that though [[Rachel Ruysch]] was the most famous painter of her family, Houbraken devotes more space to her grandfather Pieter Post and his brother Frans. Similarly, though [[Wouter Crabeth II]] was the most famous painter of the family, Houbraken devotes more space to his illustrious heritage in Gouda, the glass painters Dirk and Wouter.
* '''Engravers''': Houbraken had a business of his own in biographical engravings, and his large family probably all helped in the business, with his son and daughter helping with the oval portraits. Houbraken was quick to realize the importance of reprints, and used them whenever possible for art provenance. He highly respected good engravings. Therefore he was heavily prejudiced towards artists who were also good draftsmen and engravers, such as Rembrandt and the Visschers. He includes also notes about various publishers and engravers, who did not paint at all.
* '''Rome''': Houbraken had great respect for all artists who took the trouble and overcame many hardships to travel to Rome. He went to great pains to add entries for the entire list of painters mentioned in a poem about the [[Bentvueghels]].
* '''Flattery''': As a Mennonite, Houbraken would have been against flattery; however, he writes again and again of the importance of flattering one's patrons in his books, and a recurring theme is when an artist fell onto bad times because he failed to flatter his patron. This type of artist is admired by Houbraken as a sort of "martyr to the artist's cause". Examples of flatterers that Houbraken deprecates are Anthony van Dyck  and Sir Peter Lely followers, and his omissions speak for themselves if we note famous portrait painters of his day such as [[Adriaen Hanneman]], [[Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck]] and [[Thomas de Keyser]]. Similarly, though architecture was considered one of the highest genre's, the popular "family portrait with a view of the house or garden" was omitted as a genre entirely from Houbraken's praise, since this just showed off the wealth of the sitters. Thus landscape-portraitists were often omitted or deprecated, such as [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]] and his wife.
* '''Religion''': Certainly Houbraken included artists of all religions in his book, but we can say that Mennonites are over-represented (see his story on the Mennonite martyr [[Jan Woutersz van Cuyck]]), while Catholics are under-represented. These were the De Grebbers, the De Brays, the Ruisdael family, Jan Vermeer, [[Adriaen Coorte]], Adriaen Hanneman, Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck, [[Hendrick Dubbels]], [[Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen]], [[Meindert Hobbema]], and others.

Other notorious omissions are [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Jan Wynants]], [[Jacobus Mancadan]],  [[Hendrick Avercamp]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer, Ruysch, and Leyster were mentioned, but only briefly.  The subject is dealt with in ''Arnold Houbraken's "Groote Schouburgh" and the Canon of Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting'', by Bart Cornelis, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 26, No. 3 (1998), pp. 144-161, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780895 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schilderessen==
Translated, the title of the book is ''Theatre of Painters and Paintresses'', indicating that Houbraken wrote about women painters, or ''schilderessen''. However, the list of women he included in the book is really quite short. Though he included short biographies of very many painters who were closely related to women painters, the only paintresses he included by name were: [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Anna Francisca de Bruijns]], [[Mayken Verhulst]], [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Margaretha van Godewijk]], [[Maria de Grebber]] (sister of [[Pieter de Grebber]]), [[Maria Potter]], [[Alida Withoos]], [[Catharina Oostfries]] (from a glaspainting family, married glasspainter [[Claes van der Meulen]]), [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Geertgen Wyntges]] (who he mentions as being the servant of Maria van Oosterwijk), [[Anna Katrina]], [[Catharina Rozee]] (1632–82), [[Adriana Spilberg]] (daughter of [[Johannes Spilberg]]), [[Rachel Ruysch]], the three sisters [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Françoise Katharina van Thielen]], and [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Marie Duchatel]], [[Diana Glauber]], [[Maria Sybilla Merian]], [[Margaretha Wulfraet]], and [[Johanna Koerten Blok]]. Of these, he included illustrations of only three women: Schurman, Merian, and Koerten-Blok. Houbraken also mentioned two poetesses; [[Gesina Brit]] and [[Catharina Questiers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">The '''torque effect''' experienced in helicopters and single propeller-powered aircraft is an example of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's Third Law|third law]] of motion that "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."

In helicopters, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. A small tail rotor is the most common configuration to counter the torque effect.

In a single-propeller plane, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the plane to want to turn upwards and left in response to the propeller wanting to turn (bank) the plane in the opposite direction of the propeller spin.

'''Transilvania University of Brașov''' ({{lang-ro|Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov}}; '''UniTBv''') is a public institution of higher education in [[Brașov]], [[Romania]], founded in 1971. It has eighteen faculties, a total of over 19,000 students, and more than 700 academic staff. The University offers 105 days license areas, 12 areas for distance education, and 5 areas for higher reduced frequency, as well as 73 graduate programs and 18 doctoral programs.

==History==
University level education came to be and evolved through the city of Brașov's strong cultural tradition and climate. Early notable cultural nuclei include the [[First Romanian School]], the first printing press (introduced by Deacon Coresi), the [[Johannes Honterus]] High School, the activity centered on the newspaper '[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]' (founded by [[George Baritiu|George Barițiu]]), and many others.

The first higher education school in Brașov was founded in 1940 in the form of the 'Academy of Commercial and Industrial Studies', followed by the 'Institute of Forestry' and the 'Institute of Mechanics' in 1948 and 49 respectively. Following 1953, these merge into the 'Polytechnic Institute of Brașov', while 1960 sees the establishment of another institute, with departments of [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]], followed by the founding of a department of Music in 1969.

In 1971 the 'University of Brașov' is founded by the merger of all higher education institutes through the [[Romanian Communist Party|Council of Ministers]]' Decision no. 1285/15 October. There were eight departments at the time: Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]], Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of [[Forestry]], Faculty of Wood Industry, Faculty of Mathematics and [[Computer Science]], Faculty of [[Physics]]–[[Chemistry]], Faculty of Natural and [[Agricultural Science]] and the Faculty of Music.

Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the university changed its name to that of today, the '"Transilvania" University of Brașov'.

Since then, a number of other departments have been set up: [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Economics]] (both in 1990), [[Medicine]] (1991), [[Psychology]] &amp; [[Methodology]] (1995). In 1995, the Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering was split into the Faculty of Technologic Engineering and the Faculty of the Science and Engineering of Materials. Two colleges were also founded that year, that of Forestry and that of 'Economics and Computer Science'.

In 2001, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering expanded its array of specializations; thus it had its name changed to the 'Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'.

In 2008 Transilvania University celebrated 60 years of existence, crowned with a spot at the top of the Romanian academic space.

Starting with the academic year 2005-2006, courses are organized to correspond with the [[Bologna Process]].

==Ranking==
According to the [[Scimago Lab]], based on data collected between 2007 and 2011, Transilvania University of Brașov ranked 1710 in the World, 113 regionally and 11 in the country by publication output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scimagoir.com/ Scimago Institutions Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2984">The '''Welsh Agricultural College''' (WAC) was established in Aberystwyth, Wales in 1970. In 1995 it merged with [[Aberystwyth University]].

==Establishment==
In an unusual arrangement, the College was financed through a joint committee composed of representatives of all the Welsh local authorities. Its original mission in 1970 was to provide vocational education in agriculture (NDA and HND) and for a number of years it provided National and Higher National Diploma courses. An HND took 4 years and included extensive work experience on farms. 

It shared a campus with the Welsh College of Librarianship at Llanbadarn. The first intake of 34 tudents was in 1971, when the buildings were unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/tortuous-beginnings-welsh-agricultural-college-2685988&lt;/ref&gt; The College acquired Frondeg dairy farm and a beef and sheep unit at Tan y Graig.

Dr DW Dai Morris was the first Principal. 

==Degrees and students==
WAC later diversified its provision to include courses in Countryside Management and Equine Studies.  A degree scheme in Agriculture, offered jointly with the University of Wales Aberystwyth’s Department of Agricultural Sciences, was established in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/university/history/timelinepart3/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Student from this period were typically UK applicants who wanted an applied course, or had not gained places at more established agricultural colleges ([[Wye College]], [[Royal Agricultural College]] in Cirencester, [[Harper_Adams_University |Harper Adams College]] etc.). Some were sons or daughters of Welsh farmers. 

The College had a small contingent of young lecturing staff (Professor Wynne Jones OBE 1970s-1988, latterly Principal of [[Harper_Adams_University | Harper Adams College]]; Dr John Harries 1974-1995, former Principal of WAC and Pro-Vice Chancellor of [[Aberystwyth University]]).

==Disestablishment and merger==
In 1995 the Welsh Agricultural College merged with the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]'s Department of Agricultural Sciences to form its Institute of Rural Studies, with Michael Haines appointed as its first Director. 

It was later renamed the Institute of Rural Sciences. In 2008 it was merged with the university's Institute of Biological Sciences and the independent Institute of Grassland and Environmental Sciences (IGER)to form the [[Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences]] (IBERS).

The '''World Vegetable Center''' ({{zh|c=亞蔬—世界蔬菜中心}}), previously known as the '''Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center''', is an international, [[nonprofit]] institute for [[vegetable]] research and development. It was founded in 1971 in Shanhua, southern Taiwan, by the [[Asian Development Bank]], Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Taiwan"&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/-business/2008/07/11/164969/Taiwan-vegetable.htm "Taiwan vegetable center to open CentAm branch"], [[The China Post]], July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomato"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8NR12W1-B0IC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22World+Vegetable+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fG2dTMjYO4G8lQfIpb3lCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22World%20Vegetable%20Center%22&amp;f=false Tomato yellow leaf curl virus disease]: ''management, molecular biology, breeding for resistance'' by Henryk Czosnek, シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2007, Pg. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

These countries wished for the Center to become the "facilitator" for the Collaborative Vegetable Research Network for Southeast Asia, which was to work toward completing various projects that the founding nations put forth. Overall, the main goal of this continues to be to "reduce [[malnutrition]] and alleviate [[poverty]] in [[developing nations]] through improving production and consumption of vegetables."&lt;ref name="Taiwan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomato" /&gt;

==Research and development==
The use of vegetables as crops that are of high worth is important in the "[[Sustainable Development Goals]]" of the United Nations Development Program and the World Vegetable Center. &lt;ref&gt;United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. [https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/]&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetables bred by the Center can be used in poorer areas, where they can serve as "an important source of income" and can help fight [[micronutrient]] deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger KM, Lumpkin TA. 2005. Horticulture for Poverty Alleviation – The Unfunded Revolution. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=781784&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center’s current crop portfolio focuses on four groups of globally important vegetables, according to the AVRDC:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avrdc.org/fileadmin/pdfs/For_you/AVRDC-HQ.pdf AVRDV - World Vegetable Center Info PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*solanaceous crops: ([[tomato]], sweet pepper, [[chili pepper]], [[eggplant]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Research-and-evidence/case-studies/research-case-studies/2012/The-great-pyramid-Ty-tomatoes-resist-pests-and-diseases-/ The great pyramid: Ty tomatoes resist pests and diseases] [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/ R4D]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*bulb [[alliums]] ([[onion]], [[shallot]], [[garlic]])
:*crucifers ([[cabbage]], [[Chinese cabbage]])
:*cucurbits ([[Cucurbitaceae]]): ([[cucumbers]], [[pumpkins]])

Indigenous vegetables, particularly those of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] are another focus of research at the World Vegetable Center. Indigenous vegetables are domesticated or semi-wild vegetable crops that are grown in particular regions as an integral part of a local [[food]] system. Many of them are [[underutilized crops]],&lt;ref&gt;New Agriculturalist. 2008. Making more of undervalued crops. http://www.new-ag.info/pov/views.php?a=426&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in regions where they are not native.&lt;ref&gt;Vikram, [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-2162920,flstry-1.cms "How green was my veggie"], [[The Economic Times]], June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germplasm collection==
A collection of vegetable [[germplasm]] is kept at the World Vegetable Center, which is considered to have the "largest and most diverse collection...in the world.".&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO]. 2009.

In 1978–1984, Blum served as [[Israel Ambassador to the United Nations]].

==Biography==
Yehuda Z. Blum was born in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1931, and observed his [[Bar mitzvah|bar-mitzvah]] in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camp. He immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Blum1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Zvi Blum|title=For Zion's sake|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlCHQ6LU988C&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=24 December 2010|date=30 November 1987|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-8453-4809-3|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum earned his law degree from the [[University of London]].

==Law career==
Blum joined the faculty of [[Hebrew University]] in 1965 and until retiring in 2001 occupied the [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] Chair in [[International Law]] there.  He has served as a senior research scholar at the [[University of Michigan]], and visiting professor in the law schools of the [[University of Texas]], [[New York University]], [[Tulane University]], the [[USC Gould School of Law]], and others. In 1968 he served as a [[UNESCO]] Fellow at the [[University of Sydney]] in [[Australia]]. He has written several books and published many scholarly articles on international legal problems in law journals in English, Hebrew and German. He is currently the law editor of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Hebraica]].''

==Diplomatic career==
In 1968, Blum worked for the [[United Nations]] Office of Legal Counsel. He was a member of Israeli delegation to 3rd UN Conference on the [[Law of the Sea]] in 1973. In 1976 he was part of the Israeli delegation to the 31st session of [[UN General Assembly]]. He served as Ambassador and [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations]] for six years, from 1978 to 1984.

He was a member of the Israeli negotiating team that drafted the peace treaty with Egypt ([[Camp David Accords]]) in 1978,  the [[Blair House]] negotiations in March 1979 and the Israeli legal team at the Taba arbitration talks between Israel and [[Egypt]] between 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="HU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.huji.ac.il/eng/segel.asp?staff_id=62&amp;cat=545 |title=Faculty of Law website |accessdate=2010-12-23 |publisher=Hebrew University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ambassador to the United Nations, Blum was often critical of it, saying that the UN "fans the flames of the Middle East conflict."  ''The New York Times'' quoted him as saying that "The essence of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict|Middle East conflict]] has always been and remains the persistent enmity of [[Arab states]] towards the Jewish national renaissance."&lt;ref name="NYT-Fans"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/world/israeli-says-un-fans-the-flames-of-middle-east-conflict.html |title=Israeli says UN fans the flames of Middle East conflict |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |author=Richard Bernstein |date=October 1983}} "For decades now, Arab leaders have obstinately maintained that the whole region from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Persian Gulf]] must be exclusively Arab, he said."&lt;/ref&gt;
As UN envoy, he made headlines for "scolding" a group of 133 American Jewish law students protesting Israel's invasion of [[Lebanon]]  and protesting [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlements]] in [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].  He questioned the factual, as well as the moral position, of the students' view, saying that they "have not given the slightest indication of their willingness to bear any personal consequences of their patronizing and fortuitous advice."  &lt;ref name="NYT-students"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/world/israeli-envoy-at-un-scolds-133-us-jewish-law-students.html |title=Israeli envoy at UN Scolds 133 Jewish Law Students |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
