'''Abdul Vas''' (born 15 March 1981 in [[Maracay]], [[Venezuela]]) is a contemporary artist. He grew up living between [[Surinam]], [[Guyana]], and [[Belgium]]. After studies at EAVRA in Maracay and at the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]] in [[Amsterdam]] he lives and works in Amsterdam and [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcthemagazine.com/arc/2013/03/abdul-vas-shoot-to-thrill-curated-by-alexis-callado-estefania-casado-santapau-gallery-madrid/ Abdul Vas’ Shoot to Thrill-Curated by Alexis Callado Estefania-Casado Santapau Gallery] [[ARC Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has created handmade [[books]] and [[zines]], [[photographs]], [[collages]], [[drawings]], [[paintings]] and [[murals]].

== Work ==

Abdul Vas work broaches heavily the obsessions of his home country Venezuela with the symbols of the American dream. Heavily influenced by [[Marc Chagall]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Al Feldstein]] and [[James Ensor]], Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung [[rooster]]s that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[MLB]], [[Malcolm Young]],  [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Slayer]], [[Metallica]], [[the Black Crowes]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[SUV]]s, [[rock and roll]] and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the [[Navistar]] trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group [[AC/DC]], particularly lead singer [[Brian Johnson]]. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.

'''''Andromeda Chained to the Rocks''''' (1630) is a 34 x 25 oil on panel painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Rembrandt]]. It is now in the [[Mauritshuis]],  [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. Andromeda represents Rembrandt's first full length mythological female nude [[history painting]] and is taken from a story in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

==Mythology==
In Metamorphoses, [[Andromeda (mythology)]] is the daughter of an Ethiopian king and queen, [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. Cassiopeia was very boastful about her beauty, and asserted that she was more beautiful than [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the queen of the gods and the Nereids. Insulted by Cassiopeia's assertions, [[Neptune]] sent a sea monster to the Ethiopian coast. Neptune then could only be appeased upon the sacrifice of Andromeda, the kings beautiful virgin daughter, to the sea monster. Andromeda was chained naked to rocks by the coast, awaiting the sea monster. [[Perseus]], passing by, had noticed the beautiful girl and made a deal with her parents that he would save her, should he be allowed to have her hand in marriage. The king and queen agree and Andromeda was spared.&lt;ref name="Ovid, book iv, myth ix"&gt;Ovid, book iv, myth ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damsel in distress==
This painting depicts a classic example of the [[damsel in distress]]. In this theme a beautiful young woman is placed in a perilous situation, usually involving a monster or being trapped in captivity. The damsel can then only be rescued by a hero, whom of which she usually ends up marrying. In this painting, Andromeda has a distressed look on her face as she is completely shackled and unable to move. Although Perseus does not make an appearance in this painting, in similar works we can see Perseus being portrayed in a heroic and graceful light, shown through the use of warm colors and heroic poses.

==Depiction of beauty==
Many artists such as [[Titian]] have depicted this story by showing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], her rescuer Perseus, and the sea monster all in the same composition. Her beauty as described in her source material can be seen in some of these other works, along with Perseus' role as her rescuer. In this work, Rembrandt shies away from classical conventions by showing her not as a glamorous beauty but as a frightened naturalistic looking girl.  No other figure is included, but her alarmed look out of the picture space to the right creates narrative tension.  The painting is an example of Rembrandt's rejection of idealized beauty. Since he did not believe true beauty existed naturally, he painted women as he saw them; naturally imperfect and flawed.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 11"&gt;Clark, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rembrandt's subsequent nude mythological paintings from this period ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto|Diana Bathing]]'' and ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' show his evolving portrayal of the nude.

In June 2017, site editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins hosted a screening and discussion of films by designers and filmmakers [[Saul Bass]] and [[Elaine Bass]] at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linthicum|first1=Ryan|title=Movies at SAAM: Summer 2017|url=https://americanart.si.edu/blog/eye-level/2017/20/55908/movies-saam-summer-2017|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Art of the Title was founded by motion designer Ian Albinson and launched in 2007 as a blog intending to highlight the design of title sequences.

In 2008, Alexander Ulloa joined the site as Head Writer. Over the next few years, the site expanded with the addition of writers and editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins, now Managing Editor and Senior Editor, respectively.

In 2011, the Art of the Title team curated the title design section of the ''Graphic Design — Now in Production'' exhibition, co-organized by the [[Walker Art Center]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Graphic Design: Now In Production | publisher = Walker Art Center | date = 2011 | url = http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/graphic-design-now-in-production | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ran from October 22, 2011 – January 22, 2012 at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and then was taken on a tour including stints in New York, Los Angeles, Grand Rapids, Houston, Winston-Salem, and Providence. A comprehensive, illustrated catalogue produced by the [[Walker Art Center]] and featuring an 18-page section on title design curated and written by Art of the Title accompanies the exhibition.

In 2012, the site launched a redesign developed in partnership with New Zealand-based studio CactusLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2012: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2011 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2012-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesign adopted a responsive structure, allowing the site to "seamlessly adapt from desktop to mobile" and to provide "better cross-referencing of data alongside new bio pages for title designers and studios."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Art of the Title • Web Projects • Work • CactusLab | publisher = CactusLab | date = 2012 | url = http://www.cactuslab.com/work/art-of-the-title/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the site went down temporarily when its [[Iron Man 3]] article was linked from [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]'s Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the site announced an exclusive look at the James Bond ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' title sequence, which turned out to be a [[rickroll]]. Readers' reactions ran the gamut from outrage to kudos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of the Title – NEW: An exclusive look... |url=https://twitter.com/ArtoftheTitle/status/583290327152250880|website=Twitter|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SXSW Title Design Awards===
From 2010-2014, Art of the Title facilitated and participated in the jury of the [[SXSW]] Excellence in Title Design Awards, part of the [[SXSW Film Festival]].

In 2013, Ian Albinson hosted a discussion at the title screening event, and then announced the winners at the Film Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Managing Editor Lola Landekic and Senior Editor Will Perkins gave a talk ahead of the Title Design Awards and hosted a discussion with filmmaker and designer Henry Hobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolmar | first = Jim | title = Title Design Awards and Art of the Title Discussion Announced | publisher = SXSW | date = February 20, 2014 | url = http://sxsw.com/film/news/2014/title-design-awards-and-art-title-discussion-announced | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In [[New York City]], Richie ([[Shawn Christensen]]), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill ([[Ron Perlman]]), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.

At his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie ([[Emmy Rossum]]), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia ([[Fátima Ptacek]]). Richie goes to her school, where she recites "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]" by [[Emily Dickinson]] in both English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.

Richie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for [[menopause]]. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.

Richie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon ([[Paul Wesley]]), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.

As a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham ([[Richard Schiff]]), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.

Richie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called "Sophia". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.

After Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren ([[Fran Kranz]]), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.

Having reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.

Maggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a "false idol". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "visually well mounted, but too overwrought to really convince or resonate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-before-i-disappear-1201136801/|title=SXSW Film Review: 'Before I Disappear'|last=Chang|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eric Kohn of [[Indiewire]] rated it B− and wrote that the film "contains all the strong moments that distinguished ''Curfew'' while surrounding them with a lot of superfluous additions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sxsw-review-oscar-nominated-short-film-receives-competent-feature-length-upgrade-with-before-i-disappear|title=SXSW Review: Oscar-Winning Short Film Receives Questionable Feature-Length Upgrade With 'Before I Disappear'|last=Kohn|first=Eric|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Adams of ''[[Screen Daily]]'' described it as "a stylish and beautifully shot adaptation, strong on performance and a nicely nuanced script, but in the end perhaps lacking an expanded story to suit its feature length."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/before-i-disappear/5068616.article|title=Before I Disappear|last=Adams|first=Mark|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote a negative review, in which he criticized the writing and flow of the film as being sporadic, but gave credit to the performances of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rooney | first = David | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/before-i-disappear-venice-review-728524 | title = 'Before I Disappear': Venice Review | date = August 27, 2014 | publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | accessdate = August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candoco Dance Company''' is a contemporary [[physically integrated dance]] company, founded in 1991 by [[Celeste Dandeker]] and Adam Benjamin. The company is based at the Aspire National training centre in [[Stanmore]], North London.&lt;ref name="Candoco-contact"/&gt;

==History==
Dandeker, who had previously trained with the [[London Contemporary Dance Theatre]], suffered a fall whilst dancing on stage.&lt;ref name="danceuk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt; The resulting spinal injury prevented her from dancing until choreographer [[Darshan Singh Bhuller]] persuaded her to dance again, albeit from her wheelchair, for the subsequently award-winning dance film ''The Fall''.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

Dandeker met Benjamin in 1990, they began teaching an integrated class from which grew the origins of Candoco Dance Company;  Dandeker and Benjamin were determined that they were not going to be a dance therapy group, disabled dancing or to be a modern freak show.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.communitydance.org.uk/DB/animated-library/a-compelling-combination?ed=14048|title=People Dancing - Foundation for Community Dance :: A compelling combination|website=www.communitydance.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that they would excel as dancers outlived their first few years when they won many awards. Some thought the awards were because they were the latest idea, but they continued to succeed. Dandekar was awarded a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1997.  The dancers that they started with stayed for eight years&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in 1999 she gave up dancing to concentrate on the artistic direction of CanDoCo.&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.candoco.co.uk/about-us/people/co-founders/celeste-dandeker-arnold-obe/|title=CELESTE DANDEKER-ARNOLD OBE - Candoco Dance Company|website=www.candoco.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dandehar retired in 2007. The role of artistic director was shared by Stine Nilsen and Pedro Machado for the next ten years with a new appointment made in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2017/stine-nilsen-and-pedro-machado-step-down-as-candoco-artistic-directors/|title=Stine Nilsen and Pedro Machado step down from Candoco|date=2017-01-05|work=The Stage|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertoire==
Benjamin choreographed much of the early companies work, leaving the company in 1998, and Dandeker went on to commission work by many established choreographers including Rafeal Bonachela, Fin Walker, [[Siobhan Davies]], Javier De Frutos, [[Stephen Petronio]] and Nigel Charnock amongst many others. Stine Nilsen and Pedro Machado succeeded in 2007 and they continued to commission choreographers including [[Javier de Frutos]], [[Claire Cunningham]] and [[Arlene Phillips]].

===2011 Restaging of Trisha Brown's Set and Reset===
For the 20th Anniversary the company restaged the seminal Set and Reset, choreographed by [[Trisha Brown]] in 1983. Retitled Set and Reset/Reset, this reworking reprocessed rather than replicated the original version. The piece was performed again in 2016, this time directed by [[Abigail Yager]] a former dancer with the [[Trisha Brown Dance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/17/cando-dance-company-review&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Paralympic Games and related performances===
In 2008 Candoco took part in the Handover Ceremonies at the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games, representing Britain. It was the first time disabled artists were present in both events in the history of the games.&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beijing"/&gt;

[[File:CaricaturePB.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the 2002 paperback edition of ''Caricature'']]
'''''Caricature''''' is a book collection of nine [[Comics|comic]] [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. In contrast to earlier Clowes collections such as ''Lout Rampage!'' and ''Orgy Bound'', ''Caricature'' concentrates on the more naturalistic, character-focused side of Clowes's output displayed in ''[[Ghost World]]''. It includes some of his most admired short stories, including "Immortal, Invisible", "Gynecology" and the title story. All the material in the collection originally appeared in Clowes's [[comic book]] ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]]'' with the exception of "Green Eyeliner", which was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

''Caricature'' was first published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1998 in a deluxe [[hardcover]] edition. A less expensive [[paperback]] version was released in 2002. Both editions contain a mixture of [[Color printing|full-color]] and [[black-and-white]] material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3276">The ''Chitrakathi'' is the name of an occupational caste whose traditional livelihood was to narrate stories aided with pictures sojourning various places.  
== History ==

The term ''Chitrakathi'' is the conjunction of two words: ''chitra'' meaning picture and ''katha'' meaning story. With this application, a Chitrakathi is the one who narrates stories with a visual aid. Thereby one can imagine the primitiveness of this art. In tribal's life there is a long-standing tradition of chitrakathi's paintings. Wall paintings of Saora, Gaund, Pradhan are extremely popular in India and abroad.  It’s an almost extinct art form practised by the Thakkar tribal community of Maharashtra. Chitrakathi artists are a community of migrating story tellers found all over Maharashra and some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They made a series of single sheets of paintings. All paintings belonging to one story were kept in a bundle called pothi. The Theme of Chitrakathi paintings include stories on local versions of Ramayana and [[Mahabharata]] and mythical themes. Use of brownish tones of stone colors gives a remarkable effect. Figures in paintings were generally stylized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gottesbild.com/blog/?p=1315|title=Chitrakathi Paintings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

"Chitra" means picture and "katha" means story and the exponent called Chitrakathi is the person who narrates the story with the aid of some visual support. "Broadly speaking,Chitrakatha is identified in three forms, Leather shadow puppets, Stringed wooden puppets and Picture stories. The latter only, now, is identified as 'Chitrakathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists use the term "Pothi" to set of pictures which contains 30 to 50 pages arranged in chronological order. These pages are unbound like pages of Ramayana and Mahabharata previously one artist used to keep 40 to 50 Pothis but today fortunately 15 to 20 Pothis are in good condition. Some pothis date back to 300 years whereas some 50 to 60 years old. The art of story telling may become extinct in less than a decade and half unless effective steps are taken by the government to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkanonline.com/art/chitrakathi.html|title=Chitrakathi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists and awards ==

Some prominent Chitrakathi artists are Jayashree Patankar, Alaka Bhandiwad, Indira Seshadri, Meenakshi Madan, Rajasri Manikandan, V Shanmughapriya, Shoba Rajagopalan, S Suresh and Vaishnavi Srikanth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/02/stories/2003010200840300.htm|title=Impressions of myth and nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

[[File:France, Paris, la statue de Jeanne d'Arc à la Place des Pyramides.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeanne d'Arc (Frémiet)|Jeanne d'Arc]]'' statue at [[Place des Pyramides]], Paris by [[Emmanuel Frémiet]], 1874]]
[[Joan of Arc]] ([[Jeanne d'Arc]] in French) has inspired artistic and cultural works for nearly six centuries.  The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture.  The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog.  Lesser known works, particularly from early periods, are not included.
In this article, many of the excluded items are derivative of better known representations.  For instance, [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] play inspired at least 82 different dramatic works during the nineteenth century, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] operatic adaptations are still recorded and performed.  Most of the others survive only in research libraries.{{Ref|adaptations}}  As another example, in 1894, Émile Huet listed over 400 plays and musical works about Joan of Arc.  Despite a great deal of scholarly interest in Joan of Arc no complete list of artistic works about her exists, although a 1989 doctoral dissertation did identify all relevant films including ones for which [[Lost film|no copy survives]].{{Ref|lists}}

Portrayals of Joan of Arc are numerous.  For example, in 1979 the ''Bibliothèque Municipale'' in [[Rouen]], France displayed a gallery containing over 500 images and other items related to Joan of Arc.{{Ref|Rouen}}
The story of Joan of Arc was a popular subject for dramatization in the 1940s. &lt;!-- (Perhaps this was due to World War II and the appeal of the subject of driving invaders from one's country.)--&gt; In addition to Maxwell Anderson's play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'' and the [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'', there was also the 1948 RKO film ''[[The Miracle of the Bells]]'' starring [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Alida Valli]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], about a dying film actress whose first and last role is Joan of Arc. There were also three radio dramatizations of the story of Joan during those years, one of them specifically written with a World War II framework.

==Organization of this article==
For purposes of classification, popular culture music is a separate section from [[opera]]s and [[oratorio]]s. [[Film]]s include made-for-television movies and [[miniseries]].  Television covers live action series.

|Anonymous (possibly Jacques Millet)
|First performed in [[Orleans]] four years after Joan's death. The surviving version appears to be a revision from circa 1450. God and several saints play major roles in this sprawling drama with more than 100 speaking parts.

|''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]''
|[[Friedrich Schiller]]
|In literary rebuttal to Voltaire, Schiller creates a sympathetic Joan as a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] heroine. A magic helmet renders her invincible until she falls in love, and is killed in battle rather than being burned at the stake. This drama was the basis of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera of the same name.

|''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc''
|[[Thérèse of Lisieux]]
|The first of two 'pious recreations' written by the Saint; "small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days." Performed at the Carmel on January 21, 1894, it featured Thérèse in the title role. The script, which focuses more heavily upon Joan's interaction with her visions, has since been widely circulated with Saint Thérèse's writings, as has that of its sequel.
|- valign="top"
|1895
|''Jeanne d'Arc Accomplit Sa Mission''
|[[Thérèse of Lisieux]]
|Sequel to ''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc'', this was performed exactly one year later, January 21, 1895. Again featuring Thérèse as Joan, its focus is upon her martyrdom. In the estimation of Thérèse's biographer, Ida Görres, the two plays "are scarcely veiled self-portraits."

|''[[Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc]]''
|[[Mark Twain]]
|This work is little remembered yet in Mark Twain's own opinion was his finest work.  Twain spent months in France researching newly rediscovered documents and years of research overall.  This reverent fictional biography is Twain's most uncharacteristic novel.

In this revised version, Joan looks back over her life in a series of danced dialogues with her guiding spirit, [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]], and with three figures who represent different aspects of her nature: maid, warrior, and martyr. At the work's close, the transfigured Joan takes her place among the saints. [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100455601]

|''The Image of the Beast''
|[[Philip José Farmer]]
|Joan of Arc is portrayed as an alien sexual predator, still alive in the 20th century but with her body altered to enable the also-alien 15th-century [[serial killer]] [[Gilles de Rais]] to live within her [[vagina dentata]] as a fang-toothed venomous snake that bites and paralyses men during intercourse.

| The young girl is kneeling, doubtless in a chateau, because the ground is not the beaten earth of the houses of the era but a green and black tile-flooring. She is dressed in grey, with high hose, an attire of a man. Thence to think that it has to do with the departure from Vaucouleurs or arrival at Chinon, there is not but to take a step; to prove it is another thing.

| "helmeted head of a statue"
|
| ''Musée Historique et Archeologique'', Orléans
| The head of a statue, discovered in 1820 in the ruins of the Church of Saint-Maurice, Orléans, long considered to have been modelled after the likeness of Joan of Arc.&lt;ref&gt;

Edmunds (2008:[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9maU4D-QLUC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 40f.]) portrays the possibility of the head representing Jeanne d'Arc as plausible, citing enthusiastic support from [[Walter Scott]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and claims a "a tradition than when Joan entered Orléans in triumph after the siege was raised a sculptor modelled the head of his statue of St Maurice from Joan herself".
The head was discovered in the ruins of the demolished church in 1820, and the "tradition" is in fact limited to learned 19th-century speculation. 20th-century art historians tend to identify the head as belonging to a statue of [[Saint George]]. "Tête casquée découverte en 1820 dans les démolitions des restes de l'ancienne église Saint-Eloi-Saint-Maurice, considérée parfois, mais à tort, comme représentant Jeanne d'Arc; c'est en réalité une tête de St Georges."  Val de Loire; Maine, Orléanais, Touraine, Anjou, Hachette (1963), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan of Arc's short haircut had a profound effect on women's hairstyles in the twentieth century.  In 1909, the Paris hairdresser Antoine took Joan of Arc as the inspiration for the [[Bob cut|bob]], which ended centuries of taboo against women who cut their hair.  The style became popular in the 1920s and was associated with [[Sexual liberation|liberated women]].  Nearly all subsequent Western hair fashions are designed for women who cut their hair at least occasionally. Such haircut is still known in French as ''coupe à la Jeanne d'Arc'' (Joan of Arc's haircut).

During the [[Cristero War]] in 1927, a group of female Cristeros named themselves after Joan of Arc.  They obtained money, supplies, and intelligence for the male combatants.  They often smuggled weapons into war zones and cared for the wounded.  By the end of the war they had 35,000 participants.

Several people have been seen as modern versions of Joan of Arc:

'''''The Dort''''', or '''''Dort or Dordrecht: The Dort packet-boat from Rotterdam becalmed''''' is an 1818 painting by [[J M W Turner]], based on drawings made by him in mid September 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Martin, and Evelyn Joll. ''The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner''. New Haven: Published for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art and the Tate Gallery by Yale UP, 1984. 103. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a view of the harbour of [[Dordrecht]]. It is the finest example of the influence of Dutch marine painting on Turner's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3668719/Art-sales-The-man-who-saved-British-art.html|title=Art sales: The man who saved British art|author=Colin Gleadell|date=23 October 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1818, where it was described by ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' as "one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited, and does honour to the age". In 1832, [[John Constable]] wrote of the picture, "I remember most of Turner's early works; amongst them one of singular intricacy and beauty; it was a canal with numerous boats making thousands of beautiful shapes, and I think the most complete work of a genius I ever saw".

It was purchased by [[Walter Fawkes]] for 500 guineas at the request of his son, and hung in the drawing room at [[Farnley Hall, North Yorkshire|Farnley Hall]] until it was bought by [[Paul Mellon]] in 1966. It was then donated to the [[Yale Center for British Art]] upon the founding of the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1667701|title=Dort or Dordrecht: The Dort packet-boat from Rotterdam becalmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Solomon photo.jpg|thumb|Edward Solomon]]
'''Edward Solomon''' (25 July 1855 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1895) was an English composer, as well as a conductor, orchestrator and pianist. He died at age 39 by which time he had written dozens of works produced for the stage, including several for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], including ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'' (1891). Early in his career, he was a frequent collaborator of [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]].  He had a bigamous marriage with [[Lillian Russell]] in the 1880s.

==Life and career==
Edward ("Teddy") Solomon was born in [[Lambeth]], London, to a Jewish family. He had ten siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobsuniverse.com/BOW/Books/Bergh-Opera-4/Bergh-4-23.htm Profile of Solomon at the Opera World site]&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Charles Solomon (1817–1890), a [[music hall]]  pianist, conductor and composer, and his wife, Cesira "Sarah" Marinina, née Mirandoli (1834–1891). He picked up music by working with his father.

Aged 17 or 18, Solomon married 15-year-old Jane Isaacs in 1873, and the two had a daughter, Claire Romaine (1873–1964), who became an actress, but Solomon soon deserted Isaacs and, over the years, took a series of mistresses. Isaacs later sang under the stage name Lily Grey.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Tomes, Jason. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53516 Edward Solomon], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, October 2007; accessed 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
His first [[comic opera]] was ''A Will With a Vengeance'' (1876), a one-act work with a libretto by Frederick Hay, based on ''La Vendetta''.  This was produced at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].  In 1879, he met [[Henry Pottinger Stephens|Henry Pottinger "Pot" Stephens]] while he was the musical director at the [[Royalty Theatre]] conducting, among other works, [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Zoo]]''.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/S/SolomonEdward.htmn Edward Solomon], ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte'', 17 February 2002; accessed 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  With Stephens, he produced his first successes, ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' (1880), a "nautical comedy opera" in two acts; and ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' (1881, celebrating a well known 18th century highwayman),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/09/11/102758235.pdf Review of ''Claude Duval'']&lt;/ref&gt; both of which remained popular for many years in both the UK and US.  Other Solomon and Stephens pieces were ''Lord Bateman, or Picotee's Pledge'' (1882), ''Virginia and Paul, or Ringing the Changes'' (1883)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=sZkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22edward+solomon%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dxhgHYMd_V&amp;sig=bvKnaXM2mjGWwEgZcGcX0n8BiBg Libretto to ''Virginia'']&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''[[The Red Hussar]]'' (1889), a "comedy opera" in three acts.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; Together, they would also write ''Popsy Wopsy'', a "musical absurdity" (1880) and ''Pocahontas'' (1884).

Solomon also wrote the music for the short companion pieces ''[[Quite an Adventure]]'' (1881; [[Olympic Theatre]]; revived in 1894 at the [[Savoy Theatre]]) and ''Round and Square'' (1885), each with a libretto by [[Frank Desprez]], and each produced on tour by D'Oyly Carte companies in the 1880s and 1890s.  Other early shows included ''Love and Larceny'' in 1881, a farce, ''Through the Looking-Glass'' (1882), ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', a [[comic opera]] with a libretto by [[Sydney Grundy]] (1882; revived 1892 at the Savoy),&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 23 July  1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the successful ''Polly, or The Pet of the Regiment'' (1884) and ''[[Pepita; or, the Girl with the Glass Eyes]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Deshler.

For instance, he arranged [[George Grossmith]]'s "See Me Dance the Polka" for piano.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Later career===
[[File:Carte-solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Solomon (r) with [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], 1891]]
With [[F. C. Burnand]], Solomon wrote ''Pickwick'' (1889), which also had a run in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Domestic Economy'' (1890), and "The Tiger" (1890).  Burnand's contribution to the last of these was so unacceptable that the work was hissed off the stage on its opening night.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn. "The Nautch Girl", article in centenary book for ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]''. Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, 1992, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David. [http://www.retrospectopera.org.uk/CD_catalogue.html "''Pickwick'' by Burnand &amp; Solomon and ''Cups and Saucers'' by George Grossmith"],  Retrospect Opera, 2016, accessed 13 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1891-93, after [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] had temporarily separated, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] mounted a number of non-G&amp;S pieces to keep the [[Savoy Theatre]] open, including a revival of ''The Vicar of Bray'' in 1892.  Solomon's most famous work produced by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] was probably ''[[The Nautch Girl]] or, The Rajah of Chutneypore'' (1891), an "Indian comic opera" in two acts with a libretto by [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], and lyrics by Dance and [[Frank Desprez]]. It initially ran for 200 performances at the [[Savoy Theatre]] and then toured. The company also toured ''The Vicar of Bray''.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

His last stage work was ''On the March'' (1896), a musical comedy in two acts, with John Crook and [[Frederic Clay]], to a libretto by [[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]], [[B. C. Stephenson]] and Cecil Clay, based on ''In Camp'' by Victoria Vokes.

===Bigamous marriage and personal information===
Solomon has been described as "a diminutive clean-shaven young man ... whimsical, flamboyant, superstitious, hardly to be trusted with money or women, but brimming with melodic invention and able to compose at speed."&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He met the American actress [[Lillian Russell]], in 1882 at [[Tony Pastor]]'s New York Casino Theatre where he was the season's musical director and she became the star. Unaware of his first marriage she became his mistress. Subsequently, they sailed together to London, where she starred in several of his works, written specifically for her, including ''Virginia'', ''Billee Taylor'', ''Polly'' and ''Pocahontas''.  These were not highly successful in Britain, so they returned to America, where Russell was very well received in these works. They had a daughter together, Dorothy, in 1884, and married in New Jersey in 1885. The relationship soured, mostly due to Solomon's poor finances, and their last show, ''The Maid and the Moonshiner'' (1886) was a flop. When creditors sued Solomon, he fled the country.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Solomon was arrested in London in 1886 for bigamy, but the case against him collapsed, as no American witnesses came forward. When she learned of his previous marriage, Russell sued for divorce, finally obtaining it in 1893.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valentinetheatre.com/mural/bios/Lillian_Russell.html "Lillian Russell"], Valentine Theatre, accessed 16 July 2014; Bergh, Albert Ellery. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ProvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA173 ''Drama and Opera: The opera''], Athenian society (1909), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Solomon's first wife divorced him in 1887.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1889 he married an actress, Kate Everleigh. His brother Frederick Solomon sang in ''Billee Taylor'' in the provinces (1883) and was the composer of the comic opera ''Captain Kidd, or The Bold Buccaneer,'' produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, [[Liverpool]], on 10 September 1883.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Solomon died in London of typhoid fever in 1895 at the age of 39.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

The '''flag of Georgia''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: საქართველოს სახელმწიფო დროშა; ''sakartvelos sakhelmtsʼipo drosha''), also known as the '''Five Cross Flag''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ხუთჯვრიანი დროშა; ''khutjvriani drosha''), is one of the [[national symbol]]s of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Originally a [[banner]] of the [[medieval]] [[Kingdom of Georgia]], it was brought back to popular use in the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|21st centuries]] during periods of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Georgian national revival]]. Prior to obtaining its official status in 2004, the flag was popularized by the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] and served as one of the most recognizable symbols of the [[Rose Revolution]]. 

== History==
The current flag was used by the Georgian patriotic movement following the country's independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. By the late 1990s, the design had become widely known as the Georgian historical national flag as [[Vexillology|vexillologist]]s had pointed out the red-on-white [[Jerusalem cross]] shown as the flag of [[Tbilisi]] in a 14th-century map by [[Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano]].&lt;ref&gt;"The new flag of Georgia does not seem to be related with this historical banner. The flag of the National Movement was unknown ten years ago [1993] and was called 'the Georgian historical national flag' by the opposition leaders only after publications by the Georgian vexillologist I.L. Bichikashvili." Mikhail Revnivtsev, 25 November 2003 [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ge.html crwflags.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of Georgians, including the influential [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos-Patriarch]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], supported the restoration of the flag and in 1999 the [[Parliament of Georgia]] passed a bill to change the flag. However, it was not endorsed by the [[President of Georgia|President]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. It was adopted in the early 2000s by the main opposition party, the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], as a symbol of popular resistance to Shevardnadze's rule.&lt;ref&gt;"A majority of Georgians, including the patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, have long favored adopting the five-cross banner as the nation's official flag.  But the outgoing president stymied all efforts to make the change. In 1999, the Georgian Parliament voted to change the flag, and all Shevardnadze had to do was issue a supportive Decree. Inexplicably, he refused to do so, instead setting up a powerless Heraldic Commission to study the matter. When Saakashvili founded the National Movement in 2001, therefore, the five-cross flag was the natural choice to illustrate his party's populist bent." Brendan Koerner, "[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/11/whats_with_georgias_flags.html What's With Georgia's Flags?]", ''Slate'', 25 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was adopted by Parliament on 14 January 2004.&lt;ref name='agenda' /&gt; Saakashvili formally endorsed it via Presidential Decree No. 31 signed on 25 January,&lt;ref&gt;[https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/34906 Presidential Decree 31]{{link language|ka}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his election as President. 14 January is annually marked as a [[Flag Day]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name='agenda'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/73182/eng|title=Georgia celebrates National Flag Day today|publisher=Agenda.ge|date=14 Jan 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The national flag of Georgia, as described in the decree:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Georgian national flag is a white rectangle, with in its central portion a large red cross touching all four sides of the flag. In the four corners there are four ''[[Bolnisi cross|bolnur-katskhuri]]'' crosses (Also refer as Georgian Crosses aside with [[Grapevine cross]]) of the same colour (as the large cross).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Georgian States===
The first Georgian flag design came about during the era of the early Georgian state, the [[Principality of Iberia]] which had a red cross against a white background, similar to the [[flag of England]]).
The subsequent [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti]], shared this same flag. The flag of the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] had 4 green strips in a dextral position on the right side, while the left side contained the cross seen on the current Georgian flag.

According to D.

===Collapse of Kingdom of Georgia===
After the collapse of the Kingdom of Georgia, its successor states adopted their own flags, with most of them using animals as their representative symbols.

===Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (1762–1801)===
The kingdom was formed through the unification of Kartli and Kakheti. The flag had a white cross against a black background. The country lost its independence in 1801 to annexation by the [[Russian Empire]].

===Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (1918)===
While not technically a Georgian flag, this flag is of importance as Georgia was one of the founding countries of the federation. The [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]'s flag was a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] design, with a top band of dark yellow, a middle band of black, and a bottom band of red.

===Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921)===
During Georgia's brief existence as an independent state as the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] from 1918 to 1921, a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] was adopted. The design resulted from a national flag-designing contest won by the painter [[Iakob Nikoladze]]. It was abolished by the [[Soviet Union]] following the 1921 incorporation of Georgia into the USSR.

=== Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1991) ===
{{Main|Flag of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
During the Soviet period, Georgia adopted several variants of the [[flag of the Soviet Union|red Soviet flag]] incorporating either the [[Georgian SSR|Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic's]] name, or a red [[hammer and sickle]] with a [[red star|star]] in a blue sun in the [[flag terminology|canton]] and a blue bar in the upper part of flag. The flag of the [[Flag of Georgian SSR|Georgian SSR]] was abolished by the Georgian government in November 1990 shortly before it declared independence from the Soviet Union.

===Georgia (1991–2004)===
The previous flag used by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 was revived on 8 December 1991, by the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia]]. However, it lost popularity thereafter as it became associated with the chaotic and violent period around the collapse of the Soviet Union. The wine-red colour symbolises the good times in the past and the future, while the black represents Russian rule, and the white represents hope for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Luck, ed.|year=1997|title=Oxford Family Encyclopedia (first ed.).

The '''Flag of [[Melbourne]]''' is the official flag for the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It was based on the design of the arms component of the [[coat of arms of Melbourne]], which in turn was based on the 1848 common seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne Day - About our day|url=http://www.melbourneday.com.au/about.html|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag features a white background divided into four quadrants by the red cross of [[Saint George]], patron saint of England. On both sides of each arm of the cross are narrow red bars known as a cotise. In the centre there is a Royal Crown, signifying the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarchy]].

The four quadrants divided by the cross each feature a design representing an important sector of Melbourne's economy in the mid 19th century. The designs are:
* a [[Wool|fleece]] hanging from a red ring, representing the wool industry;
* a black bull standing on a hillock, representing the cattle industry;
* a three masted [[tall ship]] in full sail at  sea, representing trade and shipping;
* a spouting [[whale]] at sea, representing the whaling industry.

The Melbourne Flag is flown at various places, including: [[Melbourne Town Hall]]; on the Lord Mayor of Melbourne's car; at Enterprize Park, the location where the settlement began; and on the replica of tall ship [[Enterprize Replica|Enterprize]].

'''Footnote New Zealand Dance''' (founded in 1985) is New Zealand's oldest contemporary dance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swarbrick|first1=Nancy|title=Creative life - Performing arts|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/creative-life/page-8|website=Te Ara - Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Wellington]], it has been described as "New Zealand’s most enduring and influential contemporary dance company."&lt;ref name ='Horsley'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horsley|first1=Francesca|title=Interview: Deirdre Tarrant on retiring from Footnote Dance Company|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/culture/arts/dance/interview-deirdre-tarrant/|website=New Zealand Listener|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

'''''For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] dramatizing a hundred years of American [[film criticism]] through film clips, historic photographs, and on-camera interviews with many of today’s important reviewers, mostly print but also Internet. It was produced by Amy Geller, written and directed by long-time [[Boston Phoenix]] film critic [[Gerald Peary]], and narrated by [[Patricia Clarkson]]. Critics featured include [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', and [[Elvis Mitchell]], host of the [[KCRW|public radio show]] ''The Treatment''.

Many more critics, journalists, and writers from the present and past appear in film clips and interviews. Among them: [[Jami Bernard]], [[Manny Farber]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Molly Haskell]], [[J. Hoberman]], [[Harlan Jacobson]], [[Stanley Kauffmann]], [[Stuart Klawans]], [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Janet Maslin]], [[Wesley Morris]], [[Rex Reed]], [[B. Ruby Rich]], [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Richard Schickel]], [[David Sterritt]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Richard Corliss]], and [[Gene Siskel]].

Other figures from film history appear in photographs and include [[Vincent Canby]], [[Bosley Crowther]], [[James Agee]], [[Otis Ferguson]], [[Vachel Lindsay]], and [[Frank E. Woods]].

Bringing the history of film criticism up to the present, the film introduces internet-based critics [[Harry Knowles]] of ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' and [[Karina Longworth]], who wrote at the time for ''spout.com''.

==Theme==
Gerald Peary says, "''For the Love of Movies'' is the first feature documentary to tell the rich, colorful, and undeniably controversial story of the American film critic ... I had to sort of invent what I think is the history of film criticism, because there wasn’t any formally written book on it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/today/node/7812 Gerald Peary interview] by Robin Berghaus of ''[[BU Today]]'', 12 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to difficulties in getting financial backing, the documentary took nearly a decade to make.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/movies/homevideo/30kehr.html?_r=1 For the Love of Movies, DVD release] [[New York Times]], 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Peary says, "I guess one of the things that happened during that period was the so-called decline of print journalism ... eight years ago, film criticism still seemed a viable profession ... by now, there are over fifty critics who are ''made redundant''"&lt;ref name=cairns&gt;[https://dcairns.wordpress.com/tag/for-the-love-of-movies/ Edinburgh International Film Festival: Interview with Gerald Peary] by [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] of ''Shadowplay'', 28 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker Magazine asks:  What is the crisis of criticism? Gerald Peary replies:  Simply that if you are a print critic you are in danger of losing your job at any moment. As newspapers are worried about dropping dead, it seems like film critics are a particular target. The film begins by saying, "There are 24 critics who have lost their jobs in the last several years," but since we finished the film, many more have lost their jobs. A lot of people are tagged with a title of ''ex-critic'', but they were not ''ex'' when we filmed them just a few years ago. Sure, you can work on the web, but if you do that you're not getting paid much, or at all. And critics should be paid — this isn't an amateur thing to do, it's not like Sunday painting.&lt;ref name=macaulay&gt;[http://filmmakermagazine.com/news/2009/03/for-the-love-of-movies-gerald-peary-by-alicia-van-couvering/ Interview with Gerald Peary] by Scott Macaulay of [[Filmmaker (magazine)|''Filmmaker'' Magazine]], 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's a stop-the-bleeding movie," Peary tells [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]. "I hope that those who watch the movie value criticism and will read it and demand it in their newspapers."&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;[http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2009/04/swsw-american-critics.html review] by Anne Thompson  of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], 08 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Peary laments, "Today, people select which movies to see based on advertising. Lots of excellent little pictures — foreign, independent, and documentaries — are passing through without being seen. The only way to get people to go to those films, because they have no advertising budgets, is reviews by good critics ... We want people to read criticism. One way to motivate people to do that is by showing the critics’ faces and letting their voices be heard."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/today/node/9469 Movie Love] by Robin Berghaus of BU Today, 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
* Scott Macaulay: "''For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism'' is a tender and detailed documentary spanning the art form’s beginnings, middle, present and future."&lt;ref name=macaulay/&gt;
* Victoria Large: "Peary has wisely determined that the best defense of film criticism is, well, film criticism itself. In addition to archive footage and lively interviews, he includes voice-over readings of excerpts of film reviews past, lively passages that remind us that great critics have to be great writers, astute observers and thinkers who are skilled in expressing themselves."&lt;ref name=large&gt;[http://notcoming.com/reviews/fortheloveofmovies/ Interview with Gerald Peary] by Victoria Large of ''[[Not Coming to a Theater Near You]]'', 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Guillen:  "Gerald Peary sharply evaluates the history of critical-analytical writing on moving pictures in this stimulating tour through the rise, fall and reorientation of film criticism in the United States ... a smart look at key figures and how they've changed public consciousness of both the movies and criticism itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theeveningclass.blogspot.com/2009/04/sfiff52-for-love-of-movies-story-of.html review] by Michael Guillen of the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle]], 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Ebert]]: "I enjoyed it immensely, I learned a lot. Very well done, edited, researched — and narrated!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/flm.html review], at ''Bullfrog Films'', 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eugene Hernandez:  "Peary spent nearly a decade making ''For the Love of Movies'', working with producer Amy Geller to examine the history and future of film criticism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/article/eugene_hernandez_for_the_love_of_movies/# review] by Eugene Hernandez of ''[[indieWIRE]]'', 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]]:  "Thus the film, which offers an excellent history of American film criticism, also serves as a valentine to a vanishing profession, something Peary could never have foreseen ... It's hard not to feel sad at the end of this movie, about a world that no longer exists, a profession that seems to be dying in front of our eyes."&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;
* [[David Bordwell]]:  "It’s a lively and thoughtful survey, interspersing interviews with contemporary critics with a chronological account that runs from Frank E. Woods to Harry Knowles ... ''For the Love of Movies'' offers a concise, entertaining account of mass-market movie criticism, and I think a lot of universities would want to use it in film and journalism courses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=4102 essay] by [[Kristin Thompson]] and David Bordwell of David Bordwell's ''Website on Cinema'', 03 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ty Burr]]:  "...this is a meal no one has ever cooked before: an affectionate, knowledgeable overview of film criticism from the silent era to the Internet ... the movie’s a lively and important first step in assaying the worth of a field on the verge of extinction, as more and more professional reviewers are let go from struggling news organizations (nearly 60 in the past 3 1/2 years)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/09/09/an_insider_looks_at_film_criticism_through_the_years/ review] by Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 09 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chris Faraone:  "... Peary incinerates the barrier between subject and reporter, demonstrating more than mere comprehension of the art he's scrutinized for decades ... his larger challenge was to assemble a story that would entertain not just critics but those pedestrians who don’t know Cinéaste from bouillabaisse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Movies/89032-Love-letter/ review] by Chris Faraone of ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'', 03 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeffrey Wells:  "''For The Love of Movies''…is finally here and it does the job nicely. Which is to say intelligently, competently, lovingly and, after a fashion, comprehensively ... It's a hell of a subject — a chronicle of magnificent obsessions and magnificent dreams, and a rise-and-fall story covering scores of critics, the entirety of the Hollywood film culture from the '20s to the present, and hundreds if not thousands of movies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2009/03/those_were_the.php review] by Jeffrey Wells of ''Hollywood Elsewhere'', 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chale Nafus:  "Gerald Peary’s seminal cinematic exploration of the wealth of American film criticism provides a wonderful roadmap of where we have been and observes the many directions the whole endeavor is now moving."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persistenceofvision.org/2010/01/for-the-love-of-movies-the-story-of-american-film-criticism-a-documentary-by-gerald-peary/ review] by Chale Nafus of the ''Journal of the Austin Film Society'', 01 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''’s [[Joe Leydon]] argued that for "all its attempts to offer an expansive and exhaustive historical account, the docu is riddled with glaring gaps and facile transitions. Some notables are extremely conspicuous by their absence. Inexplicably, there’s absolutely no mention of [[Judith Crist]], even though her prominent outlets — ''[[The Today Show]]'', ''[[New York magazine]]'', and ''[[TV Guide]]'' — made her, arguably, the most widely known U.S. critic in the 1960s and early ‘70s."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/for-the-love-of-movies-the-story-of-american-film-criticism-1200473987/ review] by Joe Leydon of ''Variety'', 27 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5887">'''Frederic King''' (1853 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1933) was a [[baritone]] best known for his performances in the works composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]] for the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festivals]] of 1880 and 1886.  Later, he taught singing for 42 years at the [[Royal College of Music]].

==Early life and concert career==
Born in [[Lichfield]], the son of Thomas and Mary King, Frederic King was baptised on 13 January 1853 at St Michael's church in Lichfield. He worked in an [[Auction|auction house]] before joining the concert agents Messrs Harrison. He made his professional debut in a ballad concert at [[St James's Hall]] in 1878 and launched a successful career as a platform singer in [[baritone]] roles. He married Eva Hume (born 1863) in London in 1882, and they had two children, Mary Eva Oakley King (1883–1955) and Ernest Archibald Frederic King (1888–1973).&lt;ref&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/60506390/person/30060227005 Marriage of Frederic King and Eva Hume in 1882 - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt;

King created the role of Callias, the Priest of [[Apollo]], in the first performance of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[oratorio]] ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' at the triennial [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festivals]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/4890 Leeds Musical Festival Concert Programmes (1858–89)], Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He sang the role of [[Mephistopheles]] in the English premiere of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'' at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Straits/&gt; In 1886, at Leeds, he sang the role of [[Lucifer]] in the first performance of Sullivan's [[cantata]] ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/4891 Leeds Musical Festival Concert Programmes (1886, 1901, 1907)], Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing King's performance in the latter work, [[Herman Klein]], in ''Musical Notes'', called him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a talented and conscientious artist, who invested his music with all the dramatic significance and sardonic humour of which it was susceptible. Truth to tell, there is not much diabolical in Longfellow's fiend, and it would seem as though Sir Arthur Sullivan had sought on occasion to atone for his comparative mildness by applying a background of orchestration worthy in its sonority of Berlioz or Wagner. Whether Satan could make himself heard in Pandemonium may be an open question, but undoubtedly there are moments in ''The Golden Legend'' when Lucifer's human representative, be his voice ever so stentorian, is bound to be inaudible. All that artistic singing could do to lend the character its proper prominence was done by Mr. King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/Musical_Notes_1000042273/93 Klein, Herman]. ''Musical Notes'' (1887) Reprint. London: Forgotten Books (2013), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later years==
On retiring from the concert platform King taught singing at the [[Royal College of Music]] for 42 years, from 1889 to 1931. Among his students were [[Norman Allin]], [[Miriam Licette]], [[Robert Radford]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/hooey/radford-bio.htm Robert Radford], Music Web International website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/artists/robert-radford/ Robert Radford biography], [[MTV]] website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brazell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-BRAZ-DAV-1875.html David Brazell], [[Welsh Biography Online]], accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Samuell]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgYZqFWbe0oC&amp;pg=PA275 Williams, Gordon ''British Theatre in the Great War: A Revaluation''], Continuum (2005) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Heyner]]. After his retirement from the Royal Academy of Music he continued to give lessons privately, the last being just before he was taken ill a week before his death.&lt;ref name=Straits/&gt;

King died in May 1933 aged 80 at his home in [[Hampstead]] after a short illness.&lt;ref name=Straits&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19330606-1.2.128.aspx 'Mr F.

'''Gruppe 47''' (Group 47) was a group of participants in German writers' meetings, invited by [[Hans Werner Richter]] between 1947-1967.&lt;ref&gt;Kaube, Jürgen. "[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/autoren/schriftsteller-peter-handke-bei-gruppe-47-in-princeton-14191769.html Literatur? Alles Läppisch]". ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', 22 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings served the dual goals of literary criticism as well as the promotion of young, unknown authors. In a democratic vote titled "Preis der Gruppe 47" (Prize of Group 47), it proved to be excellent for many who were beginning their writing careers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arnold, Heinz Ludwig. "[http://www.bpb.de/apuz/30413/aufstieg-und-ende-der-gruppe-47?p=all Aufstieg und Ende der Gruppe 47]". ''Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung'', 6 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Group 47 had no organizational form, no fixed membership list, and no literary program, but was strongly influenced by Richter's invitations.

In its early days, Gruppe 47 offered young writers a platform for the renewal of [[German literature]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; after [[World War II]]. It later became an influential [[institution]] in the cultural life of the [[Deutschland|Federal Republic of Germany]], as important contemporary writers and [[Literary criticism|literary critics]] participated in the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Wecker, Angelika. "[https://www.uni-ulm.de/LiLL/senior-info-mobil/module/Lit47.htm Die Gruppe 47]". Universität Ulm.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural and political influence of Group 47 has been the subject of numerous debates. Even after the end of their meetings in 1967, former participants of the group remained influential in the development of German-language literature.

==Early history==

=== Background of ''Der Ruf'' ===
In the spring of 1945, ''[[Der Ruf (newspaper)|Der Ruf: Zeitung der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen'' (''The Call: Newspaper of German War Prisoners)]]'' was begun in a Rhode Island POW camp, Fort Philip Kearny, as part of American re-education for German POWs. It was edited by Curt Vinz, working with Alfred Andersch and Hans Werner Richter. Upon their return to Germany they planned to publish a successor magazine under the title ''Der Ruf – unabhängige Blätter der jungen Generation'' (''The Call - Independent paper of the Younger Generation''), which first appeared on the 15th of August, 1946. The magazine printed from literary texts, but the publishers (Andersch and Richter) understood it was primarily a political body, in which they argued for a free Germany as a bridge between East and West. They were also critical of the American occupation forces, which led to the prohibition of the April 1947 ''Ruf'' by the Information Control Division of the American Occupation Zone. After the dismissal of the editor, the magazine reappeared with a new political orientation, headed by Erich Kuby. However, it had lost its importance and was finally discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Böttiger, Helmut. "Die Gruppe 47" in ''Als die deutsche Literatur Geschichte schrieb''. München: Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 2012, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Ruf'' ceased publication, Hans Werner Richter began to plan a successor magazine, which he wanted to dub ''Der Skorpion'' (''The Scorpion''). On the 6th and 7 September in 1947, Richter held an editorial meeting with authors from the area of the planned newspaper in Ilse Schneider-Lengyel’s house, on Bannwaldsee, near Füssen. Their manuscripts were read and discussed together, as well as the private purpose of the future magazine. While ''Der Skorpion'' was never actually published, the first meeting of Gruppe 47 was developed from this meeting near Bannwaldsee. With regard to the group’s history, Richter later explained: "The origin of Group 47 was of a political-journalistic nature. They did not create literati, but politically committed journalist with literary ambitions."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Richter (ed.): ''Almanach der Gruppe 47''. 1947–1962. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical periodization ===
Friedhelm Kröll divided the history of Group 47 into four periods:
# Constitutional period 1947-49,
# Ascent period 1950-57,
# High period 1958-63,
# Late and Decay Period 1964-67.&lt;ref&gt;Kröll, Friedhelm. ''Gruppe 47''. Stuttgart: Metzler, 1979, p. 26ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and organization ===
At the meeting at Bannwaldsee, 16 participants took part. To begin, [[Wolfdietrich Schnurre]] read his short story Das Begräbnis (The Funeral). After this, the other participants expressed open, partly sharp, spontaneous criticism, which was to become the later ritual of group criticism. This form of literary criticism, in which the speaker author always sat on the empty seat next to Richter, jokingly dubbed the "electric chair", remained the form of discussion for Group 47’s entire existence. The important maxim was that the lecturer was not allowed to defend himself, and that the review of a specific text was the focus of the meeting. Political discussions of literary or political nature, on which the group could have split, were consistently deferred to Richter. Despite the group’s preference for realistic Trümmerliteratur (rubble literature), there was no official literary program of the group, no common poetics and only a few principles about not allowing fascist or militarist texts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Blakemore, Erin. "[https://daily.jstor.org/gruppe-47-group-made-gunter-grass/ Gruppe 47: The Group That Made Günter Grass]". ''JSTOR Daily''. 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Gruppe 47 emerged only after the first meeting, as Hans Werner Richter was planning to repeat the event regularly. The author and critic Hans Georg Brenner suggested the name, associating the group with the Spanish Generación del 98 (Generation of '98) before. Richter, who rejected any organizational form of the meetings, whether "club, association, or academy" agreed with the proposal, saying "‘Group 47’ - that is without obligation and actually says nothing."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It was only in 1962, on the 15th anniversary of the group’s birth, that Richter formulated retrospectively the "idealistic starting points" of Gruppe 47:
# "Democratic elite education in the field of literature and journalism;"
# "To repeatedly demonstrate the practice of democracy to a circle of individualists with the hope of long-distance and, perhaps much later, latitude and mass action;"
# "To achieve both objectives without a program, without a club, without organization and without any collective thinking to work against." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
On the topic of who he invited to the meetings of the group, Richter personally decided: "It is my circle of friends. [...] now I hold a meeting once a year, [...] this is called Gruppe 47 [...]. And I invite all the people, who suit me, are friends with me." [10] He left nothing to outside influence from the outset, which was later a heavily-criticized referral process. According to Heinz Ludwig Arnold, who wrote several times on Gruppe 47, Richter’s strength was his organizational talent, as Richter had gained no importance as a writer or a critic, and had not done well in the two readings he had before the group. Gruppe 47’s success became Richter's life task.&lt;ref&gt;Moralic, Izvor. "[https://daily.jstor.org/gruppe-47-group-made-gunter-grass/ Readings from The Electric Chair: The 60th Anniversary of a Post-War Literary Guild Unites German Greats]". ''The Vienna Review'', 1 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The first year ===
Two months after the first meeting, the second meeting of Gruppe 47 was held, in Herrlingen near Ulm, in which the number of participants had doubled. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Among the first-time participants was Richter’s colleague Alfred Andersch, whose essay ''Deutsche Literatur in der Entscheidung'' (''German Literature in the Decision'') received a programmatic significance for the group. 

Starting from the thesis that "genuine artistry" was always "the same as the opposition to Nazism," Andersch stated that "the younger generation stood before a [[tabula rasa]], faced with the necessity to accomplish a renewal of German intellectual life, through original creations." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Andersch’s future plan remained the only essay that was read in the group for a long time.

In the following years, the meetings took place at different places, during spring and fall. At the seventh session in 1950 in Inzigkofen, the ''Preis der Gruppe 47'' (''Prize of Group 47'') was first launched, which in contrast to the established literary prizes, was intended for as yet unknown authors. Franz Joseph Schneider, who had belonged to the group since the previous year, donated a prize of 1000 Deutsche Marks ($532). After completing the readings, the members of the group present democratically voted on the winner. 

The lyricist [[Günter Eich]] was the first to be awarded the prize. He had joined the group during the third meeting in Jugenheim, and was regarded as the most profound author in the group during his early years.&lt;ref&gt;Wegmann, Nikolaus, and Cornelius Reiber. "[https://german.princeton.edu/landmarks/gruppe-47/ Gruppe 47]". Princeton University Department of German.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Richter organized awards of varying amounts for publishers and broadcasters, but only granted them irregularly. Richter allowed the participants to conclude whether or not a prize was to be awarded at each meeting.

==Founding==
The former authors of ''Der Ruf'' met in September 1947 in order to start a new magazine, ''Der Skorpion''. This was not successful because they lacked a sound financial basis. Inspired by the Spanish ''[[Generation of '98|Group 98]]'' they founded the ''Gruppe 47''.

==Organization==
The group met regularly twice a year. Attendance was by invitation only; the organizers would send [[postcard]]s listing the date and location to anyone who was deemed worthy of invitation, and only invitees and their spouses were allowed entry. No consistent membership list was kept, and a member who had been invited in the past could find himself without an invite at the whim of the organizers.

The meetings consisted of readings and criticism. A writer was required to read his own work, and could only read [[manuscript]]s which had not been published. At every meeting, prizes were awarded to the authors of the most popular pieces.

Founder and organizer Hans Werner Richter described this format as a "private public".

==Goals==
At first, the expressed goal of the ''Gruppe 47'' was to encourage young
authors, the so-called ''Nachkriegsliteratur'' (post-war literature). In addition, the group openly criticized the idealized, poetic dewey-eyedness of some modern prose, as well as the tendency to write about distant time instead of the here-and-now.

==Literature Prize==
The Literature Prize of Gruppe 47 was awarded to as yet unknown authors starting in 1950. The money for the first two awards was donated by the American publisher, [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Coward-McCann]]. Later it was funded by various publishers and radio stations. Complete list of recipients:

*1950: [[Günter Eich]], for ''"Abgelegene Gehöfte"''
*1951: [[Heinrich Böll]], for ''"Die schwarzen Schafe"''
*1952: [[Ilse Aichinger]] for the story "[[Spiegelgeschichte]]"
*1953: [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], for ''Die gestundete Zeit''
*1954: [[Adriaan Morriën]], for ''Zu große Gastlichkeit verjagt die Gäste''
*1955: [[Martin Walser]], for the story "Templones Ende"
*1958: [[Günter Grass]], for ''[[Die Blechtrommel]]''
*1962: [[Johannes Bobrowski]] for the poems ''Sarmatische Zeit''
*1965: [[Peter Bichsel]], for ''"Die Jahreszeiten"''
*1967: [[Jürgen Becker (author)|Jürgen Becker]], for ''Ränder''

==Decline==
The ''Gruppe 47'' quickly gained popularity, partly through the public profile of its well-known members, and was soon part of the literary establishment in Germany. The onset of its decline began just before the student protests in 1968. There were grave differences of political opinion in the group. Public meetings were discontinued in October 1967, and in 1977 the group was officially disbanded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">[[File:Jugyoku - Crab - Walters 71851 - Top.jpg|thumb|280px|19th-century Japanese belt ornament in hornbill ivory, showing natural [[preen gland]] colouring]]
'''Hornbill ivory''' (also called "golden jade") is a precious ornamental material derived from the [[helmeted hornbill]] (''Buceros vigil''), a large bird of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Borneo]].

Many [[hornbill]] species have "casques", decorative growths on the upper mandible of the bill. In most, the casque has a spongy structure, but in the helmeted hornbill it is solid [[keratin]]. This material, hornbill ivory, has a texture suggesting [[ivory]] but is softer. As it grows it is golden yellow, but the bird rubs its casque on its [[Uropygial gland|preen gland]], whose oily secretion tints the surface of the casque bright red.

Native peoples in the helmeted hornbill's range, such as the [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] and [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]], have long carved the casques. In Malaysia, hornbill-ivory rings were said to change colour when near poisonous food.&lt;ref name="ivoryhound.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivoryhound.com/articles_hornbill_ivory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307171936/http://www.ivoryhound.com/articles_hornbill_ivory.htm |archivedate=2005-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[China|Chinese]] encountered the material in the 14th century and it soon became an important trade item at [[Brunei]]. According to [[Tom Harrisson]], writing in the first (1960) edition of ''The Birds of Borneo'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is likely that the casques were mainly exported raw, and worked with a heat treatment and pressing - of which no detailed description survives - in China, to preserve and heighten the lovely deep golden and surface red patina of the fresh ivory.  The Chinese probably got the idea of using ''ho-ting'' from the Dayaks, then improved the technique at their end.  The uses of hornbill casques in Borneo are various and frequently effective; we will discuss those presently.  While the Borneo usages persist to this day, all trace of the art of the Chinese carver seems to have vanished.  Very little has survived of a remarkable craft which undoubtedly paid for many of the old jars, plates, and beads still decorating the longhouses or wives of better-off Bornean pagans many generations later.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisson (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Ming dynasty]], the Chinese valued hornbill ivory above true [[ivory]] or [[jade]]. They carved the casques, or made them into sheets, coloured them with the secretion of the preen gland, and made them into [[belt buckle]]s for high officials. They called hornbill ivory ''hèdǐng'' ([[Wade–Giles]] ''ho-ting''), which is said to be their approximation of an indigenous name&lt;ref name="ivoryhound.com"/&gt; (but means "crane head", and thus many Chinese thought the substance came from a [[crane (bird)|crane]] rather than a hornbill). The [[Japan]]ese also carved imported hornbill ivory into such objects as ''[[netsuke]]''.

By the early 20th century, the helmeted hornbill became rare because it was slaughtered for its casque. Now legal trade in hornbill ivory is limited to certified antiques, and hornbill-ivory carvings are more valuable than those of any true ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acstones.com/gemofmonth/2005/gemofmonth.03.05.html|title=gemofmonth.html|work=acstones.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published quarterly by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. As of March 2018, the journal is led by an interim editor, [[Ann Garry]], and two interim co-editors, [[Serene Khader]] and [[Alison Stone]].&lt;ref name=EditorialBoard/&gt; Book reviews are published by ''Hypatia Reviews Online (HRO)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hypatiareviews.org/ ''Hypatia Reviews Online''].&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia, Inc.&lt;ref name=missionandvision&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypatia Inc|url=https://missionandvision.org/nonprofit/262868769/hypatia-inc/overview|publisher=Mission&amp;Vision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310062603/https://missionandvision.org/nonprofit/262868769/hypatia-inc/overview|archivedate=10 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the journal arose out of meetings of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] (SWIP) in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy | url = http://pembroke-archives.squarespace.com/hypatia-a-journal-of-feminist-philosophy-1/ | publisher = [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] | access-date = 29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt; Philosopher and legal scholar [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] became the founding editor in 1982, when it was published as a "piggy back" issue of the ''[[Women's Studies International Forum]]''.&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009/&gt; Named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a philosopher who was murdered by a mob in [[415]] CE, it became an independent journal in 1986.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;

''Hypatia'' became [[#2017 dispute|involved in a damaging dispute]] in April 2017 when its associate editors published an unauthorized apology for the journal's publication of an article on [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]], after the author and article were criticized on [[social media]].

''Hypatia'' has its roots in regional meetings of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] (SWIP), established in 1972. One of SWIP's earliest ideas was that it would set up a philosophy journal.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gruen |first1=Lori |author-link1=Lori Gruen|last2=Wylie|first2=Alison |author-link2=Alison Wylie|title=Feminist Legacies/Feminist Futures: 25th Anniversary Special Issue—Editors' Introduction |journal=Hypatia |date=Fall 2010 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=725–732|jstor=40928652}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought of "[[A Room of One's Own|a journal of our own"]] was very powerful, according to Kathryn Morgan  ([[University of Toronto|Toronto]]), speaking in 2009 on the history of ''Hypatia''.&lt;ref name="Interview 00:08:45"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Hypatia Founders and Editors|url=https://vimeo.com/13360820|publisher=25th Anniversary Conference: Feminist Legacies/Feminist Futures, University of Washington|date=24 October 2009|at=From 00:08:45|ref={{sfnref|25th Anniversary Conference|2009}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, according to [[Linda Martín Alcoff]] ([[City University of New York|CUNY]]), president of the Hypatia Inc. board of directors since February 2018,&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018/&gt; philosophers who wanted to write about gender-related issues were being silenced in a discipline "riven by unabashed bias and vested interest, inflicting its own form of unapologetic mob violence".&lt;ref name=Alcoff4May2017/&gt;

SWIP decided in 1977 to set up an [[editorial board]] to plan the journal; the first board was put together by [[Ann Garry]] ([[California State University, Los Angeles|Cal State LA]]) and Jacqueline Thomason ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]]).&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;{{efn|The 1977 SWIP editorial board included [[Ann Garry]], Jacqueline Thomason, [[Sandra Bartky]], Candace Groudine, [[Sandra Harding]], [[Sarah Hoagland]], [[Alison Jaggar]], [[Helen Longino]], [[Linda López McAlister]], [[Kathryn Morgan]], Janice Moulton, Connie Crank Price, and Joyce Trebilco.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;}} At a meeting in Denver in the spring of 1979, the board agreed that [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] ([[University of Richmond|UR]]) should be the founding editor.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt; Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]].&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Al-Hibri|first1=Azizah Y|author-link=Azizah Y. al-Hibri|title=A Journal of Her Own: Hypatia Founders and Editors|url=https://vimeo.com/12221774|publisher=25th Anniversary Conference: Feminist Legacies/Feminist Futures, University of Washington|date=22 October 2009|at=Courtesy of Vimeo, 00:05:50–00:08:15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:08:57}} ''[[Women's Studies International Forum]]'' agreed to publish the new journal as an annual "piggy back" issue of its own, which it did for three years,&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009/&gt; and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=from 00:08:45}}

The group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development.&lt;ref name=Alcoff4May2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alcoff|first1=Linda Martín|author-link=Linda Martín Alcoff|title=Here's my take.|url=https://www.facebook.com/lsalcoff/posts/10156108465053047|publisher=Facebook|archiveurl=https://archive.is/PYN7m|archivedate=15 May 2017|date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue.{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:11:30}} It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;

The journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have "deep roots in philosophy".{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:08:57}} According to [[Linda López McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been "stoned to death for telling the truth".{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=00:02:50}} The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=from 00:05:45}}

The journal had published Tuvel's article, "In Defense of Transracialism", in its spring 2017 edition after the standard double-anonymous [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]].

In July 2017 Scholz resigned as editor-in-chief, along with Shelley Wilcox, editor of ''Hypatia Reviews Online''.

Eight of the associate editors resigned. In their resignation statement, they wrote that the current controversy was "grounded in long-standing differences and tensions within the field."

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Dan Simmons]]. It is the first book of his [[Hyperion Cantos]]. The plot of the novel features multiple [[worldline|time-lines]] and characters. It follows a similar structure to ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. This book is succeeded by the 1990 science fiction novel ''[[The Fall of Hyperion (novel)|The Fall of Hyperion]]'' by the same writer.

==Plot summary==
{{Long plot|date=January 2010}}

===Background===
In the 28th century, humanity has spread across the galaxy, first aboard "[[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] drive" ships and then through "[[farcaster]]s", which permit nearly instantaneous travel regardless of distance. However, many planets are of little economic interest and disconnected from the farcasters. These planets can only be reached by spaceship, resulting in [[time dilation]] effects which cause "time debt" accruals.

The farcaster network (the "WorldWeb") is the infrastructural and economical basis of the Hegemony of Man and thus determines the whole culture and society. Also flowing across these portals are the structures of the datasphere (a network reminiscent of the Internet in design, but far more advanced). Inseparable from mankind's technologies is the powerful, knowledgeable, and utterly inscrutable [[TechnoCore]], the vast agglomeration of millions of [[AI]]s who run almost every piece of high technology of mankind. The unthinking hubris of man resulted in the death of the home-world ([[Earth]])&amp;mdash;which was consumed by an artificial black hole running out of control&amp;mdash;and this arrogant philosophy was carried forth to the stars, for centuries.

The Hegemony itself is a largely decadent society, relying on its military to incorporate into the WorldWeb the colony planets, even unwillingly, and to defend the Hegemony from attacks by the [[Ousters]], "interstellar barbarians" who dwell free of and beyond the bounds of the Hegemony and shun all the works of the TechnoCore (especially farcasters). Ostensibly a [[direct democracy]] governed through the "All [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]" forum, the Hegemony is also managed by a chief executive officer advised by the TechnoCore advisory council and the Hegemony Senate.

All the 'Core's advice and predictions are confounded by mysterious structures on the remote colony world Hyperion (named after the moon of Saturn) that are commonly regarded as the Time Tombs. The tombs are encased in an anti-entropic field that is theorised to be carrying them backwards in time (suggesting that the tombs were built in the distant future for some unknown purpose) and are said to be guarded by a legendary time travelling creature known as the [[Hyperion Cantos#The Shrike|Shrike]]. The Shrike is the subject of a cult, the ''Church of the Final Atonement'', commonly known as the Shrike Church. Occasionally the church sends a prime number of pilgrims to the Time Tombs; there is a legend that all but one are slaughtered and the remaining pilgrim is granted a wish.

The Ousters have been long obsessed with Hyperion, and on the eve of their invasion and a probable war, a final pilgrimage has been organised. Seven pilgrims have been carefully selected by unseen elements of the TechnoCore to make the journey to the Time Tombs and the Shrike, with the objective of aiding the Hegemony in the imminent war. Aboard a treeship the pilgrims finally meet after being revived out of their [[cryogenic freezing|cryogenic storage]] state; and, collectively overwhelmed by the mystery and magnitude of their situation, they decide that they will each tell their tale to enliven the long trip to the Tombs, to get to know each other, and to make sense of their situation. Simmons uses this device to unfold the panorama of this universe, its history and conflicts, and each story gives a greater context to the others. The story opens ''[[in medias res]]'' with the Consul recalled to the WorldWeb and the seven pilgrims (the infant Rachel does not count) drawing lots to see who will tell their tale first in the hopes of revealing a reason they were chosen and how to survive.

===Part One, The Priest's Tale: "The Man who Cried God"===
"The Priest's Tale" starts shortly after being awakened from "fugue" on an expensive and rare Templar Tree-Ship. It describes the stories of Father Paul Duré and Father Lenar Hoyt, two of only several thousand remaining members of the Roman Catholic Church. As a younger man, Father Lenar Hoyt is assigned to escort the [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhardian]]-inclined [[Jesuit]] Father Paul Duré, a theologian, archaeologist and ethnologist, into exile. The aging Duré, in disgrace for fabricating archaeological discoveries, has chosen Hyperion as a suitable location on which to complete his exile.  He reveals to Hoyt that he plans to travel to an isolated region along Hyperion's Cleft, where rumors and centuries-old accounts place the legendary Bikura civilization, in order to establish an ethnological research station among them.

Father Duré travels to the continent of Aquila, where the Cleft is located. He reaches Perecebo Plantation and is given a guide named Tuk. Duré and Tuk venture into the "flame forest" where electrical [[tesla trees]] are found. Traveling during the forest's inactive season, they manage to make it through unharmed and reach the Cleft.

Shortly thereafter, Tuk is murdered and Duré stumbles into the nearby Bikura village.  The Bikura are an unintelligent people, incapable of grasping most concepts but who believe Duré is "of the cross" (due to his wearing a crucifix) but not "of the cruciform". After many weeks, Duré steals into their sacred cavern and discovers a finely wrought cross-shaped artwork that predates human spaceflight by millennia. He deduces that they are survivors from a seedship crash centuries earlier who have been infected with cross-shaped organisms called cruciforms that integrate themselves into their host.  After death, the cruciform rebuilds the physical body and resurrects them. The price of immortality is that resurrection information is lost, and over time they become unintelligent and androgynous, losing all distinguishing features. When he is seen topless while bathing the Bikura discover he has no cruciform on him. Debating killing him they instead lead him into Hyperion's labyrinth system where he encounters the Shrike and is unknowingly infected with a cruciform.

After discovering the truth, Duré attempted to cut the cruciform out of his body but failed. Next he attempted to flee the village but after traveling only a few kilometers from the village the cruciform inflicted extreme pain to keep him near. Father Hoyt, immediately sets to return to Hyperion, having experienced only a few weeks of travel in his reference frame, but his "time debt" means seven years have passed and he finds Father Duré's remains there, burnt and decomposing in the flame forest. Hoyt tells the other pilgrims that some of his guides on that expedition died by accident and the rest nuked the village and the story ends.

When the time comes to leave the treeship Hoyt is late. The consul finds him in his stateroom in immense pain, his "ultra-morphine" auto-injector having failed. The consul promises to assist Hoyt in return for hearing the true story. Hoyt reveals in a final desperate act, Duré crucified himself to a tesla tree with his journal wrapped in flame proof cloth. For seven years, Father Duré had been continually electrocuted and resurrected by the cruciform, never allowed to die. As Hoyt touches it, the cruciform falls from Duré's body and this allows him to finally die the "true death" and be at peace. Also revealing that his guides did not die by accident they were actually murdered by the Bikura and Hoyt was spared as, like Duré, he wore a crucifix. In retaliation the entire Bikura village was destroyed with shaped nuke charges but not before Hoyt is fitted with both a cruciform of his own and also with the cruciform that was implanted into Duré.

===Part Two, The Soldier's Tale: "The War Lovers"===
Having arrived on Hyperion, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad's tale begins with a flashback to his days training in the FORCE (the general name for the Hegemony's military) academy on [[Mars in fiction|Mars]], when he was immersed in a training simulation of the 15th century [[Battle of Agincourt]]. During the battle, a mysterious soldier from "outside" saves Kassad from a French knight and becomes his lover. Kassad and his mystery savior meet repeatedly in further simulations until Kassad's final year in the Academy. After Kassad graduates from the Academy, the young Martian man becomes a FORCE officer.

Over his military career, Kassad earns a reputation for bloodlust, and after a brutal conflict with Ousters on the system Bressia, gains the nickname "the Butcher of South Bressia". After the conflict, Kassad is grievously wounded by a leftover boobytrap and is placed on a Hegemony medical ship, which is attacked by Ousters. After a fight with the Ousters, Kassad hijacks an Ouster shuttle and crashes it onto a planet he learns to be Hyperion. There he is reunited with his lover, who introduces herself for the first time as Moneta. Kassad briefly witnesses the Tree of Pain, a gigantic steel tree where the Shrike has impaled its victims, as it phases in and out of existence. Moneta then introduces him to the Shrike, and the two teach him to use time slowing abilities in combat. The three are attacked by an Ouster landing party, but with the use of these abilities Kassad and the Shrike mercilessly slaughter their attackers. Overcome with bloodlust, Kassad begins making love with Moneta amongst the corpses of his victims. Upon climax, Kassad suddenly realizes that Moneta and the Shrike have been manipulating him and wish to use him to spark an interstellar war in which billions of people will die. At this moment, Moneta undergoes a horrific transformation into the Shrike and Kassad flees. After Kassad is rescued and returned to the WorldWeb, he resigns from FORCE and becomes an anti-war activist. His purpose on the travelers' pilgrimage is to track down and kill Moneta / the Shrike.

After Kassad has finished telling the story, the Consul explains that because the Tree of Pain is moving backwards in time, Kassad may have seen victims on it that would be put on it in the future, and suggests that it is possible that he saw one or more of the pilgrims on the tree. When queried, Kassad reveals he saw one of the pilgrims on the tree, but refuses to disclose which pilgrim it was.

===Part Three, The Poet's Tale: "Hyperion Cantos"===
On board a giant manta-drawn riverboat manned by androids, Martin Silenus tells his tale. He was born as a wealthy scion of an ancient dying North American house, growing up in the time around the "Big Mistake", which led to the destruction of Earth. Silenus trained as a poet, but his training was interrupted when the Kiev Team's black hole "ate" the Earth; his mother dispatched her son aboard a slower-than-light flight to a nearby system, calculating that the shrunken family fortune would accumulate enough in [[compound interest]] over the century the voyage would take that the family's debt would be paid off and enough would be left over for Martin to live on for a time.

Unfortunately, the accounts were nationalized by the Hegemony, and Silenus suffered brain damage during the voyage. Deep in penury, Silenus had to work as a common laborer. The back-breaking toil forces Silenus's mind to flee to higher planes, and as he recovers his use of language, he starts work on his ''Hyperion Cantos'', a work he began as a parody of [[John Keats]]' famous poem, but which evolved into a dual account of Silenus's life and an epic account of the [[Titanomachia]], in which the Hegemony of Man takes the part of the Titans and the TechnoCore the Olympians. His ''Dying Earth'' (as it is called, in an explicit reference to [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Dying Earth]]'' series) becomes an enormous hit, selling billions and making him a multi-millionaire.

Eventually he falls into debt again (due to divorce and the extreme cost of maintaining a house whose rooms are located on over thirty separate planets and connected by continually active, expensive to operate farcaster portals) and in an attempt to produce another hit has a larger unabridged version of his cantos published, which is predicted to fail by his publisher. The work is a terrible flop, selling few copies and not recouping the money he was advanced. In order to pay his debt, Silenus is forced to produce further hackwork for his "Dying Earth" series, a misery many artists face. One day he realizes that his Cantos, his greatest work, has not been added to for years; his [[muse]] had fled. Silenus leaves his lifestyle, liquidates his assets, and signs on with Sad King Billy.

Billy is an aristocrat of the planet Asquith, descended from the [[House of Windsor]], and an intelligent and sensitive lover and critic of the arts. Fearful of the FORCE General Horace Glennon-Height's rebellion against the Hegemony, Billy decides to relocate to Hyperion and create a new Renaissance by establishing a kingdom of artists. He chooses for his capital a location near the Time Tombs on the then-even less inhabited Hyperion, reasoning that their presence will give the proper ambience for the creation of great art.

For ten years, all goes well until people begin vanishing, with no abductors ever seen. At the same time, Silenus' muse returns, and he continues work on the Cantos. Soon, the culprit is discovered to be the Shrike. At this time, Silenus becomes convinced that it is the Shrike who is his muse, who, in some occult way, his poem had brought into existence. The murders continue until only Silenus is left living in the City of Poets. He writes the last line on the day that the last murder occurs.

One day, Sad King Billy returns to the deserted city. Martin is gone on a trip to the Time Tombs seeking the Shrike, and when he returns to his quarters Billy confronts him with the fact that his writing is dependent on cold-blooded murder, and that it will need more murders if it is to ever be completed. Billy burns his manuscript. After Billy is taken away by the Shrike, Silenus recopies his poem as well as possible. Eventually he leaves Hyperion. In the centuries since, reliant on life-extending treatments, he has been waiting to return to Hyperion to finish the poem.

===Part Four, The Scholar's Tale: "The River Lethe's Taste is Bitter"===
(This is told on an uncrewed, wind-powered landship.) Sol Weintraub, a Jewish academic, had been a professor of ethics on [[Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Barnard.27s Star|Barnard's]] World, the second colony founded from Old Earth. He and his wife, Sarai, had been happy when their only daughter, Rachel, was born forty years ago. She eventually became an archaeologist, and while in her post-graduate studies went on an expedition to study the Time Tombs of Hyperion regarding the Shrike as a myth (the Shrike not yet having become active again).

While mapping the so-called Sphinx for hidden passages or rooms, something happens to Rachel: all the instruments and equipment fail, and the Shrike appears in the Sphinx amidst a massive surge of "anti-[[entropy|entropic]] fields". Rachel is returned to the WorldWeb where her parents learn of the novel disease she has contracted, dubbed the "Merlin sickness" (after [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]''), in which every time Rachel goes to sleep, she ages backwards two days (for a net loss of one day per day), losing her memories and in fact physically becoming younger; there is no sign that the condition will reverse itself when she ages backwards to her birth. (However, she still needs to eat and breathe normally, she talks and acts normally while awake, and bruises from medical procedures one day are still present the next.) Rachel's life is shattered by her retrogression, slowly destroying her links with the present; her parents devote their lives to caring for Rachel and trying to cure her. A visit to the Shrike Temple on Lusus sees the bishop there cast out Sol, claiming Rachel doesn't need to be cured when she is the most blessed and cursed human in all of existence. After more than a decade of illness her story is picked up by the news media and Hyperion becomes a tourist destination. Meanwhile, Sol wrestles for years with his dreams in which he is ordered to go to Hyperion and sacrifice Rachel in a replay of the [[Binding of Isaac]]. Weintraub becomes increasingly fascinated with the ethical problem that the Binding presents. Shortly before his wife dies, Sol learns that she has been having the same dream word for word with the same faceted, glowing red eyes that match earlier descriptions of the Shrike's eyes. He also worries about what will happen when Rachel reaches her birthday (her actual age of zero days old which will be very soon), and so he decides to become a pilgrim and to implore the Shrike for a treatment.

Following Sol's story the pilgrims witness a space battle which includes the destruction of the Templar Tree-Ship, one of only five, which carried them to Hyperion. The next morning Het Masteen, True Voice of the Tree and captain of the ship, is not to be found on the landship that has been carrying them from the river to the mountains. Despite a watch being maintained all night and no one onboard hearing anything Masteen's stateroom is found full of blood. Silenus, having witnessed such carnage centuries before, states it is obviously the work of the Shrike.

===Part Five, The Detective's Tale: "The Long Good-Bye"===
(This is told on a suspended [[Aerial lift|cable car]] across the mountains.) [[Fanny Brawne|Brawne]] [[Lamia]], the daughter of a senator of Lusus, eschewed politics for the life of a [[private investigator]] after her father's apparent suicide (which occurred shortly after he and the then junior senator Meina Gladstone proposed a bill to quickly incorporate Hyperion into the WorldWeb). Her client is a "cybrid" (a cloned human body which is controlled through its electronic implants by a TechnoCore intelligence) named "Johnny", who wishes to hire her to investigate his own murder. This cybrid is the genetic clone of famous Romantic poet [[John Keats]], and the AI controlling it was programmed to have the personality and memories of Keats as best as could be reconstructed from surviving materials and the 'Core's finest extrapolations.

Unlike most "retrieved personalities", which are of insufficient fidelity to maintain sanity, Johnny functions quite well (though he disclaims poetic talent). His AI self was murdered by being purposely infected with a long-dormant plague known as AIDS II. A backup could not be brought online for a full minute, causing the loss of five days' worth of data and memory. This limited amnesia was the apparent goal of the assault. Lamia sets out to discover what Johnny had learned or done in those five days to prompt such an assault; initially, all she discovers is that it is somehow related to Hyperion: Johnny should have heard of such a place, permeated as it is with tributes to the poet he is supposed to be, but he has not; such an absence of knowledge in an AI of his ability smacks of deception.

She and Johnny are forcibly farcast to a planet that seems to be a perfect imitation of Old Earth, located somewhere in the [[Hercules cluster]], into a portion of Italy, set around the time-period the human Keats died of [[tuberculosis]] there.

After a few troublesome actions, hunts and rides through the WorldWeb and the TechnoCore the main information is this: the 'Core is not as monolithic as it appears; it is fiercely divided into at least three groups which continually fight each other.

# The ''Stables''. They are the oldest faction, and count some of the very first AIs among their ranks. Their central thesis is that humanity and the TechnoCore need each other, and that the 'Core should continue in the symbiosis. They are also opposed to the UI project (creation of a godlike Ultimate Intelligence): the UI would need the resources that the current AIs use, and they do not wish to die. (In Silenus's Cantos, the Stables are identified with the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, who did not wish to yield to their Olympian successors). They have for decades been subtly working to help the Hegemony in its fight against the Volatiles, quietly seeking to bring Hyperion into the WorldWeb, on the chance that its unpredictability will help them.
# The ''Volatiles''. They generally support the UI project, and they believe that humanity has outlived its usefulness to the 'Core, and that it actually now poses a real danger, and therefore should be eradicated. They are behind many events, but they fear the planet of Hyperion, because it is a "random variable": it could tip the scales against the 'Core; the effects of Hyperion are impossible for them to analyze.
# The ''Ultimates''. They care only for the UI project. They are quite willing to sacrifice their lives to the UI, believing that the value of its existence far outweighs their own. Previously they had been aligned with the Stables against the Volatiles, as humanity (and especially the cybrid retrieval projects) still posed some puzzles which when solved would help in the UI project, but it is implied that they feel they've gathered enough data, and have re-aligned now with the Volatiles to get rid of human kind.

At the end, pregnant by the meanwhile dead Johnny, carrying parts of his consciousness in an implant and revered by the Church of The Shrike as "the mother of our salvation", Lamia joins the pilgrims.

===Part Six, The Consul's Tale: "Remembering Siri"===
Like Father Hoyt, the Consul tells another tale before his own. This is entitled "Remembering Siri", and is a largely unmodified version of the short story of the same name in ''[[Prayers to Broken Stones]]'' (where Simmons mentions that this story provided the seed around which the Hyperion universe was created).

The Consul's grandparents had been Merin Aspic (of Lusus) and Siri (of the lush ocean-planet Maui-Covenant). Aspic had signed a long-term contract to engage in several voyages aboard a spinship (with all the years lost to relativistic time dilation that that implies), which would make multiple trips to Maui-Covenant to build a farcaster portal, thereby connecting Maui-Covenant to the waiting voracious hordes of Hegemony tourists. Eventually he falls in love with the beautiful girl named Siri. However, his best friend is killed by a Covenanter who disagrees violently with Maui-Covenant joining the WorldWeb (the events parallel those of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').

Siri and Merin meet six more times, but each time Merin – due to the relativistic time dilation of his journeys – is only a little older, while Siri ages at the usual rate, a difference which grows ever more pronounced until the eighth visit (Seventh Reunion), in which Merin returns to find Siri dead of old age, and the farcaster about to be activated. The flood of Hegemony visitors and the induction of Maui-Covenant fully into the WorldWeb would, as prophesied, utterly ruin the ecology and all the dolphin, human, and motile isle settlers hold dear. Faced with this bleak reality, Merin chooses to sabotage the farcaster, beginning "Siri's War", a hopeless resistance against the Hegemony.

In crushing the rebellion, the military destroys the ecology as thoroughly as the tourists would have, but far more violently: all the dolphins die, as do a large proportion of the original Maui-Covenant colonists. The latter Consul was forbidden by Merin to join in the fighting, and so he survived to thrive with distinction in the Hegemony diplomatic corps. There he aids the Hegemony in destroying whatever resistance the Hegemony encounters. He bides his time, waiting for a chance to betray the Hegemony and achieve revenge.

When he is sent as an agent to the Ousters he becomes their agent, but betrays them too when he prematurely activates mysterious Ouster devices intended to release the Shrike from the Time Tombs when it would have a chance to enter the WorldWeb. He knows of the many deaths this action will cause and was driven to this by the Ouster's irrefutable evidence that the Big Mistake that destroyed Earth was deliberately planned by elements of the TechnoCore and the Hegemony, and that the Hegemony was deliberately killing off any species which might become a rival to man in order to maintain its place, and that the 'Core feared Ousters who were out of their control, and sought to use the Hyperion system as bait in order to eliminate them.

==Major characters==
* '''[[Hyperion Cantos#The Shrike|The Shrike]]''' is a menacing and immensely powerful creature of uncertain origin and motives which appears throughout the narrative, often in a seemingly antagonistic role. It is known for impaling people on a massive tree made of metal, whose branches are massive thorns. It is named after the "[[Shrike]]" bird which impales insects and small animals on the thorns of a tree.  The pilgrims expect to find the Shrike in the Time Tombs, which are the ultimate destination of their journey, but as they tell their individual tales it becomes clear that the creature is already deeply connected to each of them. 
* '''The Consul''' is the former planetary governor of Hyperion. He is for much of the first novel enigmatic, observing and recording the stories of the other Shrike Pilgrims but reluctant to record his own. He is one of the few thousand individuals amongst the hundred and fifty billion Hegemony citizens to own his own private [[starship]].
* '''Meina Gladstone''' is the CEO of the Hegemony of Man and Commander in Chief, former senator, residing on [[Tau Ceti in fiction|Tau Ceti]] Center.
* '''Lenar Hoyt''' is a Roman Catholic priest in his early 30s, in a universe where Catholicism has shrunk to a shadow of its former self, claiming only a few thousand followers.
* '''Fedmahn Kassad''' is a colonel in the Hegemony of Man's FORCE military, of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent from [[Mars]].
* '''Brawne Lamia''' is a private detective. Her name derives from a combination of [[Fanny Brawne]], the love of [[John Keats]], and the eponymous creature of his [[Lamia and Other Poems]]. Brawne is the daughter of Senator Byron Lamia, once a friend of CEO Meina Gladstone's, who "apparently" committed suicide when Brawne was a child.
* '''Het Masteen''' is the most mysterious of all seven pilgrims. He is a Templar—a nature priest of sorts—who captains the Treeship Yggdrasill that brings the pilgrims to Hyperion.
** Treeships are [[Dyson tree|living tree]]s that are propelled by [[Erg Hyperion|erg]]s (an alien being that emits force fields) through space. The ergs also generate the containment fields (force fields) around the tree that keep its atmosphere intact. There are only five treeships in existence including Yggdrasill.
* '''Martin Silenus''' is a foul-mouthed poet. Born on Earth before its destruction, he is incredibly old. Like [[John Keats|Keats]], he is working on an unfinished epic poem.
* '''Sol Weintraub''' is a Jewish scholar. His daughter was afflicted with an illness dubbed the "Merlin Sickness" that caused her to age backwards: she gets younger as time progresses.

'''Romanesque art''' is the architecture of Europe which emerged in the late 10th century and evolved into the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style during the 12th century. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in England is more traditionally referred to as [[Norman architecture]].

The style can be identified across Europe with certain significant architectural features occurring everywhere. There are other characteristic which differ greatly from region to region.

Most of the buildings that are still standing are churches, some of which are very large abbey churches and cathedrals. The majority of these are still in use, some of them having been substantially altered over the centuries.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list presents a comparison of Romanesque churches, abbeys and cathedrals of different countries. The second section describes the architectural features that can be identified within pictures of major architectural elements.

==Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics==

=== Features of Romanesque architecture that is seen in different areas around Europe. ===

* '''Small churches''' are generally aiseless, with a projecting apse.
* '''Large churches''' are basilical with a nave flanked by aisles and divided by an arcade.&lt;ref name=BF303&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VII, pp. 303-308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Abbey churches and cathedrals''' often had transepts.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Round arches in arcades, windows, doors and vaults.&lt;ref name=BF308&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VII, pp. 308-310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Massive walls&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Towers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Piers&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Stout columns&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Buttresses of shallow projection&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Groin vaulting&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Portals with sculpture and mouldings&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Decorative arcades as an external feature, and frequently internal also&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Cushion capitals&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Murals&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;

===Features which are regionally diversified===

These features often have strong local and regional traditions. However, the movement of senior clergy, stonemasons and other craftsmen meant that these traditional features are sometimes found at distant locations.

* Ground plan&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Facade
* Position and number of towers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of towers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Presence and shape of spires
* Shape of the east end&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of columns&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of piers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Building material&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Local diversity in decorative details that was dependent on local craftsmen.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* '''Pre-Romanesque''' is demonstrated in Italy by the construction of churches with thick walls of undressed stone, very small windows and massive fortresslike character.
* [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Italian Byzantine]] architecture formed a stylistic link with the architecture of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Ancient Rome]], through which the basilica plan and the Classical form of column were transmitted.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* The architecture of Northern Italy has features in common with French and German Romanesque.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* The architecture of Southern Italy and Sicily was influenced by both [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Building stone was available in mountainous regions, while brick was employed for most building in river valleys and plains. The availability of marble had a profound effect on the decoration of buildings.&lt;ref name=BF311&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VIII, pp. 311-319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and continuance of local rather than unified rule meant the construction and continued existence of many Romanesque civic buildings, and a large number of cathedrals.
* A great many religious buildings of this period remain, many of them little altered. Other buildings include fortifications, castles, civic buildings, and innumerable domestic buildings that are often much altered.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* Large churches often have basilical form, with a projecting apse.&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Some large churches have projecting transepts as at Pisa Cathedral.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;
* Towers are freestanding and may be circular as at Pisa.&lt;ref name=BF320&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VIII, pp. 320-328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows are small.&lt;ref name=BF329&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VIII, pp. 329-333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The façade takes two forms, that which coincides with the basilical section of nave and aisles, as at [[Pisa Cathedral]] and that which screens the form, such as [[San Michele, Pavia]].&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* [[Dwarf gallery|Dwarf galleries]] are the prevalent form of decoration on the façade as at [[Pisa Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* A number of churches have facades and interiors that are faced with polychrome marble, as at [[San Miniato al Monte]].&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;  The rest of a brick exterior was generally left undecorated with some notable exceptions including Pisa Cathedral.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;
* Portals were rarely large and were square rather than round, as at [[San Miniato al Monte]].  Decorative tympanums, where they exist, are mosaic, fresco or shallow relief, as at [[San Zeno, Verona]].&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Shallow relief carving in marble was a feature of some facades, as at San Zeno and [[Modena Cathedral]]
* Ocular and [[Rose window|Wheel windows]] are commonly found in facades, as at San Zeno and Modena Cathedral.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Portals are sometimes covered by an open porch supported on two columns standing on the backs of lions at San Zeno, Verona.&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Internally, large churches generally have arcades resting on columns of Classical form.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* There is little emphasis on vertical mouldings.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* The wall surface above the arcade was covered with decorative marble, mosaic or fresco.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;  Galleries such as that at Pisa were uncommon, but occur in convent churches as nuns' galleries.
* Open timber roofs prevailed.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Ribbed vaults, when used, are large, square and domical, spanning two bays as at San Michele, Pavia, and [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]].
* The crossing is often covered by a dome, as at [[Bari Cathedral]] and Pisa Cathedral (where the dome is oval and of a later date).&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* The choir may be above a vaulted crypt, accessible from the nave or aisles, as at San Zeno, Verona.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Freestanding polygonal baptisteries were common, as at [[Parma Cathedral]] and the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], Florence.&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Cloisters often have an array of elaborately twisted columns, and fanciful decoration in mosaic tiles as at the Romanesque cloister of the Ancient Basilica of [[St Paul's Outside the Walls]], Rome.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;
* The large churches and cathedrals of Southern Italy and Sicily were influenced by Norman architecture, as at [[Trani#Main sights|Trani Cathedral]] and [[Bari Cathedral]] in [[Apulia]].&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Churches in Sicily were influenced by Islamic architecture, in the employment of the pointed arch as at [[Monreale Cathedral]] and [[Palermo Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;

File:Angouleme cathedral StPierre ac.JPG|[[Angouleme Cathedral]] shows a turreted screen facade which gives little indication of the building's form and is typical of southern France. 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* Monastic tradition was a major influence on church architecture with the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]], founded 910 AD, being the largest church in the world at that time.&lt;ref name=BF340&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter IX, pp. 340-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The foundation of the Cistercian Order in 1098 introduced a simplicity of design and austerity of ornament.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* Particularly in the south, the existence of Roman structures such as the [[Pont du Gard]]  played a part in the development of storied arcades and other structural forms.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* Building stone was readily available, including high grade limestone suitable for fine carving.&lt;ref name=BF335&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter IX, pp. 335-340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For much of the period [[Normandy]] were comparatively large and powerful political unit, and developed consistent styles that affected much of northern France.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* South of the [[Loire Valley]] churches showed considerable diversity of architectural form and are often without aisles.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* The pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in northern Spain led to the establishment of [[Way of St. James|four pilgrim routes]] through France, and the establishment of many religious houses along the routes.
* Crusade and pilgrimage brought contact with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]] that influenced the forms of a number of churches such as [[Périgueux Cathedral|Saint-Front, Périgueux]].&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* The development of ribbed vaulting at [[Saint-Etienne, Caen]], and the adoption of a number of new techniques within a single influential building, the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], led to the early employment of the Gothic methods of construction and style from 1140 onwards.&lt;ref name=BF340/&gt;
* A great many abbey churches, some of which are now cathedrals or have been elevated to the rank of [[Minor Basilica]], date from this period, and are among the finest architectural works of France.  There are also numerous village churches, many of which have remained little changed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* Large churches of northern have basilical form of nave and aisles separated by arcades.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Large churches of southern France may be without aisles, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Churches generally have transepts.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The eastern end often takes the form of an apse that is almost as high as the walls.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The high apse was increasingly surrounded by an ambulatory and later Romanesque churches have a fully developed chevet with radiating chapels.
* In Normandy, two towers on the façade flanking the nave became standard for large churches and influenced the subsequent Romanesque and Gothic facades of Northern France, England, Sicily and other buildings across Europe.
*  At the Abbey Church of Cluny, as well as paired towers on the west front, there was a variety of towers large and small.  Of these the octagonal tower over the crossing and smaller transept tower remain intact.  This arrangement was to influence other churches such as the [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse]].
* Windows are increasingly of larger size and are often coupled, particularly in cloisters and towers.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The façade takes two forms, that with two large towers, such as that at Saint-Etienne, Caen, and the screen form with two small flanking turrets, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]]. 
* There are often three portals, as at the [[Abbey of la Trinité, Caen]], &lt;small&gt;left&lt;/small&gt;
* Façade decoration is rich and varied, with the central portal being the major feature.&lt;ref name=BF347&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter IX, pp. 347-352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large sculptured portals are a distinguishing feature of French Romanesque. The portal is deeply recessed and the jambs set with shafts and mouldings. They typically have lintels, supporting a tympanum carved in high relief.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Interiors generally employed piers to support the arcades, rather than columns.  The form of the piers became increasing complex with shafts and mouldings leading into the mouldings of the arch, or the vault as at Saint-Etienne Nevers. &lt;small&gt;left&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* In the 12th century, cylindrical piers with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style capitals came into use.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* A pattern of three stages: vault, arcade and clerestory was established in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Masonry vaults were preferred for larger churches, and were initially [[barrel vault|barrel]] or [[groin vault]]s, often with arches spanning the nave between the vaults.  Vaulted bays are square.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The earliest ribbed high vault in France is at Saint-Etienne, Caen (1120).  The wide adoption of this method led to the development of Gothic architecture.&lt;ref name=BF340/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Several aiseless churches of [[Aquitaine]] and [[Anjou]] are roofed with domes, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* The Pre-Romanesque tradition of architecture was Saxon. The thick-walled aiseless churches had archway leading into rectangular chancels. Bell towers often had an attached circular stair turret.  Windows were often arched or had triangular heads.&lt;ref name=BF386&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc= Chapter XII, pp. 386-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Norman invasion of 1066 unified the government of England.&lt;ref name=BF386/&gt;
*  Norman bishops were installed in English cathedrals and monasteries were established following Benedictine, Cluniac, Cistercian, and Augustinian rules.&lt;ref name=BF386/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Monasteries were established in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, suppressing local Celtic monastic tradition.&lt;ref name=TOK&gt;{{harvnb|O'Keeffe|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many cathedrals were of monastic foundation serving a dual role, which affected their architecture, in particular the extended length of the choir and transepts.&lt;ref name=BF402&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was a great diversity of building stone including limestone, New Red Sandstone, flint and granite.&lt;ref name=BF379&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, pp. 379-386}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In England, the relative political stability led to large diocese with few bishops. Cathedrals were correspondingly few in number and large in scale.
* Geographical isolation led to the development of distinct regional character.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* The climate led to the construction of long naves to facilitate processions in wet weather.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Of the medieval cathedrals, nearly all were commenced in this period and several have remained substantially Norman structures.&lt;ref name=BF490&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many parish churches were commenced at this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox |Ford|1961|pp= 47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The abbey churches suffered destruction at the time of the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] in the early 16th century and the majority were reduced to ruins, some surviving as parish churches.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* It is characteristic of the medieval churches of the British Isles and England in particular that they were continually expanded, altered and rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifton-Taylor|1986|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, although Norman buildings are numerous, few are intact, and at some, such as [[Lincoln Cathedral]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Worcester Cathedral]], Norman architecture might be represented only by the portals, the columns of the nave or the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifton-Taylor|1986|pp=29–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Norman facades of cathedrals and large abbeys follow the two basic forms found in France, that with paired towers as at [[Southwell Minster]] and that with framing turrets as at [[Rochester Cathedral]].
* Portals are usually arched and decorated with chevrons and other geometric ornament, barbaric faces and spirals.&lt;ref name=BF496/&gt;  There are a few carved Romanesque tympanums, with a [[Christ in Majesty]] at Rochester Cathedral. The ornamentation of portals in Ireland have distinctive elements of Celtic design as at the gabled portal of [[Clonfert Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=TOK/&gt;
* Side porches are common and are often the usually mode of entrance, the western portal only being opened for major festivals.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Blind arcading is used as a major decorative feature, often around internal walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows are comparatively large and may be arranged in tiers as in the transepts of [[Peterborough Cathedral]].  Paired windows occur in towers.&lt;ref name=BF496&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 496}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Naves of cathedrals and abbey churches are of great length, and transepts are of strong projection.&lt;ref name=BF402/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF490/&gt;
* Chancels of cathedrals and abbey churches are also very long.&lt;ref name=BF402/&gt;
* The chancels of cathedrals and abbeys were round and with an ambulatory in the French manner, as indicated at Peterborough and [[Norwich Cathedral]]s but none have survived unchanged.&lt;ref name=BF490/&gt;
* Large central towers are characteristic, as at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] and Norwich Cathedral.
* Many round towers occur in Ireland. They are also found in Saxon (Pre-Romanesque) architecture in England as stair towers attached to larger towers of square plan.
* The nave rises in three stages, arcade, gallery and clerestory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The arcade has two forms: arches resting on large cylindrical masonry columns as at [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]] and [[Hereford Cathedral]]s, and arches springing from composite piers as at Peterborough and [[Ely Cathedral]]s.

* Crypts are groin vaulted, as at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt;
* Nearly every large Norman church has a later, Gothic high vault, except at Peterborough and Ely Cathedrals which have retained trussed wooden ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaults at Durham are of unique importance, that of the south aisle being the oldest ribbed vault in the world, and that of the nave being the earliest pointed ribbed vault in the world.&lt;ref name=BF397&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ribbed vaults of the Norman period exist over the aisles at [[Peterborough Cathedral]] and other large churches.&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt;
*  Barrel vaults are rare, examples being St John's Chapel, [[Tower of London]]&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt; and several 12th century monastic churches in Ireland including [[Rock of Cashel#Buildings on the Rock|Cormac's Chapel]] and [[Killaloe Cathedral|St Flannan's oratory]].&lt;ref name=TOK/&gt;

===Influences===
* Prior to the beginning of the period, the greater part of the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by Muslims, with Christian rulers controlling only a strip at the north of the country.&lt;ref name=BF635&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 635-639&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BK178/&gt;
* By 900 the [[Reconquista]] had increased the area under Christian rule to about one third of Iberia. This expanded to about half the area by 1150 and included Galicia, Leon, Castille, Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia and Portugal.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* Romanesque churches are located in the northern half of the peninsula, with a number occurring in [[Ávila, Spain|Avila]] which was re-established and fortified around 1100 and Toledo in central Spain from 1098.&lt;ref name= BK178&gt;Toman, ''Romanesque'', Bruno Klein, ''Romanesque architecture in Spain and Portugal, pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many small Pre-Romanesque churches were established in the 10th century with distinctive local characteristics including vaults, horseshoe arches, and rose windows of pierced stone.&lt;ref name =BK178/&gt;
* Many Benedictine monasteries were established in Spain by Italian bishops and abbots, followed by the French orders of Cluniacs and Cistercians.
* In 1032, the church of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll]] was built to a complex plan with double aisles, inspired directly by [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]]. The church set a new standard for architecture in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Klein, pp. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]] began as early as the 9th century, and by the 11th century was drawing pilgrims from England. The [[Way of Saint James]] (Camino de Santiago) was well established by the early 12th century and encouraged the foundation of monasteries along the route.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* Most of the area has abundant building stone, granite, limestone, Red Sandstone and volcanic rubble.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
*There was little timber, so it was used sparingly for roofs.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* The northern part of the region is dotted with numerous small churches such as those of [[Andorra]] and the [[Vall de Boí]] in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.andorra.ad/en-US/suggestions/Pages/art_romanic_andorra.aspx The Romanesque]'', Andorra, the official site, (accessed 13 Aug 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/988/ Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí]'', UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also larger monasteries.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* It is characteristic of both cathedrals and large abbey churches that they have many accretions of different periods,  particularly flanking chapels, in later styles, often Baroque.
* Most churches are built of stone.  In areas where brick is used, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Sahagún]], [[Cuéllar]], the bricks are similar to Roman bricks. The exterior of brick churches, particularly the apses, are decorated with tiers of shallow blind arcading and square-topped niches, as at the churches of San Tirso and San Lorenzo, Sahagún
* Small churches abound across the area, usually having an aisless nave and projecting apse and a bell turret on one gable.
* Larger churches often have a wide turret extending across the upper facade with a gallery of openings holding bells, as at [[Jaca Cathedral]]
* Larger monastic churches often have a short transept and three eastern apses, the larger off the nave and a smaller flanking apse off each transept as at [[La Seu Vella, Lleida]].
* Lateral arcaded porches are a distinctive regional characteristic of small churches.&lt;ref name=Spain1/&gt;  Larger churches sometimes have a similar [[narthex]] at the west as at Santa Maria, Ripoll
* Portals are typically deep set, round topped and with many mouldings, as at [[La Seu Vella, Lleida]], Spain. Portals that are set within porches may be surrounded by rich figurative carvings as at the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]].
* Freestanding towers with increasing openings in each stage, like those of Italy, occur with small churches.
* Small churches are sometimes barrel vaulted and are roofed with stone slabs lying directly on the vault.
* Wider spaces have timber roofs of low profile, as timber was scarce.
* Larger churches such as the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], have barrel vaults, sometimes with transverse arches marking the bays.
* Abbey churches of later French foundation have ribbed vaults.
* Larger monastic churches and cathedrals have nave and aisles and follow French plans, including chevets as at Avila Cathedral.
* The crossing of a large church sometimes has an octagonal tower or dome supported on squinches, as at Santa Maria, Ripoll and the [[Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell]] .
* At the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca]] and the [[Cathedral of Zamora]] there are polygonal crossing domes on pendentives, with narrow windows and with four small corner turrets.
* Externally, many large churches are fortresslike, such as [[Lisbon Cathedral]] and the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]] in Portugal and the [[Sigüenza Cathedral]], Spain
* Rose windows with pierced tracery similar to those that occur in Pre-Romanesque churches of [[Oviedo]] are a feature in some facades, such as that at the Monastery of Santa María de Armenteira, Galicia.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* Much of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands were united under [[Charlemagne]] who built a castle on the Valkhof, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] at Aachen.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* The power of individual bishops and the establishment of cathedrals and monasteries were focused initially in the south of Germany and the Rhineland.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* In the early 10th century Germany and Lombardy were united under Otto the Great, crowned in Charlemagne’s church at Aachen.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Consolidation under Frederick Barbarossa in the 12th century led to the establishment of towns, imperial palaces and churches of imperial patronage.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Despite internal divisions and threats from Poland, Hungary and Denmark, Germany regained power and in the early 13th century Frederick II became Holy Roman Emperor of Germany, Sicily, Lombardy, Burgundy and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Southern Germany, the Rhineland and Belgium had abundant building stone.&lt;ref name=BF570&gt;Banister Fletcher p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saxony and Flanders had little stone, while large parts of the Netherlands and the river plains of northern Germany had none, so that brick was the main building material.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF570/&gt;
* Timber was abundant in Germany and Belgium.&lt;ref name=BF570/&gt;
*The rich fertile river valleys, particularly those of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], encouraged the growth of towns.&lt;ref name=BF353&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp 353-357&lt;/ref&gt;
* The period dating from the 9th to the 13th century produced Romanesque churches.&lt;ref name= BF357&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Several important Early Romanesque churches occur in Saxony at Hildesheim and Gernrode. Many of the most notable examples of Romanesque architecture occur around the Rhineland, with twelve churches of this period in the city of Cologne.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* The most distinctive characteristic of large Romanesque churches is the prevalence of apses at both ends of the church, as on 9th-century [[Plan of St. Gall]], the earliest example being at Gernrode Abbey.  Two reasons are suggested: that the bishop presided at one end and the abbot at the other, or that the western apse served as a baptistery.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;
* The main portal of a double-apsed church is into the side of the building, and may be richly decorated with carving.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;
* Both apses are flanked by paired towers.  Many of the smaller towers are circular, as at [[Worms Cathedral]]. There may be numerous towers of varied shapes and sizes.&lt;ref name= BF363&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 363-364&lt;/ref&gt;
*The crossing is generally surmounted by an octagonal tower, as at [[Speyer Cathedral]].
* Spires are of roofed timber rather than stone and take a variety of forms, the most distinctive being the [[Rhenish helm]].&lt;ref name= BF363/&gt;  Stone is sometimes used for Rhenish helms as at the eastern end of the [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht]].
* The towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey [[Westwerk]]. These latter take a great variety of forms, from a flat façade as at [[Limburg Cathedral]], a flat façade with projecting apse at [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude, Nivelles|St Gertrude, Nivelles]] and a rectangular projecting structure of several storeys that juts beyond the towers as at [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|St Serviatius]], Maastricht.
*The transepts do not project strongly. 
* In the Rhineland, the exterior walls and towers are encircled with courses, [[Lombard bands]] and [[dwarf gallery]]s, which serve to emphasise the individual mass of each component part of the whole, as at [[Speyer Cathedral]].&lt;ref name= BF363/&gt;
* Wheel windows, ocular windows and windows with simple quatrefoil tracery often occur in apses, as at Worms Cathedral.
* Wooden roofs were common, with an ancient painted ceiling retained at [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St Michael’s, Hildesheim]].
* Stone vaults were used at a later date than in France, occurring over the aisles at Speyer in about 1060.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
*Norway, Sweden and Denmark were separate kingdoms for much of the period.
*Much of Norway was united from the late 9th century until 1387 under [[Harold I of Norway|Harold I]] and his successors.
* [[Cnut the Great]] briefly united Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden in the early 11th century.
*King [[Olaf II of Norway]], known as St Olav, did much to enforce Christianity on the Vikings, and by the end of the 11th Century, Christianity was the only legal religion.
* In Denmark, Christianity was promoted by [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] in the late 11th century, with [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] dividing the country into eight dioceses, and establishing many churches, cathedrals and monasteries from about 1060 onwards.
* Much of Sweden was united under [[Olof Skötkonung|Olaf Eiríksson]] around 995, with the southern area, Götaland being united with Svealand by [[Sverker I of Sweden]] in the 1130s.
* [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden, was made the seat of the archbishop for all of Scandinavia in 1103, but only the crypt remains from the 1130s, the rest being mostly 19th century rebuilding.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Bishop Absalon founded Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark in 1158 and the city of Copenhagen (1160–67).
* Architectural influences came with clergy brought from England (such as [[Nicholas Breakspeare]]), Lombardy and Germany.  The influence of English Norman architecture is seen particularly in Norway at [[Nidaros Cathedral]], Trondheim, and of German Romanesque at [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Benedictine monks from Italy introduced the skill of firing bricks to Denmark.
* While most churches were initially built of timber, the larger ones were replaced by stone, with brick being the dominant material in much of Denmark where building stone is scarce.
* Small Romanesque churches are plentiful and are generally in relatively unchanged condition. Large churches are rare and are much altered as at [[Aarhus Cathedral]], [[Lund Cathedral]] and [[Roskilde Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Norway has 25 wooden stave churches from this period,&lt;ref name=HW/&gt; making up all but three of the world’s medieval wooden churches. 
* In Sweden, surviving Romanesque churches are concentrated mainly but not exclusively to three provinces: [[Gotland]], [[Scania]] and [[Västra Götaland]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* The wooden [[stave church]]es of Norway represent a type that was once common across Northern Europe, but elsewhere have been destroyed or replaced.  They have timber frames, walls of planks, and shingled roofs which are steeply pitched and overhanging to protect the joints of the building from the weather.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{harvnb|Wischermann|1997a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Denmark has seven rotunda churches, which have a circular nave, divided into several storeys internally, and have projecting chancel and apse as at [[Bjernede Church]] and [[List of churches on Bornholm|Nylars Church]].&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;   At [[Østerlars Church]], the chancel and apse are constructed as small intersecting circles.  Rotunda churches also occur in Sweden as at [[Hagby]] Church.
* Bulky west towers with stepped gables are typical of Denmark and are found on smaller churches as at [[Horne Church]], [[Søborg, Gribskov Municipality|Søborg]] Church, and [[Aa Church]], Bornholm where the tower has paired crow-step gables at each side.
* In Denmark the west tower may extend across the whole width of the church, forming a westwerk as at [[Aa Church]] and Hvidbjerg Church, [[Mors (island)|Morsø]], with some such towers incorporating a large open archway with stairs such as at Torrild Church.
*Small stone churches in Norway and Sweden have a short wide nave, square chancel, an apse and a western tower with pyramidal shingled spire, as at Hove Church, Norway and Kinneveds Church and [[Helena of Skövde|Våmbs Church]], Sweden.
* Large central towers occur in Norway, as at [[Old Aker Church]].
* Free standing belltowers are found, often with half-timbered upper sections.
* Stone churches, such as Aa Church, Denmark and [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden, have Lombard bands and paired windows, similar to churches of Lombardy and Germany.
* Openings are generally small and simple.  Many doors have a carved tympanum as at [[Vestervig Church]] and [[Ribe Cathedral]], Denmark
* Most churches have timber roofed naves, but ribbed vaulting over smaller spaces such as the chancel is common.  Some small churches, such as [[Falköping|Marka Church]] in Sweden, have groin vaults.  Larger churches such as [[Ribe Cathedral]] are vaulted.
* Arcades may be of simple rectangular piers such as at Ribe, Denmark, or drum columns such as at [[Stavanger Cathedral]], Norway. [[Lund Cathedral]] has alternating rectangular piers and piers with attached shafts which support the vault.
* Fully developed Romanesque arcades of three stages occur in churches built under English or German influence as at [[Nidaros Cathedral]], Trondheim.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Large churches may have paired towers at the western end, as at [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|Mariakirken]], Bergen.
* [[Visby Cathedral]] and [[Husaby Church]], Sweden, have tall westwerks, framed by round towers. At [[Ribe Cathedral]] the stone westwerk is framed on the south by a Romanesque tower of German form with a Rhenish helm spire and on the north by a taller Gothic tower in red brick.

*  Poland became Christian under [[Mieszko I]] in 966, resulting in the foundation of the first [[Pre-Romanesque]] churches, including [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Kraków, [[Gniezno Cathedral|Gniezno]] and [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań]] Cathedrals.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* During the period 976–1248 Austria was ruled by margraves of the [[House of Babenberg]]. Towns and monasteries were established.
* The Romanesque style was introduced to Poland from Germany with the founding of the bishopric of Gniezno in 1000.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* In Hungary, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] brought the Magyar states together in 1001 and created two Catholic archbishoprics.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;

===Characteristics===
* There are a number of surviving small rotunda churches, generally with an apse as at Öskü, Hungary and [[Culture of medieval Poland|Saint Nicholas Rotunda]] in Cieszyn, Poland.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
*  Rotunda churches sometimes have towers which may be circular as at [[Culture of medieval Poland|Saint Procopius Church]], Strzelno, Poland or square in plan as at the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Budeč]], Czech Republic.
* Other small churches found in the region are rectangular, aisleless and with a square chancel,&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt; or an apse as at the [[Hrusice#Sights|Church of Saint Wenceslas, Hrusice]], Czech Republic. [[Schöngrabern]] Church, Austria, has a square chancel and projecting apse.
* Larger churches have a nave and aisles, each ending in an apse, and with no transept.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;  Examples are [[Pécs|Pécs Cathedral]], [[Ják#Ják Church|Ják Church]] and the Basilica of the Assumption, [[Tismice]], Czech Republic.
* The aisles sometimes contained galleries for the nobility.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* While arcades are usually supported on piers, the Basilica of the Assumption, [[Tismice]] has alternating piers and columns which have [[cushion capital]]s.
* Larger churches have paired western towers, some with decorated central portals, as at [[Ják#Ják Church|Ják Church]] and the ruined [[Zsámbék Premontre monastery church|Zsambek Church]], Hungary.
* At [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków]], the unornamented facade takes the form of westwerk, with an octagonal towers rising on either side. [[Gurk Cathedral]], Austria,  has a similarly flat facade, rising to two very tall square towers.
* The [[Collegiate church in Tum|Collegiate Church at Tum]] has and apse at either end, similar to many German Romanesque churches.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt; The western apse is flanked by square towers.
* Pecs Cathedral, Hungary, has four towers of square plan, like [[Bamberg Cathedral]], Germany.
* Tower openings take the typical Romanesque paired form as at [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Budeč]] Czech Republic.
* Roofs are generally of wood, with vaults occurring
* Lombard bands are used, as at [[Schöngrabern]] Church, Austria, and around the towers of Tum and Ják churches.
* The facade of [[Sulejów Abbey]] Church, founded by the [[Cistercians]], and having a gabled portal and rose window, heralds the influence of French architectural style that was to introduce Gothic.

[[File:Salamander from The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century image of a salamander from ''the Book of Lambspring'']]
The '''[[salamander]]''' is an [[amphibian]] of the order [[Salamander|Urodela]] which, as with many real creatures, often has been ascribed fantastic and sometimes [[occult]] qualities by pre-modern authors (as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[bestiary|bestiaries]]) not possessed by the real organism. The legendary salamander is often depicted as a typical salamander in shape, with a [[lizard]]-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with [[fire]], sometimes specifically [[Fire (classical element)|elemental fire]].

==Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance lore==
This legendary creature embodies the fantastic qualities that ancient and medieval commentators ascribed to the natural [[salamander]]. Many of these qualities are rooted in verifiable traits of the natural creature but often exaggerated. A large body of [[legend]], [[mythology]], and [[symbol]]ism has developed around this creature over the centuries.

===Classical lore: Pliny, the Talmud, and Augustine===
In one of the earliest surviving descriptions of a salamander, [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE) noted that the creature is ''"an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body specked all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear."''&lt;ref&gt;"sicut salamandrae, animal lacertae figura, stellatum, numquam nisi magnis imbribus proveniens et serenitate desinens"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]], eds., London: Taylor and Francis, 1855. Translation slightly modified.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the [[Salamandra atra aurorae|golden Alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra aurorae'') of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back&lt;ref name="van der Meijden"&gt;*{{cite web |url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=atra |title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra atra'' |author=Arie van der Meijden |date=1999-12-30 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some similarly marked subspecies of the [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'').&lt;ref name="Kuzmin"&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=salamandra|title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra salamandra''|author=Sergius L. Kuzmin|date=1999-10-06}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when [[Biology|biologists]] [[Scientific classification|classified]] lizards as [[reptile]]s and salamanders as amphibians.

Pliny recounts several other traits which are less credible, such as the ability to extinguish fire with the frigidity of their bodies, a quality which was reported as hearsay by [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Ch. XVII, Sec. 13 in the Cresswell translation&lt;/ref&gt; While Pliny notes this in Book 10, Chapter 86 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', in Book 29, Chapter 23 of the same work he views this idea with skepticism, pointing out that if such an idea were true, it should be easy to demonstrate.

Pliny also notes medicinal and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since many species of salamander, including fire salamanders and Alpine salamanders, excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which has the effect of deterring predators.&lt;ref name="van der Meijden" /&gt; The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book | author=White, T. H. |authorlink=T. H. White |title=The Book of Beasts: Being a Translation From a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century |year=1992 |origyear=1954 |pages= 183–184 |publisher=[[Alan Sutton]] |location=Stroud |isbn=978-0-7509-0206-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salamander is also mentioned in the [[Talmud]] (Hagiga 27a) as a creature that is a product of fire, and it relates that anyone who is smeared with its blood will be immune to harm from fire. [[Rashi]] (1040–1105), the primary commentator on the Talmud, describes the salamander as one which is produced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://independent.academia.edu/RudolphKlein/Papers/1223468/Salamandra_and_the_Flames_of_Hell Salamandra and the Flames of Hell]" by Reb Chaim HaQoton&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Saint Augustine]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' used the example of salamanders to argue for the possibility of humans being punished by being burned in eternal flame in [[Purgatory]]. He wrote "If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|page=454 (Book 21, Ch. 4)|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102|author=Augustine of Hippo|editor=Philip Schaff|language=English, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy,'' (original publisher unclear-see [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/] for on-line text), (1928).&lt;/ref&gt; This illustration appears to originate in a 1527 anti-papal tract by [[Andreas Osiander]] and [[Hans Sachs]], where it is identified as "the Pope as a monster".&lt;ref&gt;Renate Freitag-Stadler and Erhard Schön, ''Die Welt des Hans Sachs,'' City History Museum of Nuremberg, 1976, p. 24 (Kat. 25/15)&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with Paracelsus derives from his ''Auslegung der Magischen Figuren im Carthäuser Kloster zu Nũrnberg''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hohenheim (Paracelsus)|first=Theophrastus|title=Bücher und Schriften: Adiunctus est Index rerum et verborum accuratiß.

Catholic Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer (1862–1945) explained that the set of woodcuts it belongs to was commissioned by Osiander based on some old "pope illustrations" found at the monastery, which Netzhammer thought may have dated back to the time of [[Joachim of Fiore]] (d. 1202) and were intended as cartoons mocking the Pope and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Netzhammer|first=Raymund|title=Theophrastus Paracelsus: das wissenswerteste über leben, lehre und schriften des berühmten Einsiedler arztes|date=1900|publisher=Benziger|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aP0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;pg=RA1-PA4#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the legendary form are more likely to use stylized depictions. In Medieval European bestiaries, fanciful depictions of salamanders include "a satyr-like creature in a circular wooden tub" (8th century), "a worm penetrating flames" (12th century), "a winged dog" (13th century), and "a small bird in flames" (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;Florence McCulloch, ''Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962, pp.161–162&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Renaissance lore: Europe===
[[File:Salamander cartouche of Francois 1 at Azay-le-Rideau.jpg|thumb|Salamander as the animal emblem of King [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Château d'Azay-le-Rideau]], Vienne, France]]

Compared to Medieval depictions, [[Renaissance]] depictions&lt;ref name="prod"&gt;[http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html Conrad Lycosthenes, ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon,'' 1557] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105012/http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html |date=2007-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are characteristically more realistic, adhering more closely to the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] description. In another example, a 1556 edition of the ''Book of Lambspring'' depicts the salamander as a white bird,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Lambspring|url=http://www.compendiumnaturalis.net/the-book-of-lambspring-1556/|website=Compendium Naturalis|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lucas Jennis]]' 1625 version of the same illustration, included in the ''[[Musaeum Hermeticum]]'', depicts it as a lizard-like animal with star-like markings (see right).

Of all the traits ascribed to salamanders, the ones relating to fire have stood out most prominently. This connection probably originates from a behavior common to many species of salamander: hibernating in and under rotting logs. When wood was brought indoors and put on the fire, the creatures "mysteriously" appeared from the flames. The 16th-century Italian artist [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) famously recalled witnessing just such an appearance as a child in his autobiography.&lt;ref name="bullfinch"&gt;[[Thomas Bulfinch]] (1913). ''Age of Fable: Vols. I &amp; II: Stories of Gods and Heroes'': [http://www.bartleby.com/181/365.html XXXVI. e. The Salamander]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some writers, the milky substance that a salamander exudes when frightened and which makes its skin moist gave rise to the idea that the salamander could withstand any heat and even put out fires.&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"&gt;{{cite book | author=Friar, Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Friar |title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry |year=1987 |pages= 300 |publisher=Alphabooks/[[A &amp; C Black]]
|location=London |isbn=978-0-906670-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea which is found in several Medieval and Renaissance works was that "Egyptian priests" used a [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] which applied the figure of a salamander to represent a man who is burnt, or in other versions a man who has died from cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/article-33035010.html |title=Question : Salamandre et hiéroglyphes ? |author=Eric Desrentes |work=hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/ |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=2 September 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is first found in the ''Hieroglyphica'' of [[Horapollo]] (Book 2, Ch. LXII), but it is not now considered to be an authentic representation of hieroglyphic usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browne|first=Thomas|title=Pseudodoxia Epidemica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo314.html#note1|accessdate=1 March 2014|author2=James Eason |page=314 (note 1)|date=1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early commentators in Europe often grouped "crawling things" (''reptiles'' or ''reptilia'' in Latin) together, and thus creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin ''salamandrae''), [[European dragon|dragons]] (Latin ''dracones'' or ''serpentes''), and [[basilisk]]s (Latin ''basilisci''), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon'' of 1557.&lt;ref name="prod"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) wrote the following on the salamander: ''"This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in which it constantly renews its scaly skin. The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,—for virtue."''&lt;ref&gt;''Book XX: Humorous Writings'', ''The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci'', edited by Jean Paul Richter, 1880. ([http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo/section-20/item-1236.html online]) (unconfirmed)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) suggested that the salamander was the [[elemental]] of [[fire (classical element)|fire]],&lt;ref name=Paracelsus&gt;Theophrast von Hohenheim a.k.a. Paracelsus, ''Sämtliche Werke: Abt. 1, v. 14, sec. 7, Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus.'' [[Karl Sudhoff]] and Wilh. Matthießen, eds. Munich:Oldenbourg, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; which has had substantial influence on the role of salamanders in the occult. Paracelsus, contrary to the prevalent view of the time, considered them to be not devils but similar to humans — only lacking souls (along with giants, dwarves, mermaids, elves, and elemental spirits in human form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Treatises of Theophrastus Von Hohenheim Called Paracelsus |date=1941 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |page=221 ff |author=Paracelsus |editor1=Sigerist, H.E |editor2=Temkin, C.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis I of France]] used the salamander as his symbol.

The salamander is found throughout French folklore, although in differing form. In addition or sometimes instead of its fire symbolism, it was attributed a powerful poison. Some legends say that merely by falling into a well, it would poison the water, and by climbing a fruit tree, poison the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Les animaux du Moyen Âge réels et mythiques | publisher = Autres temps | author = Josy Marty-Dufaut| year = 2005 | isbn = 978-2845211650|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highly toxic breath was reportedly enough to swell a person until their skin broke; in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], it supposedly did the same to herds of cattle. This gained it the name of "bellows breath". Like the real animal, the legendary salamander breathed seldom; unlike the real salamander, the only way to kill one was said to be to lock it in a confined space so that it breathed its own poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Brasey, Édouard |  title=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux| publisher=[[Éditions le pré aux clercs]] | place=Paris | date =14 September 2007 | pages=161–162| isbn=978-2842283216|  title-link=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bretons feared it so they did not dare say its real name for fear it would hear and then kill them.

===Renaissance: Asian garments===
Early travelers to [[China]] were shown garments supposedly woven from salamander hair or wool; the cloth was completely unharmed by fire. The garments had actually been [[weaving|woven]] from [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clare Browne, "Salamander's Wool: The Historical Evidence for Textiles Woven with Asbestos Fibre", ''[[Textile History]]'', Volume 34, Number 1, May 2003, pp. 64–73(10) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/tex/2003/00000034/00000001/art00008 (abstract)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to T. H. White, [[Prester John]] had a robe made from it; the "Emperor of India" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; and [[Pope Alexander III]] had a tunic which he valued highly.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; [[William Caxton]] (1481) wrote: ''"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre."''&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; 
Holme (1688) wrote: ''"...I have several times put [salamander hair] in the Fire and made it red hot and after taken it out, which being cold, yet remained perfect wool."''&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"/&gt;

An alternative interpretation was that this material was a kind of [[silk]]: A 12th-century letter supposedly from Prester John says, ''"Our realm yields the worm known as the salamander. Salamanders live in fire and make [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]], which our court ladies spin and use to weave cloth and garments. To wash and clean these fabrics, they throw them into flames."''&lt;ref name="borges"&gt;{{cite book | author=Borges, Jorge Luis
|authorlink=Jorge Luis Borges |title=El libro de los seres imaginarios (The Book of Imaginary Beings) 
|year=1969|origyear= 1967; English language edition 1969 | page= |title-link=The Book of Imaginary Beings }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friar also notes that [[Marco Polo]] believed that the "true" salamander was an incombustible substance found in the earth.&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt;

==Newts in witchcraft==
A [[newt]] is a type of salamander, and they are traditionally associated with [[witchcraft]]. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play ''[[Macbeth]]'', the [[Three Witches|witches]] use the "eye of newt" as the first ingredient stirred in their [[cauldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eye of Newt and Toe of Frog, Adder's Fork and Lizard's Leg: The Lore and Mythology of Amphibians and Reptiles|last=Crump|first=Marty|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780226116006|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENYpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the famous line in ''Macbeth'' is actually referring to a series of plants. Eye of newt refers to mustard, which reiterates the link between salamanders and fire as mustard seeds are used as a "fiery" spice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/is-eye-of-newt-real-thing.htm|title=Is eye of newt a real thing?|author=|date=13 July 2015|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''serdab''' ({{lang-fa|سرداب|d=Sardāb}}), literally meaning "cold water", which became a loanword in Arabic for 'cellar') is an [[ancient Egyptian tomb]] structure that served as a chamber for the [[Ka statue]] of a deceased individual. Used during the [[Old Kingdom]], the serdab was a sealed chamber with a small slit or hole to allow the soul of the deceased to move about freely. These holes  also let in the smells of the offerings presented to the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = KA | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | location = NY, NY | year = 1999|isbn=0-415-18589-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word serdab is also used for a type of undecorated chamber found in many pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Billing, Egyptens pyramider, 2009. Page 236&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of inscriptions, it has been impossible to determine the ritual function of this chamber, but many egyptologists view it as a storage space, akin with the underground storehouses in private and royal tombs of the second dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Ägypten Die Welt der Pharaonen, 1998. Pages 68&lt;/ref&gt; It is easiest recognized by its position in the east end of the pyramid's internal chamber system and the three niches in its outer wall.
The earliest serdab of this type is found in the [[pyramid of Menkaure]], but it was during the reign of [[Djedkare Isesi]] that it became a part of the standard pyramid layout. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John.jpg|thumb|620px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St John Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel, each frame 77 x 48cm. [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

The '''''St John Altarpiece''''' (German - ''Johannesaltar'', ''Johannestafel'' or ''Johannesretabel'') is a c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The triptych is linked to the artist's earlier ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' in its symbolic motifs, format and intention.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Acres, 422-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels show – from left to right – the birth of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the baptism of Christ by John in [[Jordan]], and the [[beheading of St. John the Baptist|beheading of John]], with the rather attractive [[Salome]] receiving the disembodied head on a plate. Each panel is set within painted [[archivolt]]s, which contain painted reliefs depicting statuettes of the apostles,&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;Reed, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and scenes from the lives of both Christ and John, with the overall theme of salvation. The faux sculptural reliefs are painted in [[grisaille]], and give the impression that the scenes are set within a church.&lt;ref name="j92"&gt;Jacobs, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two extant versions of the altarpiece, almost equal in size, leading to complexities in establishing attribution and authenticity. The version in Berlin is considered the original, that in Frankfurt a near contemporary copy.

==Description==
The three panels describe the major events in John's life: his birth, baptism of Christ, and his decapitation at the hands of Salome. The reliefs in the archivolts detail secondary events from his life. The overall theme is of the [[sacrament]]s, each panel can be associated with a specific [[liturgical]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="l655"&gt;Lane, 655&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six archivolt scenes, four detail scenes of Mary's life, including the "Marriage of the Virgin", the "Annunciation" and the "Birth of Christ".&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;Reed, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of John===

The archivolts of this panel show the angel appearing to John's father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], in the temple. According to Luke 1:12–17, an angel of the Lord had earlier appeared and announced to Zechariah that his wife would give birth to a son, whom he was to name John, and that this son would be the forerunner of the Lord. Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign so he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as Gabriel, sent by God, and stated that because of Zechariah's doubt he would be struck dumb and "not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed". This punishment of muteness is referred to in the archivolt reliefs.&lt;ref name="l659"&gt;Lane, 659&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist Petites Heures du Duc de Berry.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist'', before 1388, [[Petites Heures de Jean de Berry]], Folio 207r]]
Zacharias appears in the main panel sitting in the foreground with a pen and scroll. To his right, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] presents his son to him. By including the Virgin, Rogier strays from the Gospel account of the scene, referring instead to the apocryphal version popularised by the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and the ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'', both of which have Mary presenting the child John. [[Erwin Panofsky]] suggests that Rogier might have been influenced by [[Andrea Pisano]]'s relief ''The Naming of the Baptist'' at the [[Florence Baptistery]], which shows a similar scene of Mary presenting to Zechariah, who sits holding a pen and scroll.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt;

===Baptism of Christ===
In the central panel John can be identified by his red robe.&lt;ref&gt;Soudavar, 66&lt;/ref&gt; This panel shows the apparition of God in the sky above painted in red hues, from which emanates a curved Latin script, above a dove. The panels are typical of the harmony and unity characteristic of Rogier; especially in the manner in which the figures echo each other. This is most evident in the figure of the woman in the birth panel, who occupies the same space and resembles Salome to the far right.

Christ stands fully frontal to the viewer, positioned in a stream with water rising to just below his knees. To his right John blesses him, with his hand raised over Christ's head. [[God the Father]] is shown ascending from the clouds. He sends down a dove to bless the occasion.  The dove is accompanied by, in art historian Barbara Lane's words, a "gracefully curving inscription" taken from Matthew 17:5, which reads "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."&lt;ref name="l656"&gt;Lane, 656&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the baptism is where Jesus is first presented as the son of God, his divinity first revealed to the world, here symbolised by the ascendance of the dove and God's words.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of John===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail; Salome receives John's severed head on a platter]]
The right hand panel is unusually dramatic and also deviates from the Gospel account. Instead of a prison setting, the scene is shown in a domestic interior.&lt;ref name="l662"&gt;Lane, 662&lt;/ref&gt; In most depictions, Salome holds an empty charger; here the head has been placed on the charger.&lt;ref name="l663"&gt;Lane, 663&lt;/ref&gt; John's limp body lies at the foot of the stairs, blood pumping from the neck, as the executioner, still holding his sword, hands the head to Salome on a golden [[Horses in warfare|charger]]. Salome, according to Lane, "demurely averts her glance", as does the executioner, who turns right to look out of a large window. In the background, she is shown presenting the head to her mother, the Judaean princess [[Herodias]], at what appears to be the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist|Feast of Herod]].&lt;ref name="l662" /&gt;

[[File:Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Limbourg brothers]], ''Salome Presents the Head of John the Baptist at the Banquet of Herod'', 1405–1408-09. [[Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry]], fol. 212v]]

Salome is painted to the late Gothic ideal, with narrow shoulders, thin frame and generic idealised face. She wears a headdress, and blue dress, with white lining and green under-sleeves.

In the panel, Rogier makes reference to the [[Communion (Christian)|Communion]], in that John's head "signifies the body of Christ which feeds us on the
holy altar". Lane writes that "Salome's charger&amp;nbsp;... apparently corresponds to the golden paten on which the Host is placed during the sacrifice of the Mass."&lt;ref name="l663" /&gt; Art historian Victoria Reed agrees with this analysis, noting that John's head has become a eucharistic symbol, and that "by receiving it, Salome takes the part of the Christian communicant." She observes that the charger resembles a [[paten]], while the sleeves of Salome's dress are "reminiscent of a liturgical cloth with which to bear the sacrament."&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;Reed, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The work was commissioned by Battista Agnelli, a merchant from [[Pisa]], for Saint James's Church, [[Bruges]]. It is smaller than van der Weyden's other altarpieces, and probably intended as a side altarpiece or private devotional object. The frames are mounted together and cannot fold inwards. Therefore, it is not a triptych, but a purpose designed [[altarpiece]]. It is thought to have been commissioned by a Spanish donor; there is compelling evidence that it is the same work described in a Carthusian monastery of [[Monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas|Santa Maria de las Cuevas]], in [[Seville]]. José Martín Rincón, in 1744 wrote of a "portable oratory" showing the Baptism of Christ, flanked by scenes of John's birth, and beheading, though he attributed [[Albrecht Dürer]]. In 1778 the Spanish historian [[Antonio Ponz]]  mentioned the same altarpiece, noting that "each one of the scenes is included within two pilasters and an arch".&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Reed, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
Panofsky dates the altarpiece to after 1450, based on the similarity of the left hand panel to Andrea Pisano's relief; Rogier may have seen it during his visit to Italy that year.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt; Dendrochronological examination dates the wood as ready for use as a panel painting at about 1454.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Most art historians see the altarpiece as inextricably linked with the ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', thus associating it with van der Weyden. Panofsky described them as "almost indistinguishable" in style and quality.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Later Shirley Blum wrote that "the two altarpieces are as alike formally as they are in devotional character&amp;nbsp;... one should examine more closely the possibility that they originally came from the same place". Victoria Reed believes the similarities so pronounced that it is highly probable that the two were intended to hang together at the Miraflores monastery.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Reed, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Guthrie - Statesmen of World War I.jpg|thumb|300px| Sir [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], ''Statesmen of World War I'', 1930, [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]

'''''Statesmen of World War I''''' is an oil on canvas painting by Sir [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], completed in 1930, shortly before Guthrie's death.  It was commissioned by South African financier Sir [[Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet]] to commemorate the politicians and statesmen of Britain and its allies who held office during the First World War.  It was donated to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1930, shortly after it was completed.

==Background==
Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, ''[[General Officers of World War I]]'' (originally entitled ''Some General Officers of the Great War'') by [[John Singer Sargent]], and ''[[Naval Officers of World War I]]'' by Sir [[Arthur Stockdale Cope]]. Bailey paid £5,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].  The third painting, of statesmen, was first offered to Sir [[William Orpen]], but Orpen declined as he had already been commissioned as the official British artist of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] (see, for example, ''[[The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors]]'').  Sargent suggested Guthrie instead.

As preparatory work, Guthrie painted a study of each subject separately, considerably delaying the process.  He held sittings in the springs and early summers of 1919 to 1921.  After a delay caused by Guthrie's illness, the work was first exhibited at the [[Scottish National Gallery]] in Edinburgh in early 1930.  Guthrie died in September 1930 before he could complete the final finishing touches before it went on display in London in October 1930.  His 17 oil studies and an oil sketch of the composition were donated to [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]].  Guthrie's study of Louis Botha was used by Sargent in making his painting of general officers.

==Painting==
The work measures {{convert|156|xx|132|in|cm}}.  It is a group portrait of seventeen figures, some seated and some standing.  Unlike the companion paintings by Sargent and Cope, which adopt landscape format to accommodate the many subjects, Guthrie used a portrait format.  The subjects are depicted as if in conference around a table in a large hall, in the shadow of a sculpture based on the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], with Doric columns to either side and coffered vault above.

The individuals depicted are, from left to right, starting with those seated on the left side of the table:
* Sir [[Joseph Cook]], former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (1913–14), [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)]] (1914–1916), [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for the Navy]] (1917–20) (with beard)
* [[Billy Hughes]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (1915–23) (head resting on hand)
* [[David Lloyd George]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1908–1915),  [[Minister of Munitions]] (1915–1916),  [[Secretary of State for War]] (1916), [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1916–1922)
* [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner]], [[Secretary of State for War]] (1918–19) (leaning forward)
* [[William Massey]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] (1912–25) (seated facing away)
* Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911–15), [[Minister of Munitions]] (1917–19) (later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], 1940–45 and 1951–55) (illuminated)
* [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] (1905–16) (in profile with aquiline nose)

Standing behind Lloyd George are:
* [[Ganga Singh]], [[History of Bikaner|Maharaja of Bikaner]], only "non-White" member of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]]
* [[Louis Botha]], [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa]] (1910–19)

Behind Churchill are: 
* [[George Nicoll Barnes]], leader of the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]]
* Sir [[Robert Borden]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]] (1911–20) 

To their right are:
* [[Arthur Balfour]], 1st Earl of Balfour, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1902-05); [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1915–16) and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] (1916–19) (standing [[adlocutio]] in a black suit)
* [[H. H. Asquith]], 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1908–16) (sitting in front)
* Sir [[Eric Campbell Geddes]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1917–19) (behind, cleanshaven)
* [[Bonar Law]], [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)]] (1911–15), [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] (1915–16), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1916–19) (later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], 1922–23) (dark moustache)
* [[Edward Morris, 1st Baron Morris]], [[Prime Minister of Newfoundland]] (1909–17) (white moustache, in the shadows)
* [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener]], [[Secretary of State for War]] (1914–1916) (in the shadows)

Bailey decided that the painting should include British and Dominion civilian leaders in office at the beginning and the end of the First World War.  It includes Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, and New Zealand, and the Prime Ministers, Foreign Secretaries, Secretaries of War, and First Lords of the Admiralty of the United Kingdom, together with two leaders of the British Conservative and Labour parties.  The [[Maharaja of Bikaner]], a member of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] and the Indian delegate to the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], stands to the left next to Louis Botha, both in military uniform.

[[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|General Kitchener]] stands in military uniform on the far right, away from the others with his profile in deep shadow.  Kitchener died in the sinking of [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']] in 1916, so this portrait was posthumous.

==History==

===Early exhibitors===

In 1897, M. Edwards first screened a selection of silent short films at the [[Victoria Public Hall]] in [[Chennai|Madras]]. The films all featured non-fictional subjects; they were mostly photographed records of day-to-day events. The film scholar Stephen Hughes points out that within a few years there were regular ticketed shows in a hall in Pophams Broadway, started by one Mrs. Klug, but this lasted only for a few months. Once it was demonstrated as a commercial proposition, a Western entrepreneur, Warwick Major, built the first cinema theatre, the Electric Theatre, which still stands. It was a favourite haunt of the British community in Madras. The theatre was shut down after a few years. This building is now part of a post office complex on [[Anna Salai]] ([[Mount Road]]). The ''Lyric Theatre'' was also built in the Mount Road area. This venue boasted a variety of events, including plays in English, [[Western culture|Western]] classical music concerts, and [[ballroom]] dances. Silent films were also screened as an additional attraction.&lt;ref name="folklore"&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore, public sphere, and civil society|page=116

To celebrate the event of [[George V|King George V]]'s visit in 1909, a grand [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] was organized in [[Chennai|Madras]]. Its major attraction was the screening of short films accompanied by sound. A British company imported a Crone [[megaphone]], made up of a film projector to which a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] with a disc containing prerecorded sound was linked, and both were run in unison, producing picture and sound simultaneously. However, there was no synched [[dialogue]]. Raghupathy Venkiah Naidu, a successful photographer, took over the equipment after the exhibition and set up a tent cinema near the [[Madras High Court]].&lt;ref name="folklore"/&gt; With this equipment, he screened the short films ''Pearl Fish'' and ''Raja's Casket'' in the Victoria Public Hall. When this proved successful, he screened the films in a tent set up in Esplanade. These tent events were the true precursors of the cinema shows. Venkiah traveled with this unit to Burma (now Myanmar) and Sri Lanka, and when he had gathered enough money, he put up a permanent cinema house in Madras—Gaiety, in 1914, the first cinema house in Madras to be built by an Indian. He soon added two more, Crown Theatre in Mint and Globe (later called Roxy) in Purasawalkam.

Swamikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of [[South India]] in [[Coimbatore]], introduced the concept of "Tent Cinema" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first of its kind was established in [[Chennai|Madras]], called "Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone". This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2010/04/30/stories/2010043051340400.htm|title=He brought cinema to South|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=26 September 2011|location=Chennai, India|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the films screened then were shorts made in the United States and Britain. In 1909, an Englishman, T. H. Huffton, founded Peninsular Film Services in Madras and produced some short films for local audiences. But soon, hour-long films, which narrated dramatic stories, then known as "drama films", were imported. From 1912 onwards, feature films made in Bombay (now Mumbai) were also screened in Madras. The era of short films had ended. The arrival of drama films firmly established cinema as a popular entertainment form. More cinema houses came up in the city.

Fascinated by this new entertainment form, an automobile dealer in the Thousand Lights area of Madras, R. Nataraja Mudaliyar, decided to venture into film production. After a few days’ training in Pune with the cinematographer Stewart Smith, the official cinematographer of Lord Curzon’s 1903 Durbar, he started a film production concern in 1916.

The man who truly laid the foundations of south Indian cinema was A. Narayanan. After a few years in film distribution, he set up a production company in Madras, the General Pictures Corporation, popularly known as GPC. Beginning with ''The Faithful Wife''/''Dharmapathini'' (1929), GPC made about 24 feature films. GPC functioned as a film school and its alumni included names such as Sundara Rao Nadkarni and Jiten Banerji. The studio of GPC was housed in the Chellapalli bungalow on Thiruvottiyur High Road in Madras. This company, which produced the most number of Tamil silent films, had branches in Colombo, Rangoon and Singapore.

''The Ways of Vishnu''/''Vishnu Leela'', which R. Prakasa made in 1932, was the last silent film produced in Madras. Unfortunately, the silent era of south Indian cinema has not been documented well. When the talkies appeared, film producers had to travel to Bombay or Calcutta to make films. Most films of this early period were celluloid versions of well-known stage plays. Company dramas were popular among the Madras audience. The legendary Otraivadai drama theatre had been built in 1872 itself in Mint. Many drama halls had come up in the city where short silent films were screened in the afternoon and plays were enacted in the night.

The scene changed in 1934 when Madras got its first sound studio. By this time, all the cinema houses in Madras had been wired for sound. Narayanan, who had been active during the silent era, founded Srinivasa Cinetone in which his wife worked as the sound recordist. ''Srinivasa Kalyanam'' (1934), directed by Narayanan, was the first sound film (talkie) produced in Madras. The second sound studio to come up in Madras was Vel Pictures, started by M. D. Rajan on Eldams Road in the Dunmore bungalow, which belonged to the Raja of Pithapuram. Before long, more sound studios came up. Thirty-six talkies were made in Madras in 1935.

===Influences===
The main impacts of the early cinema were the cultural influences of the country. The [[Tamil language]] was the medium in which many plays and stories were written since the ages as early as the [[Cholas]]. They were highly stylised and nature of the spectacle was one which could attract the people. Along with this, music and dance were one of the main entertainment sources.&lt;ref name="IndiaGlitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/64835.html |title=Abhinay Deo – "All stories can be found in Mahabharata and Ramayana" – Bollywood Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, [[fairy tale]]s and so on through song and dance. Whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day-to-day lives in complex ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theviewspaper.net/indian-films-vs-hollywood-2/ |title=Indian Films vs Hollywood |publisher=Theviewspaper.net|date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s, the State of Madras legislature passed the ''Entertainment Tax Act 1939''.

===Studios===
In the year 1916 a studio, the first in south India, was set up in Madras at 10 Millers Road, Kilpauk. He called it the India Film Company. Rangavadivelu, an actor from Suguna Vilasa Sabha, a theatre company then, was hired to train the actors. Thirty-five days later, the first feature film made in south India, The Extermination of Keechakan/Keechakavatham, based on an episode from the Mahabharata, was released produced and directed by R. Nataraja, who established the ''India Film Company Limited'' (''The Destruction of Keechaka'').&lt;ref name=tcp&gt;{{cite book | title= Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65Aqrna4o5oC&amp;dq=Tamil+cinema| last=Velayutham|first=Selvaraj|chapter='India' in Tamil silent era cinema| year=2008| page=156| publisher=Routledge|location=| isbn=978-0-415-39680-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a century of increasing box office takings, Tamil cinema remains informal and dominated by shell companies, or one-film wonders, born and dead in a matter of months. Nevertheless, there are few exceptions like Modern Theatres, Gemini Studios, AVM and Sri Thenandal Films that survived beyond 100 productions.

Annual admissions in Chennai multiplexes and single screens averaged 11 million tickets with a standard deviation of ±1 million tickets during 2011-16.

Many successful Tamil films have been remade by other film industries. It is estimated by the ''Manorama Yearbook 2000'' (a popular almanac) that over 5,000 Tamil films were produced in the 20th century. Tamil films have also been dubbed into other languages, thus reaching a much wider audience. There has been a growing presence of English in dialogue and songs in Chennai films. It is not uncommon to see movies that feature dialogue studded with English words and phrases, or even whole sentences. Some movies are also simultaneously made in two or three languages (either using subtitles or several soundtracks). [[Chennai film music|Chennai's film composers]] have popularised their highly unique, syncretic style of film music across the world. Quite often, Tamil movies feature [[Madras Tamil]], a colloquial version of Tamil spoken in [[Chennai]].

There are 3 major roles in the Tamil film value chain ''viz'' producer, distributor and exhibitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/dp/pyra.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Draft RHP PSTL 31.07.06.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721170237/http://www.sebi.gov.in/dp/pyra.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributor purchases theatrical distribution rights from the producer for exhibiting the film in a defined territory. The distributor performs enhanced functions such as:
# part-financing of film (in case of minimum guarantee / advance based purchase of film rights)
# localised marketing of film
# selection of exhibition halls
# managing the logistics of physical print distribution

There are three popular approaches to transfer of distribution rights via distribution contracts:

# ''Minimum Guarantee + Royalty'' – Here, the producer sells the distribution rights for a defined territory for a minimum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Any surplus is shared between the producer and distributor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:2) after deducting tax, show rentals, commission, print costs and publicity costs. Effectively, the distributor becomes a ''financier'' in the eyes of the market. This is the most common channel available to high budget producers.
# ''Commission'' – Here, the distributor pays the producer the entire box office collection after deducting commission. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the producer. This is the most common channel available to low budget producers. By the first decade of 21st century, about 90 per cent of the films were released on commission basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/how-film-distribution-has-changed-with-times-in-kollywood/article8289535.ece Commission basis is the dominant business model by 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Outright Sale'' – Here, the producer sells all distribution and theatrical exhibition rights for a defined territory exclusively to a distributor. Effectively, the distributor becomes a ''producer'' in the eyes of the market. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the distributor.

There are four popular approaches to transfer of exhibition rights via exhibition contracts:
# ''Theatre Hire'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor the entire box office collection after deducting tax and show rentals. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the distributor. This is the most common channel for low-budget films, casting rank newcomers, with unproven track record. In Chennai, a moderate theater with AC and DTS can fetch around {{INR}}1 lakh as weekly rent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-column/screening-a-movie---an-eye-opener.html Weekly rent is at least 1 lakh in Chennai cinemas]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Fixed Hire'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a maximum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Rental is not chargeable per show. Any surplus after deducting tax is retained by the exhibitor. Effectively, the exhibitor becomes a ''distributor'' in the eyes of the market. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the exhibitor.
# ''Minimum Guarantee + Royalty'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a minimum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Rental is not chargeable per show. Any surplus after deducting tax and show rental is shared in a pre-set ratio (1:2) between the distributor and exhibitor typically.
# ''Revenue Share'' – Here, the distributor shares with the exhibitor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:1), the entire box office collection of the film after deducting tax. Rental is not chargeable per show. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film is shared between the exhibitor and distributor. This is the most common channel preferred by multiplex screens.

==Legislation==
Film studios in Chennai are bound by legislation, such as the Cinematography Film Rules of 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peso.gov.in/cinematographic.aspx|title=Cinematograph film rules, 1948|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cinematography Act of 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbfcindia.gov.in/html/uniquepage.aspx?unique_page_id=4|title=Posters|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Central Board of Film certification (CBFC)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134645/http://cbfcindia.gov.in/html/uniquepage.aspx?unique_page_id=4|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Copyright Act of 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/CopyrightRules1957.pdf|title=INDIAN COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil Nadu]], cinema ticket prices are regulated by the government.

The '''Tango Desktop Project''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] initiative to create a set of design guidelines and to provide a consistent [[user experience]] for applications on [[desktop environment]]s. The project has created a set of [[computer icon|icon]]s known as the Tango Icon Library, which is described as a "proof of concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |accessdate=2011-06-15 |title=Tango Icon Library – Tango Desktop Project |date=2010-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120233412/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |archive-date=2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tango Desktop Project is a project of [[freedesktop.org]], and is closely linked with other freedesktop.org guidelines such as the Standard Icon Theming Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec |title=icon-theme-spec |publisher=Freedesktop.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The objective of the project is to allow software developers to easily integrate their software, in terms of appearance, with the desktop computer. The visual inconsistencies that arise from different [[Freedesktop.org|desktop]] environments ([[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]]...) and custom distributions make it hard for third parties to target [[Linux]]. Ideally, any project that follows the Tango guidelines will have a [[look and feel]] that matches well with other icons and applications that follow the guidelines.

The style does not aim to be visually unique to distinguish itself. Instead, a secondary aim of the project is to create a standard style that makes applications look appropriate running on operating systems common at that time, such that [[Independent software vendor|ISV]]s will find that their application does not look out of place on [[Windows XP]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], or [[Xfce]].

Apart from the visual guidelines, the project aims to provide a set of common metaphors for the icons. Tango follows the Freedesktop.org's [[Standard Icon Theming Specification]] and actively develops the [[Freedesktop.org]]'s [[Standard Icon Naming Specification]], defining names for the most common icons and the used metaphors.

Many free software projects, such as [[GIMP]], [[Scribus]], and [[GNOME]], have started to follow the Tango style guidelines for their icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Tango Showroom |date=2008-09-12 |website=Tango Desktop Project |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906111805/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[ReactOS]] and [[Mozilla Firefox 3]] uses Tango icons when it is unable to find the user's installed iconset, and also for icons not covered by said iconset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = https://blog.mozilla.org/faaborg/2007/11/13/update-on-the-firefox-3-linux-theme/ | date=2007-11-13 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | first = Alex | last = Faaborg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible for proprietary closed source applications to use Tango Desktop Project icons. Examples highlighted by the Tango Showroom include VMware Workstation 6 and Medsphere OpenVista CIS.

== History ==

The Tango icons were originally released under a [[copyleft]] [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|license]] (Attribution-ShareAlike), but were released into the [[public domain]] in 2009 in order to make it easier to reuse them.

== Palette ==

This is the [[hexadecimal]] color [[Palette (computing)|palette]] used by the Tango Desktop Project, organized by color group and brightness:&lt;ref name=TangoGuidelines/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22170">[[Image:Stpaulandpetertemplon.png|thumb|upright|A reconstruction of the templon of St. Paul's and Peter's Cathedral.]]
A '''templon''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τέμπλον meaning "temple", plural ''templa'') is a feature of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] churches consisting of a barrier separating the [[nave]] from the [[sacraments]] at the [[altar]].

The solid templon first appeared in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably not much different from the [[altar rails]] of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern [[iconostasis]], still found in Orthodox churches today.

It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an [[architrave]] (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the [[sanctuary]]. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, [[icons]] were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.

==Origins==
[[Image:Proskenionastemplon.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[scaenae frons]] (theater screen) portraying a three-doored temple facade, posited in the early 20th century as a possible origin for the design of the templon.]]The templon most likely has an independent origin from that of [[Latin]] chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, [[theater]] heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to [[Sophocles]], consciously imitated the classical ''proskenion'' (Latin [[proscenium]]; the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down.&lt;ref name="myref-12"&gt;[[Josef Strzygowski|Strzygowski, Josef]]. "A Sarcophagus of the Sidamara Type ... and the Influence of Stage Architecture upon the Art of Antioch." ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', '''Vol. 27''' (1907). 99–122.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian [[liturgy]] was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A much more plausible theory is that the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the [[Torah screen]] in [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical [[Syria]]n [[Paganism|pagan]] [[temple]].&lt;ref name="myref-2"&gt;Swift, Emerson Howland. ''Hagia Sophia''. Columbia University Press, New York, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct comparison can also be made to the layout of the great [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. The most sacred and innermost portion, known as the [[Holy of Holies]], was where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept. This room was separated from the larger part of the main building's interior by a large curtain, the "[[parochet|veil of the temple]]". Only the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on [[Yom Kippur]]. The third part was the entrance court. This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostatsis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies containing the consecrated Eucharist - the manifestation of the New Covenant, from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In Orthodox Christian tradition, with the exception of churches at women's [[monastery|monasteries]], only men with good cause may enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis.

Barriers called templons in Greek were also used on occasions when the [[Roman Emperor]]s appeared in public, to segregate the Imperial retinue from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.108-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Templon'' is a [[loan word]] in Greek, from the [[Latin]] ''templum'', "[[temple]]"; how and why it came to have its present meaning is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the form of the templon resembles a pagan [[temple]]. The steps up to the [[apse]] (semicircle where the altar is located) are analogous to the [[stylobate|stereobate]] and [[stylobate]] of the temple (the floor of a temple). The colonnettes arranged in the π shape resemble the [[columns]] that surround all four sides of a temple, the [[architrave]] looks like the architrave on a temple, and the carved disks on the architrave are analogous to the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] on the [[entablature]]. 

However, it has also been suggested that the name templon derives not from the pagan temples but from the Christian idea of the shrine where God was worshipped, or more specifically the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].
In almost all modern European languages, the word ''templon'' is a direct and late borrowing of the Greek architectural term, and it is rarely found outside the academic usage; besides the Greek ''templon'', another direct descendant of the Latin ''templum'', having the same architectural meaning, is the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''tâmplă'', "iconostasis".{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=56280 tâmplă]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} at the Online Version of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early templa==
[[File:Rom, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Innenansicht.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome]]
Archaeological evidence for an early templon comes from the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Cathedral of St. John at Stoudios]] in Constantinople, a [[basilica]] dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], built around 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low [[parapet]] (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.&lt;ref name="myref-9"&gt;Matthews, Thomas F. ''The Early Churches of Constantinople: Architecture and Liturgy''. Pennsylvania State University Press, PA, 1971, {{ISBN|0-271-00108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments of a marble templon have been discovered on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Was the Aksa Mosque built over the remains of a Byzantine church?, By ETGAR LEFKOVITS, Jerusalem Post, November 16, 2008 [https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Was-the-Aksa-Mosque-built-over-the-remains-of-a-Byzantine-church]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some architectural and archaeological evidence of early templa, the first and most detailed description of a templon comes from a poem by [[Paul the Silentiary]], describing [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. It was composed near the end of [[Justinian I]]’s reign and was probably recited on [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], January 6, 563, celebrating the reinauguration of the church after the reconstruction of the great dome.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Hagia Sophia’s templon surrounded, according to Paulus, "such space as was reserved in the eastern arch of the great church for the bloodless sacrifices".&lt;ref name="myref-8"&gt;Lethaby, W. R. and Swainson, Harold. ''The Church of Sancta Sophia Constantinople: A Study of Byzantine Building''. Macmillan and Co., London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it stretched the length of the eastern semidome, including the apse but excluding the [[exedra]]e (half-dome recesses in a wall). Twelve silver-covered marble columns of approximately 4.94 meters from base to capital were arranged on three sides of a rectangular ground plan around the altar. A horizontal entablature rested upon these. Three doors allowed entry to the apse, the central one larger than the other two. Though earlier scholars have proposed that all columns and all doors were in a single line parallel to the apse, modern reconstructions show the central portal facing out to the nave with the smaller doors each located on the other sides of the rectangular plan.&lt;ref name="myref-15"&gt;Xydis, Stephen G. "The Chancel Barrier, Solea, and Ambo of Hagia Sophia." ''The Art Bulletin''. '''Vol. 29''', No. 1 (March 1947). 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In between the columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On them had been carved the monograms of Justinian and [[Theodora (6th century)]], even though Theodora had been dead for several years, as well as a many-armed [[cross]] in the center. On the center of the architrave was a [[repoussé]] medallion of [[Christ]]. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the [[Prophet]]s, the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], and finally the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to [[St. John of Ephesus]], rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix.&lt;ref name="myref-10"&gt;Procopius. ''Procopius. Vol. VII: Buildings''. Trans. H.B. Dewing and Glanville Downey, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an inscription to [[St. John the Theologian]] over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. [[St. John the Baptist]] was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.

In any case, the majority of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia’s, were covered in precious metals and others used [[polychrome]] [[marble]]s. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the architraves with [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the [[architrave]], initially with carved busts. This continued from the time of Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in [[Elaiussa Sebaste|Sebaste]] in [[Phrygia]], which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to [[iconoclasm]]. [[Saint Nicephorus|Nicephorus I]], [[Patriarch]] of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his ''Antirretikoi''. Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of [[Saint Panteleimon]] in [[Nerzei]].&lt;ref name="myref-6"&gt;Kavan, Katrina. "Screen: Early Christian and Byzantine." ''The Grove Dictionary of Art Online''. Oxford University Press, Accessed 23 March 2004. &lt;www.groveart.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[Image:Iconostasis in Moscow.jpg|thumb|Five-panel Deesis row, Iconostasis of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]], 1405 – the first five-row Iconostasis]]
The templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries except in [[Cappadocia]]. As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches, though by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref name="myref-7"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kostof| first= Spiro| title=Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia| publisher= MIT Press| location= Cambridge, MA| year= 1972| isbn= 0-262-11042-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The templon began to change forms to the medieval templon with the attachment of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of these images are from the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the [[Deesis]] (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], linking the scene of Lazarus with the [[Holy Week]] images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style is representative of the increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.&lt;ref name="myref-3"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Epstein| first= A. W.| title=The Middle-Byzantine Sanctuary Barrier: Templon or Iconostasis?| journal=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association| volume= 134| year=1981| pages= 1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the Middle Byzantine period, the space between the colonnettes was not filled with icons but with curtains. [[Nicholaos Andidorum]] describes in his ''Protheoria'' "the shutting of the doors and the closing of the curtain over them".&lt;ref name="myref-13"&gt;"Templon." ''The [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]''. Ed. Alexander P. Kazhdan, '''Vol. 3'''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1991. 2023–4, {{ISBN|0-19-504652-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widespread image on the medieval templon seems to have been the Deesis. Its popularity arose from not only its simplicity and elegance, suggesting the [[efficacy of prayer]] and the threat of the [[Last Judgment]], but also because it could be easily adapted to the patron’s tastes with the addition of secondary scenes and characters, as in the Saint Catherine's Monastery where scenes from the life of [[St Eustratios]] appear on either side of the Deesis on a templon beam. [[Proskynetarion|Proskynetaria]] (large icons) also played a major part in the decoration of the medieval templon, either as monumental images placed on the piers flanking the templon or as portable images in front of the screen. Proskynetaria of both these types still exist in Cyprus, from Lagoudera, now in the Archbishop’s Palace in Nicosia, and in St Neophytos.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Naya, Carlo (1816-1882) - n. 52 - Venezia - Interno di San Marco.jpg|thumb|A columnar templon at [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]]]]

Sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries, icons and proskynetaria began to be placed in the intercolumnar openings on the templon. After the reconquest in 1261, carving on the medieval templon approached [[sculpture|sculpture in the round]]. From this period, the first wood-carved templa, or [[iconostasis|iconostases]], were produced. They for most part had a fixed program of icon decoration with three levels: the Local, the Deesis, and the Festival tiers. Early Russian versions were at chest height, and called "thoraxis" in Greek.

The full height iconostasis became standard in the 15th century, and probably owes more to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russians]] than anything else. The first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed for the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]] in 1405, and soon copied by his assistant [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.109-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fifth Plague of Egypt''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Romanticism|Romantic]] English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] currently in the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. Despite its title, it depicts [[Moses]] cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, known as the seventh plague.

==Description==
In the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white [[pyramid]] in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom.

Although the painting would be categorised as a [[history painting]] for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a [[landscape painting]], clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape. The painting shows the force of nature as a more important factor than the force of man, which is minuscule.

==Historical information==
Turner describes the seventh [[Plagues of Egypt|plague of Egypt]] that God cursed upon the Egyptians for punishment of not releasing the Israelites from slavery, as described in the [[Old Testament]] [[Book of Exodus]], 9:13–35. Turner possibly mislabelled this painting as the wrong plague when he submitted it, but the title has not changed.

Turner submitted this large-scale painting to the annual [[Royal Academy]] exhibition in London in 1800. The twenty-four-year-old Turner was eager to impress the London art critics, with the largest canvas submitted by a young artist. He attempted to show his virtuosity as a history painter, even when his landscape painting background is entirely evident.&lt;ref name="Plague"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fifth Plague of Egypt|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/fifth-plague-egypt-joseph-mallord-william-turner|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only been accepted into the Royal Academy as an Associate Member in 1799, and was eager to show his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner, J.

===Acquisition===
The painting was purchased from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased the painting in 1807, before selling it to Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired the painting by 1853, and it was at sale at Christies in London in 1866. The painting was purchased by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, the painting was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where the painting stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family. John Mitchell bought the painting in 1955; the IMA purchased the painting in the same year from Mitchell with funds from the Lilly family.&lt;ref name="Plague" /&gt;

The '''''Marriage of the Virgin''''' is a painting by the Italian late medieval painter [[Michelino da Besozzo]], dating from c. 1435 and housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of [[New York City|New York]], USA.

It is the artist's only certain one alongside ''[[Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (Michelino da Besozzo)|Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine]]'' in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena)|Pinacoteca Nazionale]] at [[Siena]].

==Description==
The painting depicts the [[Virgin Mary]] while receiving the marriage ring by [[Saint Joseph]], in front of a priest of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. Michelino painted a Dove of the [[Holy Ghost]] above Joseph, to underline the supernatural choice of him as Mary's husband. At the right is a group of women, while on the left are the other pretenders, painted in angered postures: one, in the foreground, is cracking a stick. The latter is a theme found in numerous following representation of the scene, including [[Marriage of the Virgin (Raphael)|Raphael's]].

The scene is set in a portico, with limited use of gold in the background, showing that is a late work by Michelino.

'''''The Reluctant Fundamentalist''''' is a novel by [[Pakistani]] author [[Mohsin Hamid]], published in 2007.

The novel uses the technique of a [[frame story]], which takes place during the course of a single evening in an outdoor [[Lahore]] cafe, where a bearded Pakistani man called Changez tells a nervous American stranger about his love affair with an American woman, and his eventual abandonment of America. A short story adapted from the novel, called "Focus on the Fundamentals," appeared in the fall 2006 issue of ''[[The Paris Review]]''. A [[The Reluctant Fundamentalist (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel by director [[Mira Nair]] premiered at the 2012 [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19421160 |title= 'The Reluctant Fundamentalist Opens Venice Film Festival' |date= 30 August 2012 |work= Screen|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot/Summary ==
The story begins on the streets of Lahore. A Pakistani man, Changez, offers to direct an American visitor where he can find a good cup of tea. As they wait for their tea, Changez begins to weave a long story about his life, especially his time living in the United States - in between making remarks about the [[History of Lahore|history]], [[List of places in Lahore|landmarks]] and society of Lahore, his native city which he loves and of which he is proud. The unnamed American is restless but remains to listen.

Changez tells the American he was an excellent student who, after completing his bachelor's degree in Finance, joined Underwood Samson, a consultancy firm, as an analyst. After graduating from [[Princeton University]], he vacationed in Greece with fellow Princetonians, where he met Erica, an aspiring writer. He was instantly smitten by her, but his feelings remained almost unrequited because she was still grieving over the death of her childhood sweetheart Chris, who succumbed to lung cancer. After a date, they return to his place and he proceeds to have sex with her, but stops because her emotional attachment to Chris prevents her from becoming aroused. After this incident there is an interlude where neither contact each other. But soon they go on another date, after which they have sex when Changez convinces Erica to close her eyes and fantasize that she is with Chris. Though Changez is satisfied at this development in their relationship, this irreversibly damages their relationship. Soon she begins treatment in a mental institution. He notices she is physically emaciated and no longer her former self. After this meeting he travels to Chile on an assignment. When he returns to meet her, it is found that she has left the institution and her clothes were found near the Hudson River. Officially she is stated as a missing person, as her body has not been found.

In his professional life, he impresses his peers and gets earmarked by his superiors for his work, especially Jim, the person who recruited him, develops a good rapport with him, and holds him in high esteem. This prompts the firm to send him to offshore assignments in the Philippines and [[Valparaíso]], Chile. In Chile, he is very distracted due to developments in the world and, responding to the parabolic suggestion of the publisher his company is there to assess (which would lead to its break up), he visits the nearby preserved home of the late left-wing poet [[Pablo Neruda]] and comes to see himself as a servant of the American empire that has constantly interfered with and manipulated his [[Pakistan|homeland]]. He returns from Chile to New York without completing the assignment and ends up losing his job.

Politically, Changez is surprised by his own reaction to the [[September 11th attacks]]. "Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased", he tells the American. He observes the air of suspicion towards Pakistanis. Changez, due to his privileged position in society, is not among those detained or otherwise abused, but he notices a change in his treatment in public. To express solidarity with his countrymen after his trip to Chile, he starts to grow a beard. After the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]], India and Pakistan mobilize leading to a [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|standoff]]. Noticing the US response to this situation, he has an epiphany that his country is being used as a pawn. With no job, an expiring visa and no reason to stay in the United States, he moves back to Lahore.

After returning to Lahore, he becomes a professor of finance at the local university. His experience and insight in world issues gains his admiration among students. As a result, he becomes a mentor to large groups of students on various issues. He and his students actively participate in demonstrations against policies that were detrimental to the sovereignty of Pakistan. Changez advocates nonviolence, but a relatively unknown student gets apprehended for an assassination attempt on an American representative, which brings the spotlight on Changez. In a widely televised interview, he strongly criticizes the militarism of [[U.S. foreign policy]]. This act makes people surrounding him think that someone might be sent to intimidate him or worse.

As they sit in the cafe, Changez keeps noting that the American stranger is very apprehensive of their surroundings, that he is in possession of a sophisticated [[satellite phone]] on which he is repeatedly messaging, and that under his clothing there is a bulge which might be a gun. Changez walks the stranger toward his hotel. As they walk, the American, now highly suspicious that he is in immediate danger, reaches into his pocket, possibly for a gun. Changez says he trusts it is simply his holder of business cards. But the novel ends without revealing what was in his pocket, leaving the reader to wonder if the stranger was a [[CIA]] agent, possibly there to kill Changez, or if Changez, in collusion with the waiter from the cafe, had planned all along to do harm to the American.

The '''Torcuato di Tella Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] foundation organized for the promotion of [[Argentine culture]].

==Overview==
The di Tella Foundation and its institute were created on July 22, 1958, the tenth anniversary of the death of industrialist and arts patron [[Torcuato di Tella]]. Funding for the project, organized by his sons, Torcuato and [[Guido di Tella]], was raised using the United States model of corporate financing, as well as by the donation of 10% of the [[Siam di Tella]] corporation's [[public stock]]. Its objective was initially limited to an arts program revolving primarily around the display of the di Tella family's private collections, which prominently included works by [[Henry Moore]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name=ditella&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/instituto-di-tella.html Instituto Di Tella: Promoción del arte. Experimentación audiovisual. Investigación y financiación artística {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of the foundation consisted of family members, though the institute was directed by a board that included academics and intellectuals from outside the family. Guido di Tella would serve as president, and the post of director of the institute was offered to Enrique Oteiza, whose family were leading [[Pampas]]-area landowners. The foundation also received funding in the form of grants from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]]s, after which the modest initiative expanded into [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|theater]] and [[Argentine music|music]], and grew to become the most significant cultural institution in Buenos Aires of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

The institute continued to influence prevailing trends in the history of Argentine culture, however, and it adopted and advanced a [[modernist]] trend in various artistic disciplines. Its audiovisual center, established in 1960, and directed by Roberto Villanueva, premiered with a play, ''El Desatino'' (''The Folly''). The production's scenery backdrops were projected through slides, and introduced audiences to [[Nacha Guevara]] and [[Les Luthiers]]. This format would be promoted in subsequent years for its ability to broadcast material through compact and portable media in a way that would stimulate a network of local groups active in the cultural field.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt; 
[[File:Instituto di Tella.bmp|thumb|left|210px|The Torcuato di Tella Institute at Florida Street during its heyday in the 1960s]]

Following its establishment, the di Tella art collection was transferred to the foundation, and [[Jorge Romero Brest]] hosted a free show at the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Museum of Fine Arts]], which the leading local art critic directed. The activities were transferred to a small office in the Museum of Fine Arts in August 1960, and this was followed by an annual award for national and international artists, many of which sold their works to the di Tella collection. As part of the awards program, the winners were awarded scholarships covering study abroad and an exhibition of works in a North American or European gallery. Growing local interest in [[Latin American art]] was accompanied by an initiative to show the di Tella collection across the Argentine hinterland, for which a minibus was purchased in 1963; the experiment, however, ended the following year, when the vehicle crashed in a rural [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] road.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;
[[File:La Menesunda.jpg|thumb|210px|Patrons venture into ''La Menesunda'', Marta Minujín's famed 1965 "[[happening]]" at the institute.]]
 
An initiative by Guido di Tella led to the institute's relocation into a modern, newly completed [[Florida Street]] building in August 1963. The offices were rented by SIAM di Tella at the northern end of Florida Street, near [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], a busy pedestrian intersection in the upscale [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] district that could attract larger audiences. The building was refurbished with the addition of three stage theatres, and interiors designed to be inviting, with a floor-to-ceiling glass panel façade featuring publicity photos taken by Humberto Rivas, and a large lobby. The modern, air-conditioned building was propitious for exhibits and artistic events year-round. Its café, like the gallery, was staffed by attendants who wore no uniforms, and allowed patrons to smoke and take photographs at their leisure.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Founded by [[classical music|classical]] composer [[Alberto Ginastera]], CLAEM (the Latin American Center for Advanced Musical Studies) was made part of the institute in 1962, yielding numerous productions of [[dodecaphonic]], [[electronic music|electronic]], and [[acoustic music]]; CLAEM attracted prominent international guest lecturers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. A visual arts center (CAV) was also inaugurated at the new address. Directed by Romero Brest, CAV became the leading Buenos Aires center for the display and promotion for [[avant-garde]] creations. CAV introduced art patrons to sculptors [[Juan Carlos Distéfano]], [[Julio Le Parc]], and [[Clorindo Testa]], as well as painters [[Romulo Macció]], [[Luis Felipe Noé]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Antonio Seguí]], and [[conceptual art]]ists such as [[Edgardo Giménez]] and [[Marta Minujín]]. The latter garnered interest after earning the institute's first National Award in 1964, and became known for her "[[happening]]s." Erotic in some aspects, and provocative to conservative local audiences, her early di Tella Institute events included ''Eróticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revuélquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). She then joined Rubén Santantonín in 1965 to create ''La Menesunda'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minujín's "mayhem." &lt;ref name=clarin2&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clarín'' (7/6/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Le Parc - by Juan Carlos Distéfano.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Cover designed by Juan Carlos Distéfano for the institute's 1967 exhibition of Julio Le Parc's refracted photography]]

Already established as the leading local center for [[pop art]], the di Tella Institute also became a forum for art as political commentary. This was dramatized by what became the center's most contentious display, sculptor [[León Ferrari]]'s  ''La civilización occidental y cristiana'' (''Western-Christian Civilization''), in October 1965. The work displays [[Christ]] [[crucifixion|crucified]] not by the traditional [[Christian cross|cross]]; but by a [[fighter aircraft|fighter plane]], as a symbolic protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentinaxplora.com/activida/arte/ditella/ditell.htm Argentina Xplora: El Instituto di Tella {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Experiencia Instituto Di Tella.jpg|thumb|210px|An "experience" at the di Tella, where experimental theatre became a 'happening' for hapless audiences.]]

A turn of historical events in 1966 proved detrimental to the institute, and to [[freedom of expression]], when the civilian administration of President [[Arturo Illia]] was deposed on June 28 by the [[Argentine Armed Forces]], and was replaced with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]. Moderate in comparison with many of his counterparts in other Latin American nations, Onganía was, however, a member of the right-wing [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] power group, [[Opus Dei]], and as such, found many of the developments in Argentine culture during the 1960s offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Robert. ''Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei''. St. Martin's Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing his distaste for modern culture was Luis Margaride, whom he named head of the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Federal District Police]], and who would be remembered for his crusades against nightclubs, long hair, and miniskirts.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Martin. ''Dossier Secreto''. Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a government policy backdrop such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, [[Noche de los Bastones Largos|particularly in academia]]) left Argentina, many never to return.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;Crawley, Eduardo. ''A House Divided: Argentina 1880-1980''. St. Martin's Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-styled ''mazanana loca'' (''city block of madness''), the center's agenda remained active initially, and this new era was marked by the advent of the "Experience"{{spaced ndash}}a fusion of the more controversial happenings with [[experimental theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/suple/radar/mayo/98-05-24/nota2_a.htm ''Página/12'' (5/24/1998) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in audiences and contributions, as well as the Siam di Tella Corporation's own, mounting financial problems, led to the curtailment of most of its activities by 1969, however. The Ford Foundation continued to support the institute, though these grants were contractually limited to social studies. The director, Enrique Oteiza, and two leading board members, [[Jorge Sábato]] and [[Roberto Cortés Conde]], resigned, and in May 1970, the famed Florida Street center hosted its last exhibition, a theatrical production by [[Marilú Marini]]. The foundation was bankrupt, and only the sale in 1971 of numerous works from its collection of [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque art]] to the federal government for 2.1 million [[Peso ley|pesos]] (US$500,000), staved off its liquidation.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Remembered nostalgically by friends of the arts, and particularly during the "[[Dirty War]]" of the late 1970s, when repression of political terrorism quickly extended to dissidents and controversial artists, the institute's absence became an example of the "cultural blackout" described by writer [[Ernesto Sábato]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jordán, Alberto. ''El Proceso''. Emecé Editores, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Following President [[Néstor Kirchner]]'s appointment of Torcuato Di Tella (jr.) as Secretary of Culture in 2003, the idea of reviving the storied center was first plausibly discussed by the president of the board of regents of [[Torcuato di Tella University]], [[Manuel Mora y Araujo]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/24/sociedad/s-05601.htm ''Clarín'' (2/24/2007) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the 1960s-era documentation and numerous works had been stored by the library at the university, the di Tella family's surviving contribution to local culture, and the material's recataloguing was initiated in 2004. New facilities were developed that year from a former water company building by one of the center's alumni, sculptor and architect [[Clorindo Testa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=630140 ''La Nación'' (8/25/2004) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 21, 2007, the institute's center for visual arts was reinaugurated at the [[Figueroa Alcorta Avenue]] location with the ''Otro Modo'' (''Another Way'') Festival.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;  Continuing to host [[media art|media]] and [[conceptual art]] displays, the institute celebrated its 50th anniversary in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/03/07/um/m-01623241.htm ''Clarín'' (3/7/2008) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UGATLahi Artist Collective''' is a visual artists' organization based in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mikas Matsuzawa |url=http://diwatangluna.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/effigies-as-propaganda-the-process-of-creating-effigies-an-interview-with-ugatlahis-iggy-rodriguez-by-mikas-matsuzawa/ |title=Effigies as Propaganda: The Process of Creating Effigies (An Interview with UgatLahi’s Iggy Rodriguez) by Mikas Matsuzawa « diwatangluna |publisher=Diwatangluna.wordpress.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulatlat.com/news/5-24/5-24-art.htm |title=The Philippines's alternative weekly magazine |publisher=Bulatlat |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was started in the early 1990s.  The group creates images of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtocreate.com/artists/main/ugatlahi-artist-collective |title=Artists |publisher=Freedom to Create |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, they have created [[Effigy|effigies]] of the [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] for each [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jerome Aning |url=http://inquirer.net/specialfeatures/sona2009/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20080726-150903 |title=State of the Nation Address |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is also active in performance and installation art.

Most UGATLahi artists are often nicknamed as 'artists of social conscience'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umali |first=Ronalyn M. |url=http://www.tomasinomagazine.com/buen-calubayan-and-iggy-rodriguez-artists-of-social-conscience |title=Artists of social conscience &amp;#124; Tomasino |publisher=Tomasinomagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==

In 1992, UGATLahi Artist Collective was formed in response to the growing concerns of Filipino students regarding the role of culture and the visual arts in nation-building. Initially, UGATLahi was a multi-disciplinary arts collective, which later evolved into an organization focusing on the visual arts.&lt;ref name="inkwentro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkwentro.wordpress.com/tungkol-sa-ugatlahi/ |title=Tungkol sa UGATLahi Artist Collective |publisher=Inkwentro |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles and Practices ==

UGATLahi believes that art and culture has a big role in giving voice to the [[Marginalization|marginalized]] social sectors. It supports cultural initiatives from these sectors, helping to develop their potential to recognize and realize their role in the country's future.&lt;ref name="arkibongbayan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkibongbayan.org/2007-07July23-SONA-1/pix4ugatlahi01to06/About%20ugatlahi.doc |title=About UGATLahi(MS Word document) |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It urges the campaign for a nationalist culture through engaging in projects and collaborations with other art groups by helping to organize and support the struggles of workers and urban poor communities throughout the country's [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]].&lt;ref name="inkwentro"/&gt;

Most of the group's significant works were made during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001#Background|Oust Erap]] campaign in the year 2000, where murals and papier-mâché effigies were created and displayed during rallies, peoples’ assemblies and in picket lines.&lt;ref name="arkibongbayan"/&gt;

UGATLahi seeks to promote awareness of human rights. In 2010, after the [[2010 Manila hostage crisis|hostage taking]] incident in Manila, the group called for swift justice for those responsible for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/274748/artists-seek-help-heal-wounds-hostage-tragedy |title=Artists seek to help heal wounds in hostage tragedy &amp;#124; The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online |publisher=Mb.com.ph |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the [[Maguindanao massacre]], the group constructed an effigy of the prime suspects in the killing riding a backhoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/206601/journalists-worldwide-to-mark-first-anniversary-of-ampatuan-massacre |title=Journalists worldwide to mark first anniversary of Ampatuan massacre - Nation - GMANews.TV - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News |publisher=GMANews.TV |date= |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

UGATLahi's influences include notable art collectives such as Bread and Puppet and Taring Padi [[Taring Padi]], an Indonesian art collective which also dwelves in political art.

== Student Involvement ==

Though universities are not directly involved with UGATLahi, a lot of students from prestigious universities in the [[Philippines]] such as the [[University of the Philippines]], [[University of Santo Tomas]], and [[Adamson University]] have closely collaborated with this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulay-diwa.com/raoul_rodriquez |title=Kulay-Diwa Gallery of Philippine Contemporary Art - Raoul Rodriquez |publisher=Kulay-diwa.com |date=1987-02-07 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bulatlat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulatlat.com/news/5-24/5-24-art.htm |title=The Philippines's alternative weekly magazine |publisher=Bulatlat |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effigies ==

*In 2011, Ugatlahi constructed Philippines' president Noynoy Aquino's second effigy, which resembled a gigantic rotten egg atop a military humvee.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/29055/militants-prepare-for-%E2%80%98penoy%E2%80%99-effigy-burning-on-monday&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010, Ugatlahi created the very first effigy  that was not burned. It was a 14 feet by 15 feet effigy of the newly elected president [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III]]. The group portrayed the Philippine president as a magician conjuring illusions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/196798/militants-prepare-noynoy-the-magician-effigy-for-sona "Militants prepare Noynoy the magician"] Gmanews.tv(2010-07-23).

*Early 1990s, Ugatlahi has started facilitating this effigy burning since president [[Joseph Estrada]]'s term. They have worked closely with the activist group, BAYAN.&lt;ref name="bulatlat1"/&gt;

== Collaborations ==

UGATLahi links up with other artists initiative such as TutoK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-40/6-40-public.htm |title=The Philippines's alternative weekly magazine |publisher=Bulatlat |date=2006-11-11 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; UGATLahi regularly performs at [http://www.neo-angono.com/ NeoAngono]'s annual Public Art Festival.

== Giving Back ==

UGATLahi is also involved in some humanitarian activities with fellow artist groups such as:

*Sagip Sining Art 2 D Rescue - a fundraising activity to help typhoon victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalcenter.gov.ph/page.php?page_id=313 |title=Cultural Center of the Philippines - JOIN SAGIP SINING &amp; HELP TYPHOON VICTIMS |publisher=Culturalcenter.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veejay''' is a [[Free software|free]] visual instrument and realtime video sampler for [[Linux]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2 or later.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://code.dyne.org/veejay/tree/veaejay-current/veejay-server/COPYING]'',License Information page&lt;/ref&gt;

Veejay functions as a video tracker and editing tool, as well as a realtime video sequencer and effects generator that allows for live interaction. Additionally, the generated content can be recorded to disk for future use.

== Development ==

The project was started in June 2002 by Niels Elburg, Matthijs van Henten and Dursun Koca with the objective to provide a tool that would allow the user to play the video like a piano (a visual instrument) and record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling).

Veejay is not a traditional video editing application; The application aims for a high level of [[interoperability]] with other Audio/video applications through the use of [[Shared resource]]s, [[Loop device]]s, various messaging protocols such as [[MIDI|Midi]], [[Open Sound Control|OSC]] and veejay's internal message system VIMS, but also through supporting third party modules such as [[Frei0r|Frei0r plugins]] and frameworks like [[Pure Data]]. It offers a wide range of video effects, a Video Keyboard for the video artist and it offers scripting capabilities for use in (automated) video installations.

Veejay has separated the video processing core from the user interface, allowing the user(s) to control (multiple instances of) the application over the network.

== Features ==

* Support for MJPEG and other [[Intra-frame|Intra-frame Editing Codecs]]  
* [[Client–server model|Client/server]] architecture
* Live editing
* Live recording 
* Frame accurate
* Loop-based editing ([[Video sampling]]).
* [[Trick mode|Trick play]]
* [[Non-destructive editing]]
* Native [[YUV]] processing
* Support for video capture devices
* [[Slow motion]]
* More than 140 built-in realtime effects
* Effect chaining
* Support for [[Frei0r]]
* Support for [[interpolation]] of effect parameters
* Realtime mixing of video (Overlay, Chroma Keying, Blending, Transitions)
* Dynamic [[Frame rate]]
* Support for audio through [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]]
* Support for Multitrack
* Remote control via [[Open Sound Control]], [[MIDI]] and Veejay's own protocol VIMS
* Support for Vloopback
* Almost all functions can be controlled with the keyboard or [[MIDI]] controller
* Configurable video window placement
* Support for realtime [[audio time-scale/pitch modification]]
* Macro recording and playback
* MIDI learning
* Crash recovery

[[Image:WaterYam.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Water Yam'', First Edition, 1963]]
'''''Water Yam''''' is an [[artist's book]]&lt;ref&gt;'As a book, Water Yam has a very open structure....' The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary 2004, p311&lt;/ref&gt; by the American artist [[George Brecht]]. Originally published in Germany, June 1963&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams 1989, p216&lt;/ref&gt; in a box designed by [[George Maciunas]] and typeset by [[Tomas Schmit]], it has been re-published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online"&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html Dada and Radical Art Online]&lt;/ref&gt; the internationalist [[avant-garde]] art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a ''Fluxbox'' or ''Fluxkit'', contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as ''[[Event score|event-score]]s'', or ''fluxscores''. Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and perception. Or, in the words of the artist, “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.” The event-score was as much a critique of conventional artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against individual alienation.&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work is considered an important precursor to [[conceptual art]].

==The scores==
[[Image:ThreeLampEvents.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Three Lamp Event'', part of ''Lantern Extract'', a mail art project within the ''Yam Festival'', 1962,]]
Early editions of ''Water Yam'' collected around 70 event-scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book ''Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie'', and [[white-on-black]] invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'.

Many of the scores had been used in [[mail art]] events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or [[hectograph]]ed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on [[Bullet (typography)|bullet points]] (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes.

The scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as ''Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass'' • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as ''Chair Event'' • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as ''Thursday'' • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous ''Drip Music''; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as ''Keyhole'' •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card.

==Origins of event-scores==
{{See also|Fluxus#Event score}}

===John Cage and the experimental composition classes===
Brecht met the artist [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in 1957, and through Watts, [[Allan Kaprow]]. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of [[Howard Johnson's]], New Jersey. After a meeting with [[John Cage]] organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms,&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow, quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt; the three men started to attend Cage's experimental music composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation.... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg." Allan Kaprow&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow in conversation with Sidney Simon, early 70's. Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest [[Happening]]s, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd "never felt so controlled before."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764245/pg_2 Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois]&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Brecht  to pare the scores down to [[haiku]]-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed.

As well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] theories on art, which he'd written about at length in ''Chance-Imagery'', a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the [[Something Else Press]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the "event" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have said, to "make it strange" and "de-automatize our perception."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 ''Toward Events: An Arrangement'' clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience....works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p34&lt;/ref&gt; The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an epiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the Spring of 1960 ... waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a truly 'event' piece could be drawn from the situation." George Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht, The Origin of Events, 1970 Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p236&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival, 1963===
''Yam'' was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.'&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68"&gt;George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p68&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest ''Yam'' events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and [[George Segal|George Segal's]] farm. 
The ''Yam Festival'' was held on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey on 19 May 1963 to actions and happenings by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Wolf Vostell]].
The festival was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom. [[Wolf Vostell]] made here his happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/ ''Yam Festival'', 1963, Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In all of its formats and strategies Brecht's and Watt's ''Yam Festival'' operated as an alternative to the gallery system, producing "art" that could not be bought." Julia Robinson&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Artists participating in the festival included [[Alison Knowles]], Allan Kaprow, [[John Cage]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ay-O]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Ray Johnson]]. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. ''Yam'' evolved parallel to George Maciunas' ''Fluxfests'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Oxford Art Online, Fluxus essay by Michael Corris, Subscription Only]&lt;/ref&gt; set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music (''Festum Fluxorum''), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, [[Raoul Hausmann]] and [[Nam June Paik]]. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous ''Drip Event'', were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Emmett Williams]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

===Maciunas in Germany===
[[Image:DripPiece-Maciunas.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Brecht's ''Drip Music'', performed by George Maciunas, Amsterdam, 1963]]
Clearly aware of the ''Yam Festival'', Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|US army]] stationed at [[Eppstein#Ehlhalten|Ehlhalten]] near [[Wiesbaden]],&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Schmitt, Maciunas' assistant in 1963 quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p276&lt;/ref&gt; and placed them in a box with a fine example of his [[graphic design]] pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works'&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day.The use of multiple [[font]]s derived from his interest in experimental [[typography]] by [[Dada]] figures such as [[Hugo Ball]] and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. 

Published in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first ''Fluxkit'', and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's ''Yam Festival'', and Maciunas' ''FluxFests''.

==Later versions==
It has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English ''Parrot Impressions'', 1972, or the ''Lebeer Hossmann'' edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word ''Fluxus'' anywhere in or on the work. Ironically, for an object conceived as an "inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited edition (designed) to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist’s ego."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;hbutton_search.x=0&amp;hbutton_search.y=0&amp;hbutton_search=search&amp;source=oao_gao&amp;source=oao_t118&amp;source=oao_t234&amp;source=oao_t4&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Fluxus]".

'''''Ways of Hearing'''''({{ISBN|0 575 06809 4}}) is a 2001 book about [[pop music]] by [[Ben Thompson (author)|Ben Thompson]]. The book, which is subtitled "A user's guide to the pop psyche, from [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] to [[Eminem]]", describes how Western pop music intersects with films, videos, television shows, and fiction. The book includes short essays on a number of performers, including alternative rocker [[Blixa Bargeld]], contemporary composer [[John Cale]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], hip-hop artists [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Eminem]], Montreal avant-garde band [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], heavy metal singer-bassist [[Lemmy]], [[Meatloaf (singer)]], Rolling Stones guitarist [[Cliff Richard]], [[Pet Shop Boys]] and country rockers [[Wilco]]. The last section in the book describes different subgenres of pop, including metal, psychedelic, and political rock.

A review of the book calls it "a collection of rock writing" based around the author's goal of examining "the different ways of listening which form subcultural territories around various forms of popular music".&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Book review available online at: http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-ways-hearing-ben-thompson  Accessed on July 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer states that as "...a collection of rock journalism, this holds up quite well", and states that it contains "...competent, occasionally inspired rock writing". The reviewer states that Thompson has "...an intriguing way to introduce and link an apparently disparate bunch of information, and makes the reader contextualise seemingly off-hand utterings of musicians in within a new frame."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; The reviewer states that some of the interviews with performers that Thompson included seem like "padding". Moreover, the reviewer states that the "segments of academic-ese" that Thompson puts around the interview sections "tend to obfuscate the topic at hand, or, when they’re successful, set up an intriguingly open-ended argument which, ten pages later, is revealed to be literally open-ended...[without providing]... many of his own answers".&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

The '''Yale school''' is a colloquial name for an influential group of [[literary criticism|literary critics]], [[literary theory|theorists]], and [[continental philosophy|philosophers]] of [[literature]] that were influenced by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s philosophy of [[deconstruction]]. Many of the theorists were affiliated with [[Yale University]] in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists &amp;mdash; including [[Derrida]] himself &amp;mdash; subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the [[University of California at Irvine]].

==Relationship to deconstruction==
As a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the [[post-structuralist]] dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version of deconstruction that [[John D. Caputo]] has described as a "[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] free play of signifiers" and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Raschke, Carl "Loosening Philosophy’s Tongue: A Conversation with Jack Caputo" http://www.jcrt.org/archives/03.2/caputo_raschke.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) Zizek, Slavoj "A Plea for a Return to Differance (with a minor 'Pro Domo Sua')" ''Critical Inquiry'' 32 (2): 226-249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
During the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, [[Yale University]] was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to [[deconstruction]]. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as [[Paul de Man]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], and [[Harold Bloom]].  This group came to be known as the ''Yale School'' and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, ''Deconstruction and Criticism''. However, Harold Bloom's position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.

==Book summaries==

===Deconstruction and Criticism (1979)===
In his introduction to ''Deconstruction and Criticism'', Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other.  The former category he refers to as "boa-deconstructors"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, et al.  ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York: Continuum, 1979), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings.  

Hartman claims that both himself and Bloom are "barely deconstructionists" and that they "even write against it on occasion."&lt;ref&gt;''Deconstruction and Criticism'', ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of [[pathos]] as a fundamental impetus for literary language.  In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.

==Move to Irvine==
After teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, [[J. Hillis Miller]] left for the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he is today Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature.

Shortly after J. Hillis Miller's arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI’s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida’s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI’s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida’s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine’s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the [[Paul de Man]] Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man's work in comparative literature.
