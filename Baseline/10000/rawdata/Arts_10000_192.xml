      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1796">[[File:Kadirli Ala Mosque.jpg|thumb|Ala Mosque, Kadirli, Turkey]]
'''Ala Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Alacamii}}) is a historical  mosque in [[Kadirli]], [[Turkey]]. 

Ala Mosque is in Kadirli [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Osmaniye Province]] at {{coord|32|22|23|N|36|06|10|E}}. There is a Roman necropolis to the east of the mosque.&lt;ref name=AE&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/35509691/KADIRLI_ALACAMII_ARKEOLOJI_HAFRIYATI_Kaz%C4%B1_Eylem_Plan%C4%B1 Report by Engin Yüksel and Ayşegül Yüksel {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church and monastery built in the 5th century. After the city was captured by Kasım Bey of [[Beylik of Dulkadir|Dulkadirids]] in 1489, it was converted into a mosque and a [[madrasa]]. It was initially named ''Alaüddevle Mescit'' after Kasım Bey's father [[Bozkurt of Dulkadir|Alaüddevle Bozkurt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://osmaniye.gov.tr/kadirli-ala-cami Osmaniye governor's page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the name was shortened to "Ala". During the 19th century, Ala Mosque was used as an [[Ottoman Army]] depot, and after 1865 it was restored as a mosque. In 1924, during the Turkish Republic era, it was abandoned.&lt;ref name=RB&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3165833/The_Alacami_in_Kadirli_transformations_of_a_sacred_monument Report by Richard Bayliss]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning by 2012, the building underwent a restoration.&lt;ref name=AE/&gt;

According to Richard Batliss, the dimensions of the original building was {{cvt|33|x|19.5|m}}. A [[mimbar]] and a [[minaret]] were added during the Moslem era.&lt;ref name=RB/&gt;

'''''Bamboozled''''' is a 2000 [[Satire|satirical]] [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by [[Spike Lee]] about a modern televised [[minstrel show]] featuring black actors donning [[blackface]] makeup and the resulting violent fallout from the show's success. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Damon Wayans]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Savion Glover]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[Michael Rapaport]] and [[Mos Def]].

The film was given a [[limited release]] by [[New Line Cinema]] during the fall of 2000, and was released on [[DVD]] the following year. Critical reception was mixed, and the film was a [[box office bomb]].

==Plot==
Pierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use [[AAVE]] and the word "[[nigger]]" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use "nigger" since he is [[interracial marriage|married to a colored woman]] and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as "[[The Cosby Show|Cosby clones]]".

In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a [[minstrel show]] with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. ''Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show'' features black actors in [[blackface]], extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.

To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as [[satire]]. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant [[rap music|rap]] group called the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Maus]], led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show's content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.

Womack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing [[megalomania|ego]]. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix's attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.

The Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live [[webcast]]. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray's death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.

Furious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from [[Hollywood]] films of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the films used in the sequence are ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', ''[[Judge Priest]], ''[[Ub Iwerks]]' cartoon ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'', [[Walter Lantz]]'s cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', the ''[[Screen Songs]]'' short ''Jingle Jangle Jungle'', the [[Merrie Melodies]] short ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', and, from the [[Hal Roach]] comedy ''School's Out'', ''[[Our Gang]]'' kids [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]] and [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]].&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last ''Mantan'' sequence on stage.

==Production==
Most of the film was shot on [[Mini DV]] [[digital video]] using the [[Sony]] VX 1000 camera, and later converted to film format.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary" /&gt; This kept the budget limited to $10 million and allowed the use of multiple cameras to simultaneously capture masters, two-shots and close-ups to save time.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary" /&gt; The ''Mantan: New Millenium Minstrel Show'' sequences, and their sponsor ads, were shot on [[16 mm film|Super 16]] film stock.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary"&gt;[[Spike Lee|Lee, Spike]] (2001). Audio commentary for ''Bamboozled''. New Line Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Bamboozled (soundtrack)}}
The [[soundtrack album]] for the film was released September 26, 2000 by [[Motown Records]]. The album consisted of [[hip hop]] and contemporary [[R&amp;B]], and was [[India.Arie]]'s first time on an album, with six singles.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film was "perplexing," raising important issues but handling them poorly. "The film is a satirical attack on the way TV uses and misuses African-American images, but many viewers will leave the theater thinking Lee has misused them himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bamboozled-2000|title=Bamboozled Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2000) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín. Week three: biographical fiction| first = John| last = Mullan| newspaper =The Guardian| date = 30 April 2005| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/30/fiction.colmtoibin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canyon''''' is a 1959 painting by American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/abstract-exp-nyschool/ny-school/a/robert-rauschenberg-canyon|title=Robert Rauschenberg, Canyon|last=Folland|first=Tom|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/works/165011|title=Canyon|date=21 December 2013|publisher=MOMA|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is one of his most celebrated and best known works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2005/robert-rauschenberg|title=Exhibition Overview|date=20 December 2005|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of his [[combine painting|combine paintings]], which incorporated elements of sculpture into canvas-based pieces. ''Canyon'' features a taxidermied eagle, a pillow, and other elements. 

''Canyon'' was subject to an ownership controversy after the death of its owner, [[Ileana Sonnabend]], which ultimately resulted in its donation to [[MoMA]].

==Materials==
Between 1954 and 1965, Rauschenberg created "combine paintings" which involved affixing sculptural elements to more typical canvases. Elements such as photographic images, clothing and newspaper clippings could be attached either by paint, with string, or by other means. Other examples of such paintings are ''[[Reservoir (Rauschenberg)|Reservoir]]'' and ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]''.

''Canyon'' features a taxidermied [[bald eagle]], a pillow attached with string, a paint tube, and various textiles. The eagle was given to Rauschenberg by [[Sari Dienes]], and formerly belonged to a [[Rough Rider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/01/24/diving-into-rauschenbergs-canyon|title=Diving into Rauschenberg’s Canyon|last=Kim|first=Hannah|date=24 January 2014|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324705104578151561581708972|title=The Illegal Eagle and a Baldly Grasping IRS|last=Gibson|first=Eric|date=2 December 2012|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership history==
The painting was originally owned by Ileana Sonnabend, an art dealer, until her death. She was a friend of Rauschenberg, and considered the piece to be one of her favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/arts/design/moma-gains-treasure-that-metropolitan-museum-of-art-also-coveted.html|title=MoMA Gains Treasure That Met Also Coveted|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=28 November 2012|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnabend's heirs were forced to donate the piece after the [[IRS]] established the piece's value at $65 million and charged the Sonnabends $29 million in taxes. However, due to the bald eagle attached to the canvas, sale of the painting is a felony; as such, the estate's appraisers had placed a value of $0 on the painting, so forcing the heirs to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/28/robert-rauschenbergs-canyon_n_2203680.html|title=Robert Rauschenberg's 'Canyon' Donated To MoMA (PHOTO)|last=Brooks|first=Katherine|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before its donation to MoMA, the piece was displayed on and off at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], due to an earlier conflict between Sonnabend and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] over the piece, which forced Sonnabend to allow ''Canyon'' to be displayed publicly in order to keep it in her possession. Although MoMA ultimately won out, the Met also attempted to persuade Sonnabend's family to donate the piece to their institution.

''Canyon'' has been part of MoMA's permanent collection since 2012. After the work was accessioned, a show celebrating both it and Sonnabend titled ''Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New'' was held at MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/arts/design/ileana-sonnabend-ambassador-for-the-new-at-moma.html?_r=0|title=A Legendary Dealer’s Eagle Eye|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=19 December 2013|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The painting is featured in [[Eugene Lim|Eugene Lim's]] 2017 novel ''[[Dear Cyborgs]]''.

The '''Cathedral of Cefalù''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Cefalù}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Basilica#Ecclesiastical_basilicas|basilica]] in [[Cefalù]], [[Sicily]]. It is one of nine structures included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] known as [[Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalù and Monreale]].

The [[cathedral]] was erected in 1131 in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] architectural style, the island of Sicily having been [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquered by the Normans]] in 1091. According to tradition, the building was erected after a vow made to the Holy Saviour by the King of Sicily, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]], after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and, seen from a distance, it dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.

==History==
[[File:Cefalù dal monte.JPG|thumb|280px|Cefalù Cathedral within the town]]
The cathedral was built in a long-populated area, as attested by the presence of a Roman road and a Paleo-Christian mosaic. Construction began in 1131, the apse [[mosaic]]s were begun in 1145, and the sarcophagi that Roger II provided for his tomb and that of his wife were put in place the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demus|first1=Otto|title=The Mosiacs of Norman Sicily|publisher=Hackert Art Books|isbn=978-0878173105|pages=3-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] moved the two sarcophagi to the [[Cathedral of Palermo]].  Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the façade being completed in 1240. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by [[Rodolphe de Chevriêres]], [[Bishop of Albano]].

In 1472 a [[portico]], by Ambrogio da [[Como]], was added between the two towers of the facade.

==Description==

===Architecture===
[[File:Cefalù Duomo.jpg|thumb|Lateral view]]
The cathedral is preceded by a large terraced [[parvis]], which was originally a cemetery. According to tradition, it was created with earth brought from [[Jerusalem]], which was believed to have qualities that caused the rapid [[mummy|mummification]] of corpses.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The façade is characterized by two large Norman towers with [[mullion]]ed windows, each surmounted by a small spire added in the 15th century. Each spire is different: one has a square plan surrounded by flame-shaped [[merlon]]s, the latter symbolizing the Papal authority and the [[mitre]]; the other has an octagonal plan and Ghibelline merlons, symbolizing the Royal and temporal power.

The 15th-century portico has three arches, the two outer being pointed, supported by four columns and vaulting ribs. Under the portico is the ''Porta Regum'' (Kings' Door), with a finely decorated marble portal flanked by wall paintings.

The interior of the cathedral is on the Latin cross plan, divided into a nave and two aisles by arcades of antique columns: fourteen in pink granite and two in [[cipolin]]. The bases and capitals are from the 2nd century AD. Two large capitals supporting the [[triumphal arch]] of the nave were probably made by an [[Apulia|Apulian]] workshop in the mid-12th century.
[[File:Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg|thumb|Interior view towards the chancel]]
The roof of the nave was lowered, as can be seen from the exterior of the building. The [[transept]] is higher than both the nave and aisles. While parts of the building are barrel-vaulted and parts have an open timber roof, the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] has a ribbed vault of stone.

Beyond the crossing, the church is unusual in combining a style that is essentially Romanesque in its massive simple forms with the pointed (or ogival) arch. This feature is also seen in [[Monreale Cathedral]]. It is a forerunner of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style which was to develop in the region of [[Paris]] within a few years.

The church has three [[apse]]s, an arrangement also seen in Sicily at Monreale Cathedral. The two lower side apses have the upper tiers of the exterior decorated by blind arcading of small crossed arches and sculpted [[corbel]]s, also seen used extensively at Monreale. The corbels date from 1215-1223 and portray masks, heads of animals, and human figures in contorted positions. The corbels of the central apse are more recent. The central apse originally had three large ocular windows,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rose window]]&lt;/ref&gt; which were later closed to give space for the mosaic, and a larger central window of ogival shape. Two other pairs of circular windows are located at the transept's ends.

====Cloister====
The cathedral has a cloister that can be entered from within the church. The arcade has pointed arches, each of which rests on slender, paired columns. The form is not different from that of Spanish and some French cloisters; the composite capitals of the coupled columns are Norman and other more generically Romanesque in their motifs. This cloister is the model for the successive Norman cloisters of Sicily, in particular that of the [[Monreale]].

====Presbyterium mosaic====
[[File:Duomo cefalu msu2017-0740.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantokrator]].]]
[[File:Mosaico della Cattedrale di Cefalù.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Virgin Mary]] with four [[archangels]].]]
It was probably planned that the entire church be decorated in [[mosaic]], but this was completed only in the [[presbyterium]] area. Mosaic still covers the apse and about half of the side walls. Roger II brought masters in the technique of mosaic from [[Constantinople]]. They adapted their traditional Byzantine decorative art to an architectural structure that was of northern European origin.

The dominant figure of the decorative scheme is the bust of [[Christ Pantokrator]], portrayed on the [[semi-dome]] of the [[apse]] with a hand raised in [[Benediction]]. In his left hand he carries the [[Gospel of John]], in which can be read, in Greek and Latin: "I am the light of the world, who follows me will not wander in the darkness but will have the light of life" ([[Gospel of John|John]], {{bibleverse-nb||John|8:12|KJV}}).

In the upper tier of the apsidal wall is depicted the Blessed Virgin Mary, her hands raised in prophecy, flanked by four [[archangel]]s. In the second and third tiers, on either side of the central window, are figures of [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]], placed according to a planned theological programme.

The mosaic decoration extends into the presbyterium, with the side walls showing figures of prophets and saints. On the right wall, adjacent to the royal throne, are royal figures, while on the left side, adjacent the bishop's throne, are priestly figures. Each figure is accompanied by an inscription, in Greek or Latin, describing the character portrayed. The decoration of the cross-vaulted ceiling depicts four [[cherubim]] and four [[seraphim]].

The chief figures, that of Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Mary, are clothed in blue, given luminosity by a background of gold tiles. The work is of the highest order, displaying elegance in the draping of the figures' robes and in the sensitivity of their faces and gestures. It is considered the finest Byzantine mosaic in Italy and comparable to other fine Late Byzantine work from Constantinople.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Byzantine mosaic decoration was completed before 1170. The lower part and the side walls of the presbyterium were not completed until the 17th century. They covered preceding paintings of which scarce traces remain today.

====Other artwork====
[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|The cathedral at night]]
Of the original painted decoration, a figure of [[Urban V]] from the late 14th century, on a column on the left aisle; and a "Madonna enthroned" from the 15th century, in the left arm of the transept, remain.

The basilica houses several funerary monuments, including a late Antique sarcophagus, a medieval one, and the notable sepulchre of the Bishop Castelli of the 18th century.

The 12th-century baptismal font, carved from a single block of stone, is decorated with four small sculpted lions. The church also houses a canvas of the Madonna from [[Antonello Gagini]]'s workshop (16th century) and a painted wooden cross by Guglielmo da Pesaro (1468). The organ is a large two-manual instrument with detached console and plain pipework, sitting above a panelled wooden case.

The nave's ceiling has a painted decoration with busts, fanciful animals and other motifs, probably the work of Arabic craftsmen.

Starting in 1985, the Palermo artist Michele Canzoneri was commissioned and has installed 72 modern, abstract, stained-glass windows based on episodes from the Old and New Testaments. These have aroused some controversy for their style.&lt;ref&gt;Grady, Ellen, ''Blue Guide Sicily,'' 7th Edition, Somerset Books, London, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palæo-Christian mosaic====
Excavations in the cathedral area have brought to light parts of a 6th-century polychrome mosaic. They depict a dove drinking, parts of two other birds, two small trees, and a lily-shaped flower, enclosed in a frame with ogival and lozenge motifs.

This mosaic belonged probably to a pre-existing Byzantine basilica. This area of Cefalù was frequented at least up to the 8th century, when it was an [[episcopal see]].

The '''Chimera of Arezzo''' is regarded as the best example of ancient [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Mark. “Chimera of Arezzo.” Ancient History Encyclopedia, 13 Jan. 2017, www.ancient.eu/article/1006/chimera-of-arezzo/.&lt;/ref&gt; British art historian, David Ekserdjian, described the sculpture as "one of the most arresting of all animal sculptures and the supreme masterpiece of Etruscan bronze-casting."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;Dobrzynski, Judith H. “The Imaginary Made Nearly Real.” The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones &amp; Company, 8 Feb. 2013, www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323539804578264234269625580.&lt;/ref&gt;  Made entirely of bronze and measuring 78.5&amp;nbsp;cm high with a length of 129&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/chimaera_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; it was found alongside a small collection of other bronze statues in [[Arezzo]], an ancient Etruscan and Roman city in [[Tuscany]]. The statue was originally part of a larger sculptural group representing a fight between a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] and the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]]. This sculpture was likely created as a [[votive]] offering to the Etruscan god [[Tinia]].

== History of the Chimera ==
According to [[Greek mythology]] the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] or "she-goat" was a monstrous, fire-breathing hybrid creature of [[Lycia]] in [[Asia Minor]], created by the binding of multiple animal parts to create a singular unnatural creature. As the offspring of [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna]], the Chimera ravaged the lands of Lycia at a disastrous pace.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 319-25&lt;/ref&gt; Distressed by the destruction of his lands, the king of Lycia, [[Iobates]], ordered a young warrior named [[Bellerophon]] to slay the dreaded Chimera, also as a favor to a neighboring king, [[Proetus]]. Proteus wanted Bellerophon dead because his wife accused him of ravishing her, and he assumed that the warrior would perish in the attempt to kill the beast. Bellerophon set out on his winged horse, [[Pegasus]], and emerged victorious from his battle, eventually winning not only the hand of Iobates' daughter but also his kingdom. It is this story that led art historians to believe that the Chimera of Arezzo was originally part of a group sculpture that included Bellerophon and Pegasus. Votive offerings for the Gods often depicted mythological stories. A round hole on the left rump of the Chimera might suggest a spot where Bellerophon may have struck the beast with a now-missing spear.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; The first known literary reference was in Homer's ''Iliad'', and the epic poetry of [[Hesiod]] in the 8th century BCE also mentions the Chimera.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009–February 8, 2010". J. Paul Getty Museum. Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In response to questions of the statue's true meaning, [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] wrote in his ''Reasonings Over the Inventions He Painted in Florence in the Palace of Their Serene Highnesses'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yes, sir, because there are the medals of the Duke my lord who came from Rome with a goat's head stuck in the neck of this lion, who as he sees VE, also has the serpent's belly, and we found the queue that was broken between those bronze fragments with many metal figurines that you've seen all, and the wounds that she has touched on show it, and yet the pain that is known in the readiness of the head of this animal ..."&lt;ref&gt;Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli and Mario Torelli, The Art of Classical Antiquity, Etruria-Rome , Turin, Utet, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The tail was not restored until 1785 when the [[Pistoia|Pistoiese]] sculptor [[Francesco Carradori]] (or his teacher, [[Innocenzo Spinazzi]]) fashioned a replacement, incorrectly positioning the serpent to bite the goat's horn. It is much more likely that the snake had to strike out against Bellerophon instead, since biting the head of the goat meant it was biting itself. Inscribed on its right foreleg is an inscription in the ancient Etruscan language. It has been variously deciphered, but most recently it is thought to read TINSCVIL, meaning: "Offering belonging to Tinia",&lt;ref&gt;TLE 663; Bonfante and Bonfante 2002, no. 26 p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the bronze was a [[votive object]] dedicated to the supreme Etruscan god of day, Tin or Tinia. The original statue is estimated to have been created around 400 BCE.[[File:Chimaira, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Chimera, Nordisk familjebok]] In 1718, the sculpture was transported to the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and later, along with the remaining collection Cosimo I had originally seized, taken to the [[Palazzo della Crocetta]]. Court intellectuals of the time considered the Chimera of Arezzo to be a symbol of the Medici domination of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. Its permanent residence is in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Florence]] where it was placed on brief loan to the [[Getty Villa]] for an exhibition in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The sculpture was probably commissioned by an aristocratic clan or a prosperous community and erected in a religious sanctuary near the ancient Etruscan town of Arezzo, about 50 miles southeast of Florence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chimera was one of a [[hoard]] of bronzes that had been carefully buried for safety sometime in [[classical antiquity]]. A bronze replica now stands near the spot of its original discovery.

=== The Etruscans ===
The  [[Etruscan civilization]] was a wealthy civilization in ancient Italy with roots in the ancient region of [[Etruria]], which existed during the early 8th-6th century BCE and extended over what is now a part of modern [[Tuscany]], western [[Umbria]], and northern [[Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Etruscans, an introduction", Laurel Taylor, Khan Academy&lt;/ref&gt; The region became a part of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman-Etruscan Wars]].

Heavily influenced by [[Ancient Greek]] culture, [[Etruscan art]] is characterized by the use of terracotta, [[metalworking]]—especially in bronze—as well as jewelry and [[engraved gems]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Macanamara, Ellen. The Etrustcans, British Museum 1991. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Metal and bronze trinkets from the [[Mediterranean]] rapidly began to appear around Etruria. It is not clear to historians exactly when trading with the Eastern Mediterranean began, however it is clear that both [[Phoenicians]] and Greeks must have been interested in the metal ores of Etruria, causing a rise in popularity of the art trade in these regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Etruscans were well known for their art throughout the [[Orientalizing Period]] 700-600 BCE, The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]] 600-480 BCE, and the [[Hellenistic Period]] 2nd to 1st century BCE.

=== The discovery ===
Discovered on November 15, 1553 by constructions workers near the San Lorentio gate in Arezzo (ancient [[Arretium]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/english.html#rediscovery|title=The Chimaera of Arezzo (Getty Villa Exhibitions)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture was quickly claimed for the collection of the [[Medici]] [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]], [[Cosimo I]], who placed it publicly in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in the hall of [[Leo X]]. Cosimo also placed the smaller bronzes from the trove in his own ''[[Cabinet (room)|studiolo]]'' at [[Palazzo Pitti]], where "the Duke took great pleasure in cleaning them by himself, with some goldsmith's tools," as [[Benvenuto Cellini]] reported in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Cellini, Benvenuto, and John Addington Symonds. 1955. The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini. N.Y.: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; On discovery, the statue was missing the snake and its left front and rear paws.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/english.html#rediscovery|title=The Chimaera of Arezzo (Getty Villa Exhibitions)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its fragmented state upon discovery, the statue was originally regarded as a lion. Italian painter [[Giorgio Vasari]] tracked down the statue motif by studying Ancient Greek and Roman coins, such as a silver ''stater''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; featuring an image of the Chimera, thus accurately identifying it. Eventually, it was officially identified as being a part of a larger piece illustrating a fight between the Chimera and the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]]. The sculpture was found among other small pieces that served as [[votive]] offerings to the God [[Tinia]]. This sculpture may also have served as an Etruscan religious dedication. After discovery, it began its residence in Florence where it remained until its transportation in 1718 to the [[Uffizi Palace]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009–February 8, 2010". J. Paul Getty Museum. "Discovery" Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1870, the Chimaera of Arezzo has made its home at the National Archaeological Museum in Florence. As the sculpture made its way through the Florence museums, it increasingly attracted the attention of both artists and historians.

== Iconography ==
Typical [[iconography]] of the Chimera myth depicts the warrior [[Bellerophon]] as he confronts the Chimera, or rides atop or alongside [[chimera (mythology)|it]]. This iconography began to appear upon Greek vessels in 600 BCE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chimera of Arezzo presents a very detailed and complex composition that most likely was meant for display and viewing in the round. The Chimera is clearly expressing pain throughout its body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Its form is contorted, its face and mouth open in outrage as it is struck by Bellerophon. Similar to [[Hellenistic]] sculpture, the Chimera's form and body language express movement as well as the clear tension and power of the beast's musculature and evoke in the viewer a feeling of deep emotional pain and interest in the contemplation of that movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
[[File:Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 05.JPG|thumb|Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 05]]
[[File:Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 07.JPG|thumb|Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 07]]
Clearly influenced by [[Mediterranean]] myth culture, this bronze work is evidence of the mastery that Etruscan sculptors had not only over the medium but of mythological lore. Art historian A. Maggiani gives details of a clear [[Italiote]] context by pointing out iconographic comparisons from sites in [[Magna Graecia]] such as [[Metaponto]] and [[Kaulonia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Italiote refers to a pre-Roman empire Greek-speaking population in southern Italy. Magna Graecia refers to the Greek colonies which were established in southern Italy from the 8th century BCE onwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the Italiote context in mind, these trends are a clear indication of the increasing popularity of [[Attic]] or Athens-inspired architecture and sculpture. Ancient Athenians regarded themselves among the highest of society. Their art, religion, and culture was seen as the epitome of Greek achievement. While the ancient Athenians had long since perished by this time, their work and way of life were still regarded with great fascination and there was a desire to emulate it. Historians have generally come to a consensus that the Chimera of Arezzo was produced by [[Italiote]] craftsmen in the last decades of the fifth century BCE or in the beginning of the fourth century BCE. The fact that this sculpture was a votive offering to Tinia is a reminder of the wealth and sophistication of Etruscan elites.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Becker, Jeffery A. “Chimera of Arezzo (Article) | Etruscan.” Khan Academy, www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/etruscan/a/chimera-of-arezzo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and materials ==
In the 3rd millennium BCE ancient foundry workers discovered by trial and error that bronze had distinct advantages over pure [[copper]] for making artistic statuary. [[Bronze]] stays liquid longer when filling a mold due to its lower [[melting point]]. Bronze is a superior metal than copper for sculpture casting because of its higher tensile strength.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Hemingway, Authors: Seán Hemingway Colette. “The Technique of Bronze Statuary in Ancient Greece | Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art.” The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grbr/hd_grbr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Cyprus]] supplied most of the bronze used for artistic purposes throughout the ancient Mediterranean region.

The earliest forms of Greek bronze sculptures were simple, hand-worked sheets of bronze known as ''sphyrelaton'' (literally, “hammer-driven”).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Like modern clay sculpture, these metal sheets could be embellished by hammering the metal over various wooden shapes made with textures that created a desired look or depth. This was later adapted to become the technique known today as [[tracing (art)|tracing]]. By the late Archaic period (ca. 500–480 B.C.) ''sphyrelaton'' lost popularity as [[lost-wax]] casting became the primary form of bronze sculpting. Lost-wax casting of bronze was achieved in three different ways, each with its own desired effects. The first and earliest method was [[solid]] casting, which required a model of the sculpture to be fashioned in solid wax and then carved. The second method was hollow [[lost-wax]] casting, which was created by a direct process. Finally, the third was hollow [[lost-wax]] casting by an indirect process. The model is packed in clay, and then heated in what today would be similar to a [[kiln]] to remove the wax and harden the clay. Then, the mold is inverted and metal poured inside it to create a cast. When cooled, the [[bronze]]-[[Metalsmith|smith]] cracks open the clay model to reveal a solid bronze replica.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For smaller details, sculptors often made eyes out of glass and painted on body hair, clothing details, and skin color. Lost in antiquity, most historical knowledge of how certain bronze statues would have looked comes from studying surviving Roman [[marble]] copies.

The '''Cleveland Centennial half dollar''' is [[early United States commemorative coins|a commemorative]] [[half dollar (United States coin)|United States half dollar]] struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] in 1936 and 1937, though all bear the earlier date. Sometimes known as the '''Cleveland Centennial Great Lakes Exposition half dollar''', it was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], as an incorporated city, and in commemoration of the [[Great Lakes Exposition]], held in Cleveland in 1936.

In the mid-1930s, commemorative coins were increasing in value, and Cincinnati businessman [[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin collector, lobbied Congress to authorize several new issues, of which he would be the sole distributor. He was successful with the [[Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]], from which he profited greatly, and with the Cleveland piece. [[Brenda Putnam]] designed the Cleveland coin, which was approved by the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] after suggestions by sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]].

Melish distributed the Cleveland coins through the exposition, at local banks, and by mail order from his office in Cincinnati. Sales were good, and the full authorized mintage of 50,000 was struck.  Congress had inserted safeguards in the legislation to curb excessive profits, and though some of the coins were minted in 1937, there was no change of date, meaning collectors would only have to purchase one piece to have a complete set. Thousands remained in dealer inventories for years, and the coins remain inexpensive by the standards of commemorative coins of the era.

== Background ==
{{further information|History of Cleveland}}
After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the area known as the [[Western Reserve]], now in eastern Ohio, was the subject of dispute among the states, several of which claimed it as part of their territory. Although political rights to the area were given up to the federal government, Connecticut kept land ownership, and used part of its holdings to resettle those whose homes had been destroyed by the British during the war. The remainder was sold to the [[Connecticut Land Company]] in 1795. [[Moses Cleaveland]] was a surveyor, a lawyer, and one of the company's directors.  In 1796, by the shores of [[Lake Erie]], he set out a townsite that came to bear his name.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=111–112}} In 1830, a newspaper was founded, to be called the ''Cleaveland Advertiser''.  The editor found the name one character too long to fit in the printing form, and dropped the first "a" in Cleaveland—a change that was adopted by the public.  The town of [[Cleveland]] became a city in 1836.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=73–74}}

[[File:Melish picture.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thomas G. Melish]]
[[Thomas G. Melish]] was a prominent Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company.{{sfn|Horning|p=30}}  Melish was also a coin collector, who came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control.{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3–5}} The result was the 1936 [[Cincinnati Music Center half dollar]], an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=329–330}} Melish sold only a few coins at the issue price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher.{{sfn|Flynn|p=71}} By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to [[Q. David Bowers]], "as hot as a volcano",{{sfn|Bowers|p=26}} and "Congress gave [Melish] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!"{{sfn|Bowers|p=18}} Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative issues that he would control.  The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}}

== Legislation ==
A bill for a Cleveland Centennial half dollar was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] by Ohio's [[Robert J. Bulkley]] on March 23, 1936, and it was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking and Currency]].  The bill was to honor both the 100th anniversary of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, and the [[Great Lakes Exposition]], to be held there in 1936. The original bill would have provided for 50,000 pieces, which could be purchased from the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] at any time, and could be struck by any or all of the three mints then in operation. The bill was reported back to the House by committee chairman [[Alva B. Adams]] of Colorado on March 26, drastically amended.&lt;ref name = "senate committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 4335|publisher=United States Senate|date=March 26, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/pqpresultpage.gispdfhitspanel.pdflink/$2fapp-bin$2fgis-billtext$2fa$2f6$2fd$2f1$2f74-s4335-000rs-19360326.pdf+/4335,+74,+S.$40$2fapp-gis$2fbilltext$2f74_s_4335_rs_19360326$40Bill+Text$40Bill+Text$40March+26,+1936?pgId=236d0b6d-cfd0-48e0-9efe-96a07b009f11&amp;rsId=14EB0CC947E}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams had held hearings on other commemorative coins on March 11, 1936, and had separately been told of the abuses as issuers sought to get collectors to buy their coins.  These included getting additional designs authorized (as in the case of the [[Arkansas Centennial half dollar]]) and having the coins struck at all three mints. As the law required coins to bear the year of striking, and because [[mint mark]]s were used on coins produced at some mints, striking them in successive years at multiple mints created more [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] that coin enthusiasts would have to buy to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Senate hearings|pp=11–12}} The committee heard of the [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]], authorized in 1926 and still being struck in 1936, and of commemorative coins created with intentionally low mintages as a way of inflating profits.{{sfn|Senate hearings|pp=20–21}} When legislation for a Cleveland half dollar came before his committee, Adams struck the entire bill, after the [[list of enacting clauses|enacting clause]], and substituted a new version.  The original legislation had given the Cleveland Centennial Commemorative Coin Committee, controlled by Melish, discretion to have the new piece struck at any of the mints, at any time even over the course of years, in any amount up to the authorized limit of 50,000.  Adams's new text kept the total limit, but set a minimum of 25,000 that had to be issued. Adams's amendment required that all the coins be of a single design, be struck at a single mint (to be selected by the [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]]).  It provided that all the coins be dated 1936 even if struck later, and that the Cleveland committee could purchase no less than 5,000 at a time.&lt;ref name = "senate committee" /&gt; In a separate report, Senator Adams noted that Bulkley's original bill "contains certain provisions which the committee recommends be eliminated not only from such bill but also from all subsequent bills relating to the issuance of commemorative coins."&lt;ref name = "senate report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calendar No. 1805|publisher=United States Senate|date=March 26, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/congressional/pqpdocumentview:pdfannexevent?pgId=868a3376-8c06-40a1-ba30-8dc970c36e33&amp;rsId=14EB0C72BCD&amp;pdf=app-bin/gis-serialset/a/5/9/6/9988_srp1728_from_1_to_1.pdf}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded vote on March 27, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|4489|date=March 27, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred it to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating the possibility that the committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more.&lt;ref name = "house committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 4335|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=April 16, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/pqpresultpage.gispdfhitspanel.pdflink/$2fapp-bin$2fgis-billtext$2f9$2f1$2ff$2f7$2f74-s4335-000rh-19360416.pdf+/4335,+74,+S.$40$2fapp-gis$2fbilltext$2f74_s_4335_rh_19360416$40Bill+Text$40Bill+Text$40April+16,+1936?pgId=61263787-7724-4eba-87ec-23050d13c9a0&amp;rsId=14EB241A90A}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by [[John Joseph Cochran]] of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for [[unanimous consent]] to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's [[Robert F. Rich]] asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill.  Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's [[Robert Crosser]] and been informed that "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless".&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6012–6013|date=April 23, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did,&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6048|date=April 24, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on May 5, 1936.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}}

== Preparation ==
[[Brenda Putnam]], a well-known sculptor, was engaged to design the coin.{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}}  On May 1, even before Roosevelt signed the legislation, the Director of the Mint, [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], sent sketches that had been submitted by Putnam to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]].  That commission had been charged by President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s 1921 [[executive order]] with rendering advisory opinions on the designs of public artworks, including coins.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v–vi, 190}} On May 2, commission chairman Charles Moore responded to Ross, giving preliminary approval, and stating that one of its members would work with Putnam as she prepared the necessary plaster models.  That representative was [[Lee Lawrie]], who suggested to Putnam that she use stars to represent the cities of the [[Great Lakes]] region.  Putnam had placed, on the map on the reverse, sketches of buildings to represent the sites of Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Toronto. When Lawrie wrote to Moore to report this and other progress, Moore joked about the coin having an enlarged star for Cleveland,
{{quote|
At funerals I hear read the Scriptures to the effect that "one star differeth from another in glory".{{efn|1 Corinthians 15:41}} So I suppose Miss Putnam's big star for Cleveland refers to the glory rather than the size of the city.  Well, as a voter in Detroit{{efn|Both Detroit and Chicago were and are larger in population than Cleveland.}} I don't mind, and probably no Chicago person will ever see one of the coins.  I am convinced that the whole movement is a coin-collector's racket that is going on all over the country.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=190–193}}
}}

Putnam's models were approved by the commission on June 2, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=193}} The [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York reduced the models to half-dollar sized [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]] from which coinage dies could be prepared.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}}

== Design ==
[[File:General Moses Cleaveland.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moses Cleaveland, by an unknown artist|alt=The man from the coin, Moses Cleaveland, in an engraving. He is seen more fully than on the coin, facing slightly right, and wears late 18th or early 19th century garb.  He appears about 50 years old and has a sour expression on his face.]]

Putnam's obverse features Moses Cleaveland,{{sfn|Flynn|p=73}} in a depiction based on the only known portrait of him, by an unknown artist.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=48}} Surrounding Cleaveland are two lines of inscription, &lt;small&gt;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA * HALF DOLLAR&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;MOSES CLEAVELAND * LIBERTY&lt;/small&gt;. The designer's initials, "PB", are beneath Cleaveland's head. The reverse shows a map of the Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities, listed from west to east: '''Duluth''', '''Milwaukee''', '''Chicago''', '''Toledo''', '''Detroit''', '''Cleveland''', '''Buffalo''', '''Toledo''' and '''Rochester'''. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass.{{sfn|Flynn|p=73}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their book on commemoratives, stated that "we have not found documentation, but we suspect that the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, but New York, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=47}} The other inscriptions required by law appear in the upper right of the reverse, and &lt;small&gt;1836 GREAT LAKES EXPOSITION 1936 CLEVELAND CENTENNIAL&lt;/small&gt; surround the map.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=110}}

Numismatist David Bullowa, in his early work on commemoratives, stated, "the design of this issue is pleasing&amp;nbsp;... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, interesting and not crowded".{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920s and 1930s."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=193}}  After complaining about the flat design and the large amount of lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, "the bust of Moses Cleaveland can only be described as commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=193}} Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=194}}

== Production, distribution, and collecting ==
[[File:1936 50C Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The [[Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]], Melish's other coin.|alt=Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]]
Melish, in his capacity as treasurer of the Cleveland committee, ordered 25,000 pieces in July 1936.  They were shipped from the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where they were struck, on July 20.{{sfn|Bowers|p=339}}  As well as those pieces, 15 coins were struck and set aside for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}} Melish had arranged for the Philadelphia Mint to place the first 201 struck into individual numbered envelopes; these were later placed in special cardboard holders, the first by itself and each two thereafter together, with a notarized statement from Melish.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=316}}

The Cleveland Centennial and Great Lakes Exposition opened on June 27, 1936, and before it closed on October 4, some four million people passed through its gates.  Located on a 150-acre (61 ha) site by the shores of Lake Erie, there were artistic and industrial exhibits, as well as the usual amusements.{{sfn|Bowers|p=337}} The half dollars were sold at the fairgrounds, at Ohio banks, and by mail order from Melish's office in Cincinnati. Editor Lee Hewitt commented in the ''Numismatic Scrapbook'', "it seems strange that Mr. Melish, living in Cincinnati, should be the distributor of the Cleveland issue."{{sfn|Bowers|pp=338–339}} The Cincinnati Musical Center coin had quickly sold out, the pieces Melish allowed on the market many times oversubscribed,{{sfn|Bowers|p=339}} but for the Cleveland piece, "Melish's sales strategy had to be very different; the coins would have to be aimed at the Exposition visitors and the general public at $1.50 each, not at his own coterie of greedy speculators".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=48}}

Melish sent form letters to collectors warning that his committee had received offers from speculators to buy the entire issue and suggesting they act quickly to get their orders in.  By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand soon would be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity.  In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission.  Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=339–341}} In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance on face value.  Kosoff, who would, after Melish's death, auction his coin collection, declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1941, the Western Reserve Coin Club of Cleveland celebrated its 20th anniversary by [[Glossary of numismatics#C|countermarking]] 100 Cleveland Centennial half dollars with a special design.  The Secret Service objected, and many were destroyed. The club made similar markings for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, without government interference.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=316–317}} The Cleveland Centennial coin is the most common commemorative of the many different designs struck in 1936. [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2015, lists the issue at between $215 and $300, depending on condition.  An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $4,700.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1150}}

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Fishermen at Sea - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Fishermen at Sea'', 1796, the first oil painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to be exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], in 1796]]

'''''Fishermen at Sea''''', sometimes known as the '''''Cholmeley Sea Piece''''', is an early oil painting by English artist [[J. M. W. Turner]].  It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1796, and has been owned by the [[Tate Gallery]] since 1972.  

The painting measures {{convert|36|x|48.125|in|cm}}.  It depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near [[the Needles]], off the [[Isle of Wight]].  It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background.  The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butlin| first=Martin| title=The paintings of J.M.W.

The work shows strong influence from the work of marine artists such as [[Claude Joseph Vernet]], [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]], [[Peter Monamy]] and [[Francis Swaine]], and the intimate nocturnal scenes of [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].  The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=28| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian [[Andrew Wilton]] has commented that the image: "Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1|page=27|edition=New }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Walter Thornbury]], the work was sold to General Stewart for £10. The painting was acquired by Sir [[Henry Charles Englefield]]; after his death in 1822, it was sold at [[Christie's]] on 8 March 1823, as ''View of the Needles, with the effect of Moon and Fire Light''. It was bought by Englefield's nephew Francis Cholmeley, and it remained in the Cholmeley family for nearly 150 years, displayed at [[Brandsby Hall]], and it became known as the ''Cholmeley Sea Piece''.   It was loaned regularly to the Tate Gallery from 1931, and sold to the Tate Gallery in 1972 by [[Francis William Alfred Fairfax-Cholmeley]], with finance from the Beatrice Lizzie Benson Fund.

==Synopsis==
The story follows numerous simple people from the same poor and rural region of Sayala which is located in [[Bahary]], [[Alexandria]]. On the other hand, there is a completely different and classy atmosphere, an old billionaire and his family in Cairo. The old man had known that he has a son from a third wife from Sayala which made him feel utterly ashamed of himself. As result, he decides to write his will giving his newly known son the big share of his money and assets, that action made his family so distressed, as they don't even know they have another kid from another wife, moreover, he comes from a much lower social class. So, the events become more complicated when it's about time to execute the will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article21933|title=عفاريت السيالة (المحتوى، التقنيات، الشخصية) - ديوان العرب|website=www.diwanalarab.com|language=ar|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflicts start when Saleh El-Hamouli decides to disappear. After Maghouri starts to get cash and direct help from others, his life changes into a luxurious style, also his family. On the other hand, Qesmat Hanem and her family couldn't bear the unexpected distribution of money and assets, and the suspicious appearance of Maghaouri, so they start battles legally and through other ways.

The first scene of the series is somehow an overall conception of the events and also the moral philosophy of the story, the scene set in a local cafe in Sayala, and then starts the monologue-wise conversation between an old man (A'am Asaliya) and a falsely claimed reporter, the old man spoke frankly and modestly about his long stay in the urban area, his views on the people and how poverty sometimes might create a cooperative little communities and more strong beliefs and ethics, though, the evil always come from many ways. There are many scenes in almost every episode in the show which we can find portraits of these thoughts or even through a blunt dramatic dialogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">The '''Gurdjieff movements''' is a series of [[sacred dance]]s that were collected or authored by [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] and taught to his students as part of the work of ''self observation'' and ''self study''.

Gurdjieff taught that the movements were not merely [[calisthenics]], exercises in concentration, and displays of bodily coordination and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic sensibility]]: on the contrary, in the movements was embedded real, concrete knowledge, passed from generation to generation of initiates - each posture and gesture representing some cosmic [[truth]] that the informed observer could read like a book. Certain of Gurdjieff's followers claim that the Gurdjieff Movements can only be properly transmitted by those who themselves have been initiated in the direct line of Gurdjieff; otherwise, they say, it leads nowhere.

The movements are purportedly based upon traditional dances that Gurdjieff studied as he traveled throughout [[central Asia]], India, Tibet, the Orient and [[Africa]] where he encountered various Indo-European and [[Sufi]] orders, [[Buddhist]] centers and other sources of traditional culture and learning.&lt;ref name="ToussulisPh.D2011"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Moore also re- ports that an extensive study of Mevlevi (Sufi) music and movements was conducted by Gurdjieff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurdjieff insists that the main source as well as the unique symbol of the [[Fourth Way Enneagram|Enneagram]] was transmitted to him as an initiate in the [[Sarmoung Brotherhood|Sarmoung Monastery]]. There were literally thousands of movements collected and taught by Gurdjieff throughout his teaching career. The music for the movements was written by Gurdjieff and [[Thomas de Hartmann]], as well as British composer Edouard Michael.

A brief glimpse of the dances appears at the very end of the motion picture about Gurdjieff, ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', produced and directed in 1978 by [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref name="PanafieuNeedleman1997"&gt;{{cite book

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernism''' is a cultural, artistic, literary and architectural successor to [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]] in which the form (attribute) of an object has no context distinct from its function.  Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time.  Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes (most conspicuously physical form) as discordant with function.  While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the "box" or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box (reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value) so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous.  Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute.  Synchrony between previously-clashing objects (now attributes) and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it.

==Relationship to modernism and postmodernism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Post-modernism and modernism debated each another in an industrial/physical context and were concerned with the social value of objects themselves.  Modernism focused on confining form within the limited function of a 1950s object while 1970's postmodernism focused on freeing form from its limited function ("there-is-no-box"). The modern/postmodern oversight of objects as a mediator between attribute and function led to redundant human-context thinking and false conflicts between objects such as ideas.

==Propelled by technological advances==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Technology has played a definitive role in function catching up to attribute.  An example is the touch-screen in which the attribute on the screen (ratio, shape, color, animation) becomes the focus of interaction as opposed to manipulation by an external tool i.e. cellphone keyboard.  In the long-term the object ceases to become the middleman between attribute (form) and function.

==Non-composability of objects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism holds that an object is by definition non-composable toward its attributes; and no one attribute of an object can act as a proxy for the object itself.  No whole, or object, is reducible to ONLY its attributes; and the attributes may not be mutually exclusive to the object itself.  Furthermore, an object may have extraneous functions independent of its composing attributes (postmodern theory); this potential supra-functionality is a key concern to hypermodernism's attempt to replace objects with attributes.  Attributes, while having the functions of an object, are not building blocks toward an object in hypermodernism.  No object is by definition hypermodern; however, an object can be more hypermodern or less hypermodern than another object.

[[File:Hypermodernism.jpg|thumb|2D aesthetic attributes projected as a 3D object.]]

==Long-term effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism displays a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It can be described as anti-object; however it is NOT anti-materialistic.   Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function.  Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive.  Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear as in the case of the physical keyboard.  Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous.

==Human psychology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism compensates for the tendency of human thought to extract the attributes of an object and assign those same attributes to the functions of the object.  Rather than focusing on a debate over "truth" or non-truth and other high-context social considerations, hypermodernism focuses on questions of extraneous vs non-extraneous (In design terms, correctness and incorrectness).  Hypermodernism emphasizes correctness over completeness in design in order to guard against human intuitive leaps.

The '''Hypogeum of Yarhai''' is a [[hypogeum]] (underground tomb) from the ancient Syrian city of [[Palmyra]] which flourished in the second and third centuries AD. It is considered one of the finest examples of Palmyrene funerary art. It's a mass grave which was built to contain the remains of the Yarhai family who commissioned it to be built in 108 AD.&lt;ref name=darke&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jv2jHT_GRe0C|title=Syria|last=Darke|first=Diana|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jv2jHT_GRe0C&amp;pg=PA113 113]|year=2010|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841623146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypogeum dates back from 108 AD.

"'''I'll Walk You Home'''" is the thirty-fifth episode of the [[Holby City (series 18)|eighteenth series]] of the British [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Holby City]]''. The episode was written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall, and premiered on [[BBC One]] on 7 June 2016. The episode features the death of established character [[Arthur Digby]] ([[Rob Ostlere]]), a [[Modernising Medical Careers|CT2]] doctor who had worked on the show's fictitious Keller and AAU wards. Writers worked alongside a consultant oncologist for medical advice to provide an accurate depiction of terminal cancer. The episode also features the return of two former regular characters and includes an appearance of a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.

The episode was structured with positive and upbeat tones transitioning into the dark scenes focusing on death. "I'll Walk You Home" received positive reviews from critics for its "gritty" theme. All reviews noted that it was an emotional episode. Sarah Deen from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' branded it one of the "saddest episodes ever".

==Plot==
Arthur and his wife [[Modernising Medical Careers|F1]] [[Morven Shreve|Morven Digby]] (Eleanor Fanyinka) announce their decision to go travelling. They want to spend the time Arthur has left visiting historic sites. His best friend [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]) is upset and thinks that Arthur is being selfish. Consultant general surgeon [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]) tries to make Dom realise that it is Arthur's choice. He decides to distract himself by attending to patient Alison Jones (Elizabeth Cadwallader). Dom realises that he has been unfair to Arthur and they have a discussion. Dom hands Arthur war medals that were stolen from their flat months earlier. Arthur realises that he wants to stay in Holby City and live out his final days with friends.

Consultant cardiothoracic surgeon [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]) sets [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]) a series of surgical tasks to prove her worth. Zosia rises to the challenge but becomes tired of Jac's demands. Jac tells Zosia she is selfish and uncaring towards Arthur. She accuses her of giving Arthur a stent operation to advance her own career. Zosia confronts Jac and accuses her of being "cold", this does not phase Jac who ignores her. Zosia ex-boyfriend, [[Specialist registrar]] [[Oliver Valentine]] ([[James Anderson (English actor)|James Anderson]]) and [[Staff nurse]] [[Cara Martinez]] ([[Niamh Walsh]]) apologise to her for sharing a kiss. Cara gives Oliver a picture of his dead wife [[Tara Lo]] ([[Jing Lusi]]) and Zosia spots him with it. [[Staff nurse]] [[Essie Harrison]] ([[Kaye Wragg]]) rallies staff to get ready to perform a song and dance surprise for Arthur. They perform a dance routine and are joined by [[Ethan Hardy]] ([[George Rainsford (actor)|George Rainsford]]). [[Antoine Malick]] ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]) makes a video call to Arthur to wish him well.

Arthur goes to visit CEO [[Henrik Hanssen]] ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) and he tells him that he has finally realised what he wants from life. Arthur's stent bursts and he collapses on the floor. Hanssen calls a crash team and tries to comfort Arthur. [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[Sacha Levy]] ([[Bob Barrett (actor)|Bob Barrett]]) and Ric try to operate on Arthur. Sacha announces that the cancer is too advanced and nothing more can be done and Ric agrees. Hanssen goes to AAU to inform Morven who is in theatre with [[Serena Campbell]] ([[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]]). Arthur is taken into a side room where Morven tells him that she loves him. Arthur is unconscious and has visions of Morven, Dom, Zosia and his old friend [[Chantelle Lane]] ([[Lauren Drummond]]). Arthur responds to Morven holding his hand but then dies surrounded by his friends and colleagues. Zosia breaks down on Darwin ward and Jac rushes to console her.

==Production==
The episode focuses around the final scenes of Rob Ostlere as Arthur Digby following three years in the show. The actor had informed producers of his decision to leave six months prior. They then devised an exit storyline for the character in which he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ostlere was told of their intention to kill the character off, the results of which play out in "I'll Walk You Home".&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The events of the episode could have been different as producer Simon Harper later gave Ostlere the chance to have his character leave the show alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City producers reveal that Rob Ostlere could have saved his character Arthur Digby|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/news/a796974/holby-city-rob-ostlere-arthur-digby-could-have-been-saved/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was produced by Jane Wallbank, written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall.&lt;ref name=episode&gt;{{cite web|title=I'll Walk You Home|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07f72gb|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storyliners had been liaising with a consultant oncologist named Bruce Sizer who gave advice on the medical condition featured in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur's last walk|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03xk5d1|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers structured the episode so it began "lovely and upbeat" until the closing scenes which contained Arthur's death.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt;

Former regular cast members Jimmy Akingbola and Lauren Drummond returned to filming especially for the episode, reprising their roles as Antoine Malick and Chantelle Lane respectively. Akingbola filmed scenes which were featured in a [[Skype]] video call. Drummond filmed scenes with other cast members, with her footage stylised as part of a dream sequence envisioned by Arthur.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The cast were involved in filming a number of dream sequences which were given a "surreal" feeling to them.&lt;ref name=wotint&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arthur's final journey|journal=[[What's on TV]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=15|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Rainsford guest starred as Ethan Hardy, a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. His inclusion was a result of a decision made by executive producer Oliver Kent who oversees both shows. Rainsford and Ostlere had been asking Kent for the scenes for some time. The actors were friends for fourteen years and wanted their characters to share screen-time.&lt;ref name=woti&gt;{{cite web|title='It was a lovely, upbeat episode until Arthur's final moments!'

==Promotion==
Producers wanted to keep exact details of the episode a secret until it was broadcast. They also wanted to Akingbola and Drummond's involvement quiet to surprise viewers.&lt;ref name=insidesoap/&gt; Though Ostlere did disclose that past characters would return in an interview published via ''[[What's on TV]]''.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Advance spoilers only indicated that Arthur and Morven planned to leave ''Holby City'' to go travelling and that Zosia and Jac would feature in scenes on the show's Darwin ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Goodbye Arthur &amp; Morven?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=27|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show released a promotional trailer for the episode a week in advance.

She called Arthur being readmitted to hospital "the most heartbreaking scenes". The scene involving Zosia and Jac breaking down in each other's arms "left viewers completely overcome with emotion".

'''''Keum-boo''''' (also '''''Kum-Boo''''' or '''''Kum-bu'''''—[[Korean language|Korean]] "attached gold") is an ancient [[Korea]]n [[gilding]] technique used to apply thin sheets of [[gold]] to [[silver]], to make [[silver-gilt]]. Traditionally, this technique is accomplished by first [[depletion gilding#Variations|depleting]] a surface of [[sterling silver]] to bring up a thin layer of [[Millesimal fineness#Silver|fine silver]]. Then [[Millesimal fineness#Gold|24 carat]] [[Metal leaf|gold foil]] is applied with heat and pressure—[[Gilding#Mechanical gilding|mechanical gilding]]—to produce a permanent [[diffusion]] bond. 

Pure precious metals such as gold and silver have a very similar [[atomic structure]] and therefore have a good potential for bonding. Heating these metals to a temperature between 500–700°F increases the movement of the atoms. When pressure is added, this causes an electron exchange at the surface between the two metals, creating a permanent diffusion bond. This diffusion bond occurs far below the [[brazing|soldering]] temperature for either metal (Dhein, 2004).

Examples of this technique have probably been observed, but not positively identified on pieces from the second half of the first millennium B.C. and from the early first millennium A.D. (Oddy, 1981).

This technique is used in many cultures, including Chinese, Japanese and in the West to bond gold to other metals, including [[iron]], [[copper]], [[aluminum]], gold alloys, white gold, [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]. Foil made from gold alloys can be applied to silver and other metals by first [[depletion gilding]] the surface of the foil (Lewton-Brain, 1987–1993).

The term '''Lombard architecture''' refers to the architecture of the Kingdom of the [[Lombards]] in  [[Italy]], which lasted from 568 to 774 (with residual permanence in southern Italy  until the 10th-11th centuries) and which was commissioned by Lombard kings and dukes.

The architectural works of the Lombards in northern Italy ([[Langobardia Major]]) have been mostly lost due to later renovations or reconstructions, the few exceptions including the   Lombard Temple at [[Cividale del Friuli]] or the church of Santa Maria fuori Portas at [[Castelseprio]].  More examples have instead survived in southern Italy ([[Langobardia Minor]]), especially in what was the [[Duchy of Benevento]]: they include the city's walls, the church of [[Santa Sofia, Benevento|Santa Sofia]] and the [[Rocca dei Rettori]], one of the few surviving Lombard military structures, as well as other minor sites near Benevento and in the former [[duchy of Spoleto]].

The main surviving examples of Lombard architecture have been included in the [[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]] site. This consists of seven places with notable architectural, artistic and sculptural, and it is in the [[UNESCO Heritage list]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1318 Longobards in Italy - UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:San salvatore (brescia) interno2.JPG|thumb|250px|Basilica of San Salvatore in [[Brescia]]]]
The most ancient edifices built by the Lombards in Italy, and in particular in their capital, [[Pavia]], have been destroyed or largely renewed in later times. Some trends, which usually ran in different ways from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and Palaeo-Christian architectures predominant in Italy up to late Antiquity, have been identified from archaeological studies or other sources. The destroyed church of Santa Maria in Pertica at Pavia, for example, had a typical Roman plan (octagonal with an [[ambulatory]] delimited by columns) but very high central body was a novelty. The [[Baptistery of San Giovanni ad Fontes]], in [[Lomello]], also departed from the typical Palaeo-Christian compactness in the use of a tall central octagon.&lt;ref name=DeVecchi&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierluigi |last=De Vecchi|author2=Elda Cerchiari |title= I Longobardi in Italia|pages=309–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it had been in Roman times, the commission of lay and religious buildings was used by the Lombard elite to express their prestige and to legitimate their authority.&lt;ref name=Rovagn&gt;{{cite book|first= Sergio |last=Rovagnati|title= I Longobardi|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th and 8th centuries the Lombard architecture evolved in an original direction, with increasing references to Classical art. This trend, characterized by the co-presence of different influences and the adoption of new techniques, culminated in the reign of king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] (712-744), in particular at [[Cividale del Friuli]]. Edifices such as the Lombard Tempietto in the latter city, or the [[Monastery of San Salvatore, Brescia|Monastery of San Salvatore]] at [[Brescia]] show echoes of the contemporary architecture in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=Adorno&gt;{{cite book|first=Piero |last=Adorno|chapter=L'Alto Medioevo|title= L'arte italiana'', Vol. 1, part II |location=Florence|publisher=D'Anna|year= 1992|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period,  the construction of monasteries received a particular impulse, not only as places of adoration or as shows of faith of the commissioners, but also as shelters for the latter's assets and persons and as sites of political control. King [[Desiderius]] (756-774), and with him numerous dukes, gave a particular boost to this trend, which had no direct comparison in the rest of Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=Rovagn/&gt;

The development of Lombard architecture in northern Italy was halted by the conquest of [[Charlemagne]] in 774. In southern Italy, still partly under effective Lombard domination, architecture followed original lines until the conquest by the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in the 11th century. This unity is shown in particular by the most important Lombard edifice in what was Langobardia Minor, the church of [[Santa Sofia (Benevento)|Santa Sofia]] at [[Benevento]]: built in the 8th century, it follows the same pattern of Santa Maria in Pertica with an elevated central body, although mitigated by [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] elements such as the articulations of the volumes and the basic structure itself, perhaps inspired by [[Hagia Sofia]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Adorno/&gt;

When they arrived in Italy in the late 6th century, the Lombards had no architectural tradition of their own. They thus relied on local workforce, taking advantage of the presence of organizations and guilds capable of high level works, which had been kept alive thanks to the relative survival of the urban civilization in Italy after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (differently from most of contemporary Christian western Europe).&lt;ref name=Rovagn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adorno/&gt;

'''Mira Schor''' (born June 1, 1950) is an American artist, writer, editor, and educator, known for her contributions to [[art criticism|critical discourse]] on the status of [[painting]] in [[contemporary art]] and culture as well as to [[feminist art movement|feminist art]] history and criticism.

==Early life and education==
Mira Schor's parents [[Ilya Schor|Ilya]] and [[Resia Schor]] were [[Poles|Polish-born]] artists who came to the US in 1941.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Naomi|date=2010-2011|title=A Mind in a Body in a Landscape.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.pratt.edu:2048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asu&amp;AN=54599486&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Provincetown Arts|volume=25|pages=44–51|via=EBSCO Art &amp; Architecture Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mira Schor and her older sister [[Naomi Schor]] (1943–2001), a noted scholar of [[French literature|French Literature]] and [[Feminist theory]], were both educated at the [[Lycée français de New York|Lycée Français de New York]]. After receiving her [[Baccalauréat]] in 1967, Mira Schor studied [[art history]] at [[New York University]] (WSC&lt;!-- what does this stand for? --&gt; [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] 1970). During this time she worked as an assistant to [[Red Grooms]] and [[Mimi Gross]]. She attended the [[CalArts|California Institute of the Arts (CalArts)]] from 1972-1973, receiving a [[Master of Fine Arts|Master of Fine Arts degree]] in Painting from in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There she was a participant in the CalArts Feminist Art Program’s renowned project [[Womanhouse]] (1972). In the Feminist Art Program she studied with [[Miriam Schapiro|Miriam Shapiro]] and [[Judy Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later at CalArts she studied with [[Los Angeles]]-born sculptor Stephan Von Huene.

==Painting==
Schor’s visual work balances political and theoretical concerns with formalist and material passions. Her work has included major periods in which gendered narrative and representation of the body has been featured, but the predominant focus of her work has been representation of language in [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. Her paintings have been foregrounded by these various disciplines: by painting, with shows such as "Slow Art: Painting in New York Now," at [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]]; by [[feminist art|feminism]], with exhibitions such as "Sexual Politics: [[The Dinner Party|Judy Chicago's 'Dinner Party']] in Feminist Art History," at the [[Hammer Museum|Armand Hammer Museum]]; and by language, with shows such as "Poetry Plastique," at [http://www.marianneboeskygallery.com/ Marianne Boesky Gallery] in New York.

In the 1980s and 90s, Schor's work was also exhibited in New York at the Edward Thorp Gallery, Horodner Romley Gallery, and in group exhibitions including at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art|Santa Monica Museum]], the Armand Hammer Museum, The Neuberger Museum, and the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum|Aldrich Museum]]. Her visual work and her writings are included in ''Art and Feminism'' (2001) and ''Sexual Politics: Judy Chicago’s Dinner Party in Feminist Art History'' (1996). In 2009 Schor exhibited her work at [http://www.momentaart.org Momenta Art] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], in a [[solo exhibition]] entitled "Suddenly," marking a departure in Schor's work, from the depiction of language as image to the suggestion of its lack in a space where we expect to see it. A solo exhibition, [http://www.cb1gallery.com/exhibitions/mira-schor-paintings-from-nineties-to-now.html "Mira Schor: Paintings From the Nineties To Now,"] was held at [http://www.cb1gallery.com CB1 Gallery] in Los Angeles, CA (November 20, 2010 – January 9, 2011) with a [http://www.cb1gallery.com/files/Mira-Schor-brochure.pdf catalogue essay] by art historian [[Amelia Jones]]. Schor exhibited her work at Marvelli Gallery [http://www.marvelligallery.com/Exhibition_MS_VoiceandSpeech_01.html] in 2012. In 2009 painter and critic Robert Berlind wrote, "An intimist whose candor is akin to Emily Dickinson’s.".&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibition Reviews: Mira Schor, Momenta Art," Art in America, June–July, 2009, 199, repro. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 ''New York Times'' review, critic Roberta Smith wrote "Mira Schor’s small, sharp, quirky paintings have been thorns in the side of the medium for more than three decades now" and "Ms. Schor hardly tells the whole story of creative labor, but she lays out its essential elements: the isolation, reading, thinking and percolation that enable a Voice to emerge. At once poetic, lyrical and oddly real, her paintings give rare and sardonic visual form to the life, and the work, of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/arts/design/mira-schor-voice-and-speech.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of Schor's recent exhibitions have been published in [[Art in America]]&lt;ref&gt;Constance Mallinson, Reviews, Mira Schor, ''Art in America'', April 2011, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; and on Artforum.com.

==Writing and Scholarship==

Schor has written frequently on issues of gender representation, including "Backlash and Appropriation," a chapter of ''The Power of Feminist Art'', 1994, an historical overview of the [[feminist art movement|Feminist movement]] published by [[Abrams Books|Abrams]], "Patrilineage", 2002, republished in ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader'' edited by [[Amelia Jones]], and on artists such as [[Ida Applebroog]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], and [[Ana Mendieta]]. Schor is the author of ''Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture'', 1997, and co-founder and co-editor, with [[Susan Bee]], of ''[[M/E/A/N/I/N/G]]: Contemporary Art Issues'' publishing 20 issues from 1986-1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=M/e/a/n/i/n/g: contemporary art issues.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820167747|journal=M/e/a/n/i/n/g : contemporary art issues.|language=English|issn=1040-8576}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online version of the journal, [http://writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/ M/E/A/N/I/NG Online] was launched in 2000 (the final issue, no. 7 was published in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Duke Univ Pr| isbn = 978-0-8223-2566-6| last = Drucker| first = Johanna| others = Susan Bee, Mira Schor (eds.)| title = M/E/A/N/I/N/G: An Anthology of Artists' Writings, Theory, and Criticism| location = Durham, NC| date = 2000-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M/E/A/N/I/N/G'' ''An Anthology of Artists’ Writings, Theory, and Criticism'', was published by Duke University Press in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/491620029|title=M/E/A/N/I/N/G an anthology of artists' writings, theory, and criticism|last=Bee|first=Susan|last2=Schor|first2=Mira|last3=Drucker|first3=Johanna|date=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822325349|location=Durham; London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schor has sometimes been criticized for taking an [[Essentialism|essentialist position]] in terms of feminism and many of her writings take on this debate. In her writings on paintings in essays such as "Figure/Ground," 2001, Schor is seen as making a case for the relevance of painting in a post-medium [[visual culture]] and for arguing for the compatibility and mutuality of painterly and theoretical practices.

In 2003, Schor produced a [[video documentary]] on her parents’ work, ''[[The Tale of the Goldsmith’s Floor]]'', originally created for the 2003 Brown University and ''differences'' conference, "The Lure of the Detail"&lt;ref&gt;"The Tale of The Goldsmith’s Floor," an illustrated video script, appears in ''differences'', Vol. 14, Number 3, Fall 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Schor was awarded the [http://artswriters.org/grantees_2009.html Creative Capital / Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant] to develop [http://ayearofpositivethinking.com/ A Year of Positive Thinking], a blog on contemporary art in 2009.

In 2010 she delivered a lecture called "On Failure and Anonymity" for a collaborative project called ''[[hashtagclass|#class]]'' at Winkleman Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Walter. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/hashtagclass-skin-fruit2-18-10.asp “Art Show as Think Tank”]. Artnet.com. February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

'''''One Thousand and One Nights''''' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة|ʾAlf layla wa-layla}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=3rd|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|year=2007|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of [[Middle East]]ern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

What is common throughout all the editions of the ''Nights'' is the initial [[frame story]] of the ruler [[Shahryār]] and his wife [[Scheherazade]] and the [[framing device]] incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single [[couplet]]s or [[quatrain]]s, although some are longer.

Some of the stories commonly associated with ''The Nights'', in particular "[[Aladdin|Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp]]", "[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]", and "[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]", were not part of ''The Nights'' in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by [[Antoine Galland]] and other European translators.&lt;ref&gt;John Payne, ''Alaeddin and the Enchanted Lamp and Other Stories'', (London 1901) gives details of Galland's encounter with 'Hanna' in 1709 and of the discovery in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris of two Arabic manuscripts containing Aladdin and two more of the added tales.

The main [[frame story]] concerns Shahryār  ({{lang-ar|شهريار}}, from [[Middle Persian]] ''šahr-dār'', lit. "holder of realm"&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ch. Pellat|title=Alf Layla Wa Layla|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla|year=2011|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whom the narrator calls a "[[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king" ruling in "India and China".&lt;ref&gt;''The Arabian Nights'', translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons (Penguin Classics, 2008), vol. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonour him. Eventually the [[vizier]], whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. [[Scheherazade]] ({{lang-ar|شهرزاد}}, from Middle Persian ''čehr'', "lineage" + ''āzād'', "noble"&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt;&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Hamori, A. |title=S̲h̲ahrazād| year= 2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6771}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.

The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s, and various forms of [[erotica]]. Numerous stories depict [[jinn]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[ape]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-3sindbad.htm The Third Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman – The Arabian Nights – The Thousand and One Nights – Sir Richard Burton translator].

Common [[protagonist]]s include the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]], in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.

[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|left|180px|An Abbasid [[manuscript]] of the ''One Thousand and One Nights'']]
The different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.

The narrator's standards for what constitutes a [[cliffhanger]] seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of [[Islamic philosophy]], and in one case during a detailed description of [[Medicine in medieval Islam#Human anatomy and physiology|human anatomy]] according to [[Galen]]—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.

==History: versions and translations==
The history of the ''Nights'' is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] summarises their findings:

{{quote|In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the ''Nights'' by [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from [[India]] and [[Persia]]. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title ''Alf Layla'', or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among them some tales about the [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Possible Indian influence===
Devices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.271"&gt;Reynolds p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Indian folklore is represented in the ''Nights'' by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit fables]]. The influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' is particularly notable.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard F. (2002). ''Vikram and the Vampire Or Tales of Hindu Devilry'' p. xi. Adamant Media Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jataka tales|The Jataka Tales]]'' are a collection of 547 [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist stories]], which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. ''The Tale of the Bull and the Ass'' and the linked ''Tale of the Merchant and his Wife'' are found in the frame stories of both the ''Jataka'' and the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the ''Tantropakhyana''. Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of this work exist, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil,&lt;ref&gt;Artola. ''Pancatantra'' Manuscripts from South India in the ''Adyar Library Bulletin''. 1957. pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Lao,&lt;ref&gt;K. Raksamani.

Paris. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Javanese.&lt;ref&gt;C. Hooykaas. Bibliotheca Javaneca No. 2. Bandoeng. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The frame story is particularly interesting, as it follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the ''Panchatantra''—with its original Indian setting.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Warder. ''Indian Kāvya Literature: The art of storytelling, Volume VI''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers. 1992. pp. 61–62, 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Panchatantra'' and various tales from ''Jatakas'' were first translated into Persian by [[Borzūya]] in 570 CE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=106622 IIS.ac.uk Dr Fahmida Suleman, "Kalila wa Dimna"], in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization, An Encyclopaedia'', Vol. II, pp. 432–33, ed. Josef W. Meri, New York-London: Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; they were later translated into Arabic by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa'|Ibn al-Muqaffa]] in 750 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fables of Kalila and Dimnah'', translated from the Arabic by Saleh Sa'adeh Jallad, 2002. Melisende, London, {{ISBN|1-901764-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Kalilah and Dimnah; or, The fables of Bidpai; being an account of their literary history, [https://archive.org/stream/kalilahdimnahorf00bdpkuoft#page/n19/mode/2up p. xiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian prototype: ''Hezār Afsān''===
[[File:Kelileh va Demneh.jpg|thumb|right|A page from Kelileh va Demneh dated 1429, from Herat, a Persian version of the Panchatantra – depicts the manipulative jackal-vizier, Dimna, trying to lead his lion-king into war.]]
The earliest mentions of the ''Nights'' refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, ''Hezār Afsān'' (or ''Afsaneh'' or ''Afsana''), meaning "The Thousand Stories". In the 10th century [[Ibn al-Nadim]] compiled a catalogue of books (the "Fihrist") in Baghdad. He noted that the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] kings of Iran enjoyed "evening tales and fables".&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian ''Hezār Afsān'', explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night; finally one concubine had the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king would delay her execution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection's literary quality, observing that "it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century [[Al-Masudi]] also refers to the ''Hezār Afsān'', saying the Arabic translation is called ''Alf Khurafa'' ("A Thousand Entertaining Tales") but is generally known as ''Alf Layla'' ("A Thousand Nights"). He mentions the characters Shirāzd (Scheherazade) and Dināzād.&lt;ref name="Irwin p.49"&gt;Irwin p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

No physical evidence of the ''Hezār Afsān'' has survived,&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.271"/&gt; so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51: "It seems probable from all the above [...] that the Persian ''Hezār Afsaneh'' was translated into Arabic in the eighth or early 9th century and was given the title ''Alf Khurafa'' before being subsequently retitled ''Alf Layla''. However, it remains far from clear what the connection is between this fragment of the early text and the ''Nights'' stories as they have survived in later and fuller manuscripts; nor how the Syrian manuscripts related to later Egyptian versions."&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Sallis ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 2 and note 6&lt;/ref&gt; These stories include the cycle of "King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas" and "The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son" (derived from the 7th-century Persian ''Bakhtiyārnāma'').&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] scholar [[Safa Khulusi]] suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] may have been responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, ''Studies in Comparative Literature and Western Literary Schools,'' Chapter: ''Qisas Alf Laylah wa Laylah'' (''One thousand and one Nights''), pp. 15–85. Al-Rabita Press, Baghdad, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, The Influence of Ibn al-Muqaffa' on The Arabian Nights. ''Islamic Review'', Dec 1960, pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, the scholar [[Nabia Abbott]] found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title ''The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights'', dating from the 9th century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' appears in Cairo in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Irwin p.50"&gt;Irwin p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:

{{quote|Some of the earlier Persian tales may have survived within the Arabic tradition altered such that Arabic Muslim names and new locations were substituted for pre-Islamic Persian ones, but it is also clear that whole cycles of Arabic tales were eventually added to the collection and apparently replaced most of the Persian materials. One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century Baghdad, including the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (died 809), his vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]] (d. 803) and the licentious poet [[Abu Nuwas]] (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.270"&gt;Reynolds p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition includes the oldest manuscripts; these versions are also much shorter and include fewer tales. It is represented in print by the so-called ''Calcutta I'' (1814–1818) and most notably by the ''Leiden edition'' (1984), which is based above all on the ''[[Antoine Galland|Galland]] manuscript''. It is believed to be the purest expression of the style of the mediaeval ''Arabian Nights''.&lt;ref name=beaustyle&gt;Beaumont, Daniel. Literary Style and Narrative Technique in the Arabian Nights. p. 1. In The Arabian nights encyclopedia, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irwstyle&gt;Irwin, Robert. 2004. The Arabian nights: a companion. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written,&lt;ref name=sallis/&gt;&lt;!--p.32--&gt; and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps in order to attain the eponymous number of 1001 nights. The final product of this tradition, the so-called [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] Egyptian [[Recension]], does contain 1001 nights and is reflected in print, with slight variations, by the editions known as the ''Bulaq'' (1835) and the ''Macnaghten'' or ''Calcutta II'' (1839–1842).

All extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=John|title=The Book Of Thousand Nights And One Night Vol-ix|date=1901|location=London|pages=289|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.172872|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more "authentic" and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as [[Muhsin Mahdi]] have suspected that this may have been caused in part by European demand for a "complete version"; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.&lt;ref name=sallis&gt;[[Eva Sallis|Sallis, Eva]]. 1999.

===Modern translations===
{{main|Translations of One Thousand and One Nights}}
[[File:William-Strang-Sindbad-AliBaba-titlepage.JPG|thumb|''Sinbad the sailor and Ali Baba and the forty thieves'' by [[William Strang]], 1896]]
The first European version (1704–1717) was translated into [[French language|French]] by [[Antoine Galland]] from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, ''[[Les mille et une nuits|Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français]]'' ("The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French"), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. "Aladdin's Lamp", and "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from a [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] [[Christian]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], a [[Maronite]] scholar whom he called "Hanna Diab." Galland's version of the ''Nights'' was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.

As scholars were looking for the presumed "complete" and "original" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the "standard version". The first translations of this kind, such as that of [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were [[bowdlerized]]. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882, nine volumes), and then by [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], entitled ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885, ten volumes)&amp;nbsp;– the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=sallis2/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. The Arabian nights encyclopedia, Volume 1. pp. 506–08&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;) and the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'', which were printed between 1886 and 1888.  It has, however, been criticized for its "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on sexuality" (and has even been called an "eccentric [[wiktionary:ego-trip|ego-trip]]" and a "highly personal reworking of the text").&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;

Later versions of the ''Nights'' include that of the [[French people|French]] doctor [[J. C. Mardrus]], issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by [[Powys Mathers]], and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.&lt;ref name=sallis2&gt;Sallis, Eva. 1999. Sheherazade through the looking glass: the metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights. pp. 4 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable recent version, which reverts to the [[Syria]]n recension, is a critical edition based on the 14th- or 15th-century [[Syria]]n manuscript in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], originally used by Galland. This version, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by [[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1984) and rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a "definitive" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the [[Mamluk]] period (a view that remains contentious).&lt;ref name=sallis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Dobie, 2009.

The Arabian nights: a companion. pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of "the only ''real'' Arabian Nights" recognize it as being the best source on the original ''style'' and linguistic form of the mediaeval work&lt;ref name=beaustyle/&gt;&lt;ref name=irwstyle/&gt; and praise the Haddawy translation as "very readable" and "strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic flavour of those tales".&lt;ref name=irw/&gt; An additional second volume of ''Arabian nights'' translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales ''not'' present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995.

In 2008 a new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in three volumes. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton's. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called "orphan stories" of ''[[Aladdin]]'' and ''[[Ali Baba]]'' as well as an alternative ending to ''The seventh journey of [[Sindbad]]'' from [[Antoine Galland]]'s original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, "[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text," and the work is a "representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pen.org/blog/?p=4056 PEN American Center]. Pen.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation.

==Literary themes and techniques==
[[File:Thousand_and_One_Nights_21.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' by [[Sani ol Molk]], Iran, 1853]]

The ''One Thousand and One Nights'' and various tales within it make use of many innovative [[literary technique]]s, which the storytellers of the tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions.&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt; Some of these date back to earlier [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Indian literature|Indian]] and [[Arabic literature]], while others were original to the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.

===Frame story===
An early example of the [[frame story]], or [[framing device]], is employed in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', in which the character [[Scheherazade]] narrates a set of tales (most often [[fairy tale]]s) to the Sultan [[Shahrayar|Shahriyar]] over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales are also frame stories, such as the ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman]]'' being a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

===Embedded narrative===
An early example of the "[[story within a story]]" technique can be found in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' of ancient [[Sanskrit literature]]. The ''Nights'', however, improved on the ''Panchatantra'' in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the ''Panchatantra'', stories are introduced as [[Didacticism|didactic]] analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase "If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you." In the ''Nights'', this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Within the "Sinbad the Sailor" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as "[[The Three Apples]]" and "[[#Unreliable narrator|The Seven Viziers]]". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, "[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]", the "Tale of the Wazir and the Sage [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Duban|Duban]]" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.

===Dramatic visualization===
Dramatic visualization is "the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience". This technique dates back to the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360/&gt; An example of this is the tale of "The Three Apples" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

===Fate and destiny===
A common [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in many ''Arabian Nights'' tales is [[wiktionary:fate|fate]] and [[destiny]]. The [[Italian people|Italian]] filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|every tale in ''The Thousand and One Nights'' begins with an 'appearance of destiny' which manifests itself through an anomaly, and one anomaly always generates another. So a chain of anomalies is set up. And the more logical, tightly knit, essential this chain is, the more beautiful the tale. By 'beautiful' I mean vital, absorbing and exhilarating. The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to normality. The end of every tale in ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' consists of a 'disappearance' of destiny, which sinks back to the [[somnolence]] of daily life ... The protagonist of the stories is in fact destiny itself.}}

Though invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot devices often used to present this theme are [[coincidence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Retrocausality|reverse causation]] and the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] below). {{Clear}}

===Foreshadowing===
[[File:The Valley of Diamonds by Maxfield Parrish.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sinbad|Sindbad]] and the Valley of Diamonds, from the Second Voyage.]]

Early examples of the [[foreshadowing]] technique of [[repetitive designation]], now known as "[[Chekhov's gun]]", occur in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which contains "repeated references to some character or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [359]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is in the tale of "The Three Apples" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

Another early foreshadowing technique is ''formal patterning'', "the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds". This technique is also found in ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360/&gt;

Another form of foreshadowing is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], which dates back to the story of [[Krishna]] in ancient [[Sanskrit literature]], and [[Oedipus]] or the death of [[Heracles]] in the plays of [[Sophocles]]. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in [[Arabic literature]] (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Bible]]). Several tales in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Foreshadowing|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]" and [[Paulo Coelho]]'s "[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]"; [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' collection of short stories ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]'' featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as "The Story Of The Two Dreamers."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "The Tale of Attaf", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]'' [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'afar, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the tale, Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he didn't commit but Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''[[Disciplina Clericalis]]'',&lt;ref name=Marzolph-109&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the "[[Seven Wise Masters|Sindibad]]" story cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, a version of "The Tale of Attaf" also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref name=Marzolph-109/&gt;

===Repetition===
[[File:One_Thousand_and_One_Nights26.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' by [[Sani ol molk]], Iran, 1849–1856]]

''[[Leitwortstil]]'' is 'the purposeful [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]] of words' in a given literary piece that "usually expresses a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] or [[Theme (literature)|theme]] important to the given story". This device occurs in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which binds several tales in a story cycle. The storytellers of the tales relied on this technique "to shape the constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole."&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thematic patterning]] is "the distribution of recurrent [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] concepts and moralistic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] among the various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in common". This technique also dates back to the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' (and earlier).&lt;ref name=Heath-360&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [360]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different variants of the "[[Cinderella]]" story, which has its origins in the Egyptian story of [[Rhodopis]], appear in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', including "The Second Shaykh's Story", "The Eldest Lady's Tale" and "Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, "Judar and His Brethren", departs from the [[happy ending]]s of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a [[Tragedy|tragic]] ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual humour===
The ''Nights'' contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this borders on [[satire]], as in the tale called "Ali with the Large Member" which pokes fun at obsession with [[human penis size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ali with the Large Member" is only in the [[Wortley Montague manuscript]] (1764), which is in the [[Bodleian Library]], and is not found in Burton or any of the other standard translations. (Ref: ''Arabian Nights Encyclopedia'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable narrator===
The literary device of the [[unreliable narrator]] was used in several fictional medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic tales]] of the ''One Thousand and One Nights''. In one tale, "The Seven Viziers" (also known as "Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs"), a [[courtesan]] accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the [[Qur'an]]ic/[[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]]/[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]). Seven [[vizier]]s attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds back by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate [[suspense]] in "The Three Apples" and [[humor]] in "The Hunchback's Tale" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

===Crime fiction elements===
[[File:Godefroy Durand - Morgiane.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicting [[Morgiana]] and the thieves from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]''.]]
An example of the [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thriller]] genres in the collection, with multiple [[plot twist]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[detective fiction]] elements&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=91, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "[[The Three Apples]]", also known as ''Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula'' ("The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman"),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.
In this tale, [[Harun al-Rashid]] comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]], three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.
Harun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan.  Thus the mystery is solved.

Another ''Nights'' tale with [[crime fiction]] elements was "The Hunchback's Tale" story cycle which, unlike "The Three Apples", was more of a [[suspense]]ful [[comedy]] and [[Legal drama|courtroom drama]] rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite [[comedian]], being invited to dinner by a [[tailor]] couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Jewish doctor]]'s [[Bimaristan|clinic]] and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the "Tale of the Jewish Doctor", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a [[courtroom]], all making [[Unreliable narrator|different claims]] over how the hunchback had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of "The Tale of Attaf" (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] above).

===Horror fiction elements===
[[Haunting]] is used as a [[plot device]] in [[gothic fiction]] and [[horror fiction]], as well as modern [[paranormal fiction]]. Legends about [[haunted house]]s have long appeared in literature. In particular, the ''Arabian Nights'' tale of "Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad" revolves around a house haunted by [[Genie|jinns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East &amp; West|last=Yuriko Yamanaka|first=Tetsuo Nishio|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|year=2006|isbn=1-85043-768-8|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nights'' is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions [[ghoul]]s, and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story ''The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib'' (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib''|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221142538/http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-date=December 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horror fiction elements are also found in "The City of Brass" tale, which revolves around a [[ghost town]].&lt;ref name=Hamori&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [10]}} The hero of the tale is an historical person, [[Musa bin Nusayr]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The horrific nature of [[Scheherazade]]'s situation is magnified in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the ''Nights'' on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. As a child, he was fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he attributes some of his creations to his love of the ''1001 Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Necronomicon Files: The Truth Behind Lovecraft's Legend|first=John Wisdom Gonce, John Wisdom Gonce, III|last=Daniel Harms|publisher=Weiser|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57863-269-5|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===

There is an abundance of [[Arabic poetry]] in ''One Thousand and One Nights''. Characters occasionally provide poetry in certain settings, covering many uses. However, pleading, beseeching and praising the powerful is the most significant.

The uses would include but are not limited to:
* Giving advice, warning, and solutions.
* Praising God, royalties and those in power.
* Pleading for mercy and forgiveness.
* Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck.
* Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges.
* Criticizing elements of life, wondering.
* Expressing feelings to others or one's self: happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise, anger.

In a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/1001nights/burton/kamar.htm Burton Nights].

The influence of the versions of ''The Nights'' on world literature is immense. Writers as diverse as [[Henry Fielding]] to [[Naguib Mahfouz]] have alluded to the collection by name in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the ''Nights'' include [[John Barth]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Walter Scott]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Wilkie Collins]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[Charles Nodier|Nodier]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Marcel Schwob]], [[Stendhal]], [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Arthur de Gobineau|Gobineau]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]], [[William Butler Yeats|W.

Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]]. Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further "long ago" or farther "far away"; this process culminates in the [[fantasy world]] having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from [[Arabian mythology]] are now common in modern [[fantasy]], such as [[genie]]s, [[bahamut]]s, [[magic carpet]]s, magic lamps, etc. When [[L. Frank Baum]] proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.&lt;ref&gt;James Thurber, "The Wizard of Chitenango", p. 64 ''Fantasists on Fantasy'' edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, {{ISBN|0-380-86553-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Arab culture===
There is little evidence that the ''Nights'' was particularly treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as ''khurafa'' (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children). According to Robert Irwin, "Even today, with the exception of certain writers and academics, the ''Nights'' is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ''Nights'' have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] (author of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] play ''Shahrazad'', 1934), [[Taha Hussein]] (''Scheherazade's Dreams'', 1943)&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'', 1981).

===Possible early influence on European literature===
Although the first known translation into a European language only appeared in 1704, it is possible that the ''Nights'' began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]]'s story collection ''[[El Conde Lucanor]]'' and [[Ramón Llull]]'s ''The Book of Beasts''.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 92–94&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the ''Nights'' are found in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (in ''[[The Squire's Tale]]'' the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Echoes in [[Giovanni Sercambi]]'s ''Novelle'' and [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 96–99&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the [[Balkans]] and a translation of the ''Nights'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western literature from the 18th century onwards===
[[File:CC No 08 Arabian Nights.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Classic Comics]]'' issue #8]]

The modern fame of the ''Nights'' derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], Galland "played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the ''Nights''."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for ''contes de fées'' ("fairy stories"). This fashion began with the publication of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]'s ''Histoire d'Hypolite'' in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the ''Nights'', with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the ''Nights'' spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds pp. 279–81&lt;/ref&gt; Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include [[Antoine Hamilton|Anthony Hamilton]]'s ''Les quatre Facardins'' (1730), [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon|Crébillon]]'s ''[[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|Le sopha]]'' (1742) and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels|Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 238–41&lt;/ref&gt; The English versions of the "Oriental Tale" generally contained a heavy moralising element,&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p.242&lt;/ref&gt; with the notable exception of [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s fantasy ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the [[Gothic novel]]. The Polish nobleman [[Jan Potocki]]'s novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the ''Nights'' with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 245–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] (when an apprentice) to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725. Andrew Millar Project. University of Edinburgh.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nights'' continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to [[A. S. Byatt]], "In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational."&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (Harvard University Press, 2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In their autobiographical writings, both [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Thomas de Quincey|de Quincey]] refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth in Book Five of ''[[The Prelude]]''; Tennyson in his poem "Recollections of the ''Arabian Nights''". (Irwin, pp. 266–69)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the ''Nights'' pervades the opening of his last novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,&lt;ref name="Byatt p.168"&gt;Byatt p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Théophile Gautier]] (''La mille deuxième nuit'', 1842)&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica"/&gt; and [[Joseph Roth]] (''Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht'', 1939).&lt;ref name="Byatt p.168"/&gt; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote  "[[The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade]]" (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.

Another important literary figure, the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[W. B. Yeats]] was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, [[A Vision]] an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of [[Harun Al-Rashid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/readingeurope/content/ire/NatLibIre_01.pdf|title=The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems by William Butler Yeats|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to his joint experiments with his wife [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], with [[Automatic writing]]. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as "a gift" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Qusta Ibn Luqa]], who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=y5GuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dLo_n9bRYO&amp;sig=OToXfH6YbmgQJu_iRanmQ3ROub4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2ZnxhOPSAhUCzRQKHQrbAuQQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&amp;f=false|title=In Excited Reverie: Centenary Tribute to W.B.

[[Image:Kosuth OneAndThreeChairs.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Kosuth]], ''One and Three Chairs'' (1965)]]

'''''One and Three Chairs''''', 1965, is a work by [[Joseph Kosuth]]. An example of [[conceptual art]], the piece consists of a [[chair]], a photograph of the chair, and an enlarged dictionary definition of the word "chair". The photograph depicts the chair as it is actually installed in the room, and thus the work changes each time it is installed in a new venue.

Two elements of the work remain constant: a copy of a dictionary definition of the word "chair" and a diagram with instructions for installation. Both bear Kosuth's signature. Under the instructions, the installer is to choose a chair, place it before a wall, and take a photograph of the chair. This photo is to be enlarged to the size of the actual chair and placed on the wall to the left of the chair. Finally, a blow-up of the copy of the dictionary definition is to be hung to the right of the chair, its upper edge aligned with that of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Dickel, Hans u.a.: Die Sammlung Paul Maenz. Neues Museum Weimar. Edition Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 1998, p. 82s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early conceptual art==

"Event cards" of [[Fluxus]]-artists like [[George Brecht]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Yoko Ono]] prefigured Kosuth's concern with the difference between a concept and its mode of presentation. These artists also tackled the problem of presenting "concepts" to an art audience. ''One and Three Chairs'' is, perhaps, a step towards a resolution of this problem. Rather than present the viewer with the bare written instructions for the work, or make a live event of the realization of the concept (in the manner of the Fluxus artists), Kosuth instead unifies concept and realization. ''One and Three Chairs'' demonstrates how an artwork can embody an idea that remains constant despite changes to its elements. 

Kosuth stresses the difference between concept and presentation in his writings (e.g., "Art after Philosophy", 1969&lt;ref name="Kosuth1"&gt;Kosuth J., (1969), [http://www.ubu.com/papers/kosuth_philosophy.html ''Art after Philosophy, part 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;
) and interviews (see the quotation below). He tries to intimately bind the conceptual nature of his work with the nature of art itself, thus raising his instructions for the presentation of an artwork to the level of a discourse on art. In 1963 [[Henry Flynt]] articulated these problems in the article "Concept Art".&lt;ref&gt;Flynt, Henry: [http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html ''Concept Art'']. In: Mac Low, Jackson/Young: LaMonte (ed.): An Anthology. New York 1963, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a forerunner to Kosuth's thematization of "Concept Art" in "Art after Philosophy", the text that made ''One and Three Chairs'' famous.&lt;ref&gt;Kosuth, Joseph: Art after Philosophy, Part III. In: Studio International, November 1969, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The work ''One and Three Chairs'' can be seen to highlight the relation between language, picture and referent. It problematizes relations between object, visual and verbal references ([[denotation (semiotics)|denotations]]) plus semantic fields of the term chosen for the verbal reference. The term of the dictionary includes [[connotation (semiotics)|connotations]] and possible denotations which are  relevant in the context of the presentation of ''One and Three Chairs''. The meanings of the three elements are congruent in certain semantic fields and incongruent in other semantic fields: A semantic congruity ("One") and a threefold incongruity ("One and Three").  Ironically,  ''One and Three Chairs'' can be looked upon as simple but rather complex model, of the science of signs. A viewer may ask "what's real here?" and answer that "the definition is real"; Without a definition, one would never know what an actual chair is.

There exist different interpretations of these semantic and ontological aspects. Some refer to [[Plato]]´s ''Republic'' (Book X);&lt;ref&gt;Gerwen, Rob van: Introducing My Philosophical Directions: [http://www.phil.uu.nl/~rob/directions/cave.shtml Plato´s Cave]. Universiteit Utrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; others refer to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]´s ''Tractatus''&lt;ref&gt;Inboden, Gudrun: Introduction: Joseph Kosuth - Artist and Critic of Modernism. In: Joseph Kosuth: The Making of Meaning. Selected Writings and Documentation of Investigations on Art Since 1965. Cat. of exhib. Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Stuttgart 1981, p. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s triad icon-index-symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Tragatschnig, Ulrich: Konzeptuelle Kunst. Interpretationsparadigmen: Ein Propädeutikum. Reimer, Berlin 1998, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreher discusses the semantic problems of ''One and Three Chairs'' as inclusions of circles which represent semantic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Dreher, Thomas: Konzeptuelle Kunst in Amerika und England zwischen 1963 und 1976. Thesis Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität/Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main 1992, p. 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work tends to defy formal analysis because one chair can be substituted for another chair, rendering the photograph and the chair photographed elusive to description. Nevertheless the particular chair and its accompanying photograph lend themselves to formal analysis. There are many chairs in the world; thus only those actually used can be described. Those chairs not used would not be analyzed. The enlarged dictionary definition of the word chair is also open to formal analysis, as is the diagram containing instructions of the work.

==The concept and the theory of art==
Kosuth's thematization of semantic congruities and incongruities can be seen as a reflection of the problems which the relations between concept and presentation pose. Kosuth uses the related questions, "how meanings of signs are constituted" and "how signs refer to extra-lingual phenomena" as a fundament to discuss the relation between concept and presentation. Kosuth tries to identify or equate these philosophical problems with the theory of art. Kosuth changes the art practice from hand-made originals to notations with substitutable realizations, and tries to exemplify the relevance of this change for the theory of art. 

In "Art after Philosophy," Kosuth provoked a confrontation with the formal criticism of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]]. Both exposed the concept of the art work as a non-substitutable instance realized by an artist who follows no other criteria than visual ones. They defined this concept as the core of modernism. In the sixties, Greenberg's and Fried's modernist doctrine dominated the American discussions on art; meanwhile, the artists [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]], Henry Flynt, [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Smithson]] and Joseph Kosuth wrote articles on art exemplifying a pluralistic anti- and post-modernist tendency which gained more influence at the end of the sixties. In 1968, Greenberg tried to disqualify the new tendencies as "'novelty' art": "The different mediums are exploding...when everybody is a revolutionary the revolution is over."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement: [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/avantgarde.html Avant Garde Attitudes], 1968. The Jon Power Lecture in Contemporary Art, 17 Mai 1968. First published in: In Memory of John Joseph Wardell Power. Power Institute of Fine Arts, University of Sydney, 1969. Republished in: Greenberg, Clement: The Collected Essays and Criticism. volume 4: Modernism with a Vengeance, 1957-1969. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1993, p. 292, 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Hunter]] offered a more positive view in 1972: "The situation of open possibilities which confronted artists in the first years of the seventies allowed a variety of means and many fertile idea systems to coexist, reconciling through the poetic imagination apparent contradictions." &lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Sam: American Art of the 20th Century. New York 1972, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotation==
Joseph Kosuth, WBAI, April 7, 1970:

:"I used common, functional objects - such as a chair - and to the left of the object would be a full-scale photograph of it and to the right of the object would be a photostat of a definition of the object from the dictionary. Everything you saw when you looked at the object had to be the same that you saw in the photograph, so each time the work was exhibited the new installation necessitated a new photograph. I liked that the work itself was something other than simply what you saw. By changing the location, the object, the photograph and still having it remain the same work was ''very'' interesting. It meant you could have an art work which was that ''idea'' of an art work, and its formal components weren't important." &lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeanne: Artwords. Discourse on the 60s and 20s. UMI Research Press, Ann Arbour/Michigan 1985; second edition Da Capo Press, New York 1992, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work on Kant, Guyer has published on many other figures in the history of philosophy, including [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], and others. Guyer's ''Kant and The Claims of Knowledge'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]) is widely considered to be one of the most significant works in Kant scholarship. Recent works by Guyer include ''Knowledge, Reason, and Taste: Kant's Response to Hume'' ([[Princeton University Press]]), and ''The Cambridge Companion to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]).

His other areas of specialty include the history of philosophy and aesthetics.  His three-volume work ''A History of Modern Aesthetics'' was published by Cambridge University Press in February 2014.&lt;ref name="Guyer's UPenn page"&gt;[http://www.phil.upenn.edu/faculty/guyer/ Guyer's university page]&lt;/ref&gt; Guyer was President of the American Society for Aesthetics in 2011–13.&lt;ref name="UPenn announcement"&gt;[http://www.phil.upenn.edu/node/68366 Official UPenn announcement of Guyer's appointment]&lt;/ref&gt; Guyer was also President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in 2011-12.

These winners were not required to paint scenes from Asia, which they had usually not visited prior to winning the prize. For example, [[Henri Dabadie]], having travelled at his own expenses in Algeria, without having won the coveted Prix Abd-el-Tif for a residence at the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], entered a painting of the Bay of Tunis into competition at the Salon de la Société coloniale des Artistes français in 1928, which won him the Prix de l'Indochine, including free passage to Indochina, and a period of employment at EBAI in Hanoi.&lt;ref name=Indochine&gt;André-Pallois, Nadine.

'''Roden Crater''' is a [[cinder cone]] type of [[volcanic cone]] from an extinct [[volcano]], with a remaining interior [[volcanic crater]]. It is located northeast of the city of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in northern [[Arizona]], United States.

==Art project==
The artist [[James Turrell]], for his [[land art]] project, acquired the 400,000-year-old,  {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=mid|-wide}} crater's land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasersol.com/art/turrell/roden_crater.html ''Roden Crater project info''&lt;/ref&gt; Turrell has since been transforming the inner cone of the crater into a massive naked-eye observatory, designed specifically for viewing and experiencing  sky-light, solar, and celestial phenomena. The fleeting winter and summer [[solstice]] events will be highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jullia. "Occluded Front, James Turrell".

It is based in [[Cardiff]], with four branches throughout Wales; Design Circle (RSAW South), Mid Wales Branch, [[North Wales Society of Architects]] and West Wales Branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Royal Society of Architects in Wales|url=http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/RSAW.aspx|work=RIBA|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Society represented around 800 [[architects]] in Wales.&lt;ref name="AJ 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=RSAW have appointed|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/rsaw-have-appointed/149513.article|work=Architects' Journal|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSAW regularly organises competitions to highlight good architecture in Wales. In 2012 it held a competition entitled ''ReDesigning the Terrace'', with the 12 shortlisted entries displayed at its conference in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cate St Hill, [http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/shortlist-revealed-for-rsaw-welsh-terrace-competition/5047331.article "Shortlist revealed for RSAW Welsh Terrace competition"], ''[[Building Design]]'', 12 December 2012.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|film|date=September 2017}}
In 1964 [[Acapulco]], Frank Forbes, Levar Mathis, and Nadine Henly are anxiously pushing their employer, Howard Hughes, to phone in to a press conference.

In 1958 [[Los Angeles]], Frank picks up Marla Mabrey, a devout [[Baptists|Baptist]] beauty queen, alongside her strict mother Lucy. Marla is under contract with Hughes' [[RKO Pictures]], receiving $400 a week (${{Inflation|US|400|1958|r=-1|fmt=c}} today) and living in a beautiful home. Frank becomes Marla's main driver, chauffeuring her to the singing and dancing classes set up for Hughes' current retinue of 26 contract starlets.

Marla patiently waits for her screen test for ''Stella Starlight'', but delays frustrate Marla and her mother, compounded by the fact that they have yet to meet Hughes. Marla befriends fellow RKO starlet Mamie. Levar regularly reminds Frank that the starlets cannot have boyfriends, and the chauffeurs must avoid any friendships with the girls. Frank is also devoutly religious, though he and his fiancée Sarah have secretly had sex, which they believe makes them effectively married already. When Lucy decides that they should return to [[Virginia]], Marla opts to continue waiting for her screen test.

With her mother gone, Frank and Marla develop a deep connection. He lets her drive the car, and even tells her the full detail of his relationship with Sarah when Marla confides her virginity. Marla eventually shares that her worries over conforming to the Hollywood "rules" of being a great singer, dancer, or having a big bosom. Frank tells her that the rules do not apply to her. Marla finally meets Hughes in a private bungalow, where she turns down his offer of a drink and talks frankly about her aspirations to act. Nadine, Hughes' executive secretary, sets up Marla's screen test. Frank also meets Hughes for the first time, during which Hughes takes an immediate liking to him and brings Frank into his inner circle of staff.

Hughes becomes very reclusive, worried that the minority shareholders at [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA), who openly disagree with how he runs the company, will try to have him committed so that they can control the company. His right-hand-man [[Noah Dietrich]] upsets Hughes by suggesting he see a psychiatrist, and Hughes gets legal advice that he should get married so his "wife" can refuse to sign any commitment papers. Marla's screen test is a meaningless façade. Later, she sings Frank a song she wrote for him, leading to them sharing a passionate kiss. They quickly stop themselves; Marla tells him that she feels like an adulterer, but Frank says that he will break up with Sarah.

While Frank is gone, Marla is called to another late night meeting with Hughes. She is very upset about Frank and consumes alcohol for the first time. When Hughes finally joins her, a very drunk Marla tells him how special he is. She performs her song for Hughes, who becomes emotional and suddenly proposes marriage, resulting in them having sex. The next day, Frank is devastated when she reveals that she is engaged to someone (she doesn't say who) and rudely dismisses him.

Within days, Hughes marries [[Jean Peters]] to protect him from being committed, fires Noah and hires Robert Maheu to be the CEO of his companies. Maheu warns him that the TWA shareholders could force Hughes to physically appear in court on charges of mismanaging TWA.

Marla is upset with herself for believing Hughes' proposal and having sex with him. When she later informs Hughes that she is pregnant with his child, he reacts by suggesting she is lying and looking for money. She is again very dismissive and rude to Frank, then returns to Virginia.

Hughes takes his entourage out of the U.S., becoming more and more reclusive.  When the U.S. courts decide in favor of the minority TWA shareholders, with a judgement for $645 million, Hughes has to sell his most cherished asset, his father's original [[Hughes Tool Company]], to pay off the debt.

The story then jumps forward to 1964, with Frank, Levar, and Nadine waiting for Hughes to make his call to the U.S. press. It concerns a book written by Miskin, Mamie's ex-boyfriend, who claims to have interviewed Hughes in person and that Hughes has complete dementia, which could cost him the rest of his empire. Marla suddenly arrives with Matt, her and Hughes' five-year-old, with news that Mamie is ready to confirm in court that Miskin never met Hughes &amp;ndash; so Hughes does not need to take the call.  When he learns that Matt is there, he finds the strength to make the phone call. Hughes talks in great detail about many current and past events &amp;ndash; proving he is lucid &amp;ndash; then confirms that he has never met Miskin.

Frank immediately quits his job, goes after Marla and Matt, and the three leave together to live as a family in Los Angeles.

Todd McCarthy of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote "At once an amusingly eccentric take on a billionaire fixated with controlling other people's lives and a romance about a young couple constipated by the conservative religious and social sexual mores of the 1950s, this is a fitfully funny quasi-farce that takes off promisingly, loses its way mid-flight and comes in for a bumpy but safe landing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rules-dont-apply-review-946080|title='Rules Don't Apply': Film Review – AFI Fest|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Variety'' critic Peter Debruge wrote "Warren Beatty certainly took his time in getting this sprawling [[Spruce Goose]] of a movie off the ground, as the romance distracts from the Howard Hughes portrait, or vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/rules-dont-apply-review-warren-beatty-1201914442/|title=AFI Film Review: 'Rules Don't Apply'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is great, there is some snappy dialogue and some nicely drawn characters and the cast can't be faulted [...] but unlike directors such as the [[Coen brothers]], Beatty fails to make it pop and, in most cases, criminally underutilizes them – this does both them and the film a disservice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/rules-dont-apply-review|title=Rules Don't Apply Review|website=[[IGN]]|first=Simon|last=Thompson|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Palmer of ''The Reel Deal'' gave the film a rating of 3/10, writing, "As someone who appreciates Warren Beatty's place and contribution to Hollywood history, I hope and pray he appears in at least one more great film, because ending his career on something as poorly assembled and downright boring as ''Rules Don't Apply'' would be devastating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thereeldealsite.wordpress.com/2016/11/24/rules-dont-apply-a-boring-disappointing-return-for-warren-beatty/ |title='Rules Don’t Apply' a Boring, Disappointing Return for Warren Beatty|website=The Reel Deal|first=David|last=Palmer|date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint-Georges majeur au crépuscule''''' (Eng: '''''Dusk in Venice''''', '''''San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight'''''&lt;ref name="NMW" /&gt; or '''''Sunset in Venice''''') refers to an [[Impressionist]] painting by [[Claude Monet]], which exists in more than one version. It forms part of a series of views of the monastery-island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. This series is in turn part of a larger series of views of [[Venice]] which Monet began in 1908 during his only visit there.

==Versions in Cardiff and Tokyo==
One version of ''San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk'' was acquired in Paris by the Welsh art collector [[Gwendoline Davies]]. She bequeathed it to the Art Gallery (now [[National Museum Cardiff]]) in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].  The painting is normally on display there.&lt;ref name="NMW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1336 | title=San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight | publisher=National Museum Wales ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Amgueddfa Cymru) | accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Western"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242800392.html | title=The Duck Pond That Grew into a 'French' Lake; How Did Claude Monet's Famous Paintings of Water Lilies Inspire Wales' Greatest Art-Collecting Sisters? | publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|''Western Mail'']] | author=Williams, Sally (2010)}} Retrieved 2014 via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

The other version is in the [[Bridgestone Museum of Art]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Bridgestone"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bridgestone-museum.gr.jp/en/collection/works/2/ | title=Twilight, Venice | publisher=Bridgestone Museum of Art | accessdate=2 February 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112850/http://www.bridgestone-museum.gr.jp/en/collection/works/2/ | archivedate=2 February 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'': Description of the painting==
''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'' is approximately two-by-three feet and painted in oil on canvas. It depicts mysterious buildings that seem to magically appear from the surrounding landscape, they almost seem to float in the background.  The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity.  The painting focuses on the [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] and the mouth of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].

==Monet and San Giorgio Maggiore==
Monet painted the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in six lighting conditions. With this varied approach, the paintings focused on the ‘nature of experience.’
He was particularly impressed by the Venetian sunsets, “these splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.” He had previously been inspired by other sunsets, such as those of [[Normandy]] (in ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]'' and ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', his series of the 1890s) and London ([[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|''Houses of Parliament'']]).

===Viewpoints===
[[File:Isola di s giorgio maggiore pano.jpg|thumbnail|This photo separates the campanile and dome of San Giorgio Maggiore, as it is taken from a position nearer the Grand Canal than the dusk paintings.]]
Monet and his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] stayed at the [[Palazzo Barbaro]] for a couple of weeks, and then moved to the Hotel Britannia, where they stayed until December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/en/hotel-history The hotel's name has since changed to the Hotel Europa and Regina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218062329/http://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/en/hotel-history |date=2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mme. Monet, the Britannia had a view, "if such a thing were possible, even more beautiful than that of Palazzo Barbaro..." 
Monet painted looking out from this hotel, but not, it seems, in the case of this particular painting. Although the view from the hotel included the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, the painting at dusk appears to have been viewed from the waterfront known as the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]], where the island forms a focal point of the view.
Monet was reportedly reluctant to paint from the waterfront. He disliked crowds of tourists and he was also worried about conforming to other artists who were drawn to Venice, such as [[Renoir]] or [[Manet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/extramural/exhibitions/article/manet-ritorno-a-venezia-36755.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=253&amp;cHash=b2bbf4444d Manet. Ritorno a Venezia]. [[Musée d'Orsay]]&lt;/ref&gt;  San Giorgio Maggiore was a favorite subject for painters, including the proto-Impressionist [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-early-morning-d15254 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore - Early Morning 1819]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-at-sunset-from-the-hotel-europa-d32165 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore at Sunset, from the Hotel Europa 1840]. [[Tate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion of the paintings in France==
Monet felt Venice was a city "too beautiful to be painted",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermonet.com/venice/ Claude Monet in Venice]&lt;/ref&gt; which may be why he returned with many paintings unfinished to [[Giverny]], his home in France.&lt;ref name=ima /&gt;  However, he had already retreated from his earlier practice of painting from life, in front of the subject. He worked on the Venetian scenes at home and the death of his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] in 1911 seems to have been a factor in their completion. 
[[File:Claude Monet - Twilight, Venice.jpg|thumbnail|Version owned by the Bridgestone Museum of Art in Tokyo.]]

==Dispersal==
In 1912 the Venice paintings were mainly dispersed as a result of a successful exhibition of twenty-nine canvases. This exhibition, entitled ''Claude Monet Venise'', was held at the gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] in Paris. The same gallery had hosted exhibitions of the Rouen and London series.

== In popular culture ==

The painting became familiar in 1999 after its appearance in [[John McTiernan]]’s [[heist film]] [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|''The Thomas Crown Affair'']]. In the film the picture is taken from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].  In fact, the Metropolitan does not own the painting, although they have another of Monet's Venetian scenes ''[[The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore (Claude Monet)|The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore]]''.

==See also==
Other paintings from Monet's [[San Giorgio Maggiore (Monet series)|''San Giorgio Maggiore'' series]] are to be seen in Cardiff and [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name=ima&gt;[http://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/56280 The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice], Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

In 2014, Bart Verheggen of the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] surveyed 1,868 climate scientists. They found that, consistent with other research, the level of agreement on anthropogenic causation correlated with expertise - 90% of those surveyed with more than 10 peer-reviewed papers related to climate (just under half of survey respondents) explicitly agreed that  greenhouse gases was the main cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verheggen|first1=Bart|last2=Strengers|first2=Bart|last3=Cook|first3=John|last4=van Dorland|first4=Rob|last5=Vringer|first5=Kees|last6=Peters|first6=Jeroen|last7=Visser|first7=Hans|last8=Meyer|first8=Leo|title=Scientists’ Views about Attribution of Global Warming|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|date=19 August 2014|volume=48|issue=16|pages=8963–8971|doi=10.1021/es501998e|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es501998e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== John Cook ''et al.'', 2013 ==

Cook ''et al.'' examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991–2011 that matched the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013" /&gt; They found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW, 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"/&gt;

In their discussion of the results in 2007, the authors said that the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW is as expected in a consensus situation,&lt;ref name="Oreskes_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oreskes|first=Naomi|title=Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=72|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/resources/globalwarming/oreskes-chapter-4.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2013|chapter=The scientific consensus on climate change: how do we know we're not wrong?|quote=[Scientists] generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics."&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John |author2=Dana Nuccitelli |author3=Sarah A Green |author4=Mark Richardson |author5=Bärbel Winkler |author6=Rob Painting |author7=Robert Way |author8=Peter Jacobs |author9=Andrew Skuce|title=Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=May 2013|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]]|authorlink=John Cook (Australian scientist)|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Education'' in August 2013 [[David Legates]] and three coauthors reviewed the corpus used by Cook ''et al.'' In their assessment, "inspection of a claim by Cook ''et al.'' (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1% consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3% endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic."

However, as the paper took issue in the definition of consensus, the definition of consensus was split into several levels: In the end, of all the abstracts that took a position on the subject, 22.97% and 72.50% were found to take an explicit but unquantified endorsement position or an implicit endorsement position, respectively.  The 0.3% figure represents abstracts taking a position of "Actually endorsing the standard definition" of all the abstracts (1.02% of all position-taking abstracts), where the "standard definition" was juxtaposed with an "unquantified definition" drawn from the 2013 Cook ''et al.'' paper as follows:
* The unquantified definition: "The consensus position that humans are causing global warming" 
* The standard definition: As stated in their introduction, that "human activity is very likely causing most of the current warming (anthropogenic global warming, or AGW)" 
Criticism was also made to the "arbitrary" exclusion of non-position-taking abstracts as well as other issues of definitions.

Climate economist [[Richard Tol]] has also been a persistent critic of the Cook ''et al.'' paper, arguing that the authors "used an unrepresentative sample, left out much useful data, used biased observers who disagreed with the authors of the papers they were classifying nearly two-thirds of the time, and collected and analysed the data in such a way as to allow the authors to adjust their preliminary conclusions as they went along".&lt;ref&gt;[http://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/06/climate-wars-done-science/ The Climate Wars’ Damage to Science] by [[Matt Ridley]], [[Quadrant magazine]],  June 19th 2015.

== Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012 ==

Lefsrud and Meyer surveyed members of the [[Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta]] (APEGA), a professional association for the [[petroleum industry]] in [[Alberta]]. The aims of the study included examining the respondents' "legitimation of themselves as experts on 'the truth', and their attitudes towards regulatory measures."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Writing later, the authors added, "we surveyed engineers and geologists because their professions dominate the oil industry and their views on climate change influence the positions taken by governments, think tanks and environmental groups."&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"/&gt;

The authors found that 99.4% agreed that the global climate is changing but that "the debate of the causes of climate change is particularly virulent among them." Analyzing their responses, the authors labelled 36% of respondents 'comply with Kyoto', as "they express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; 'Regulation activists' (10%) "diagnose climate change as being both human- and naturally caused, posing a moderate public risk, with only slight impact on their personal life." Skeptical of anthropogenic warming (sum 51%) they labelled 'nature is overwhelming' (24%), 'economic responsibility' (10%), and 'fatalists' (17%). Respondents giving these responses disagreed in various ways with [[Scientific opinion on climate change|mainstream scientific opinion on climate change]], expressing views such as that climate change is 'natural', that its causes are unknown, that it is harmless, or that regulation such as that represented by [[Kyoto Protocol]] is in itself harmful.&lt;ref name=or&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lefsrud | first1 = L.

They found that respondents that support regulation (46%) ('comply with Kyoto' and 'regulation activists') were "significantly more likely to be lower in the organizational hierarchy, younger, female, and working in government", while those that oppose regulation ('nature is overwhelming' and 'economic responsibility') were "significantly more likely to be more senior in their organizations, male, older, geoscientists, and work in the oil and gas industry".&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Discussing the study in 2013, the authors ask if such political divisions distract decision-makers from confronting the risk that climate change presents to businesses and the economy.&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"&gt;"[http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2013/03/risk-management-approach-could-motivate-climate-change-action/ Risk Management Approach Could Motivate Climate Change Action]", Lianne Lefsrud and Renate Meyer, ''[[Social Science Space]]'', March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2011 paper published in the ''[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]'', researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 scientists working in academia, government, and industry. The scientists polled were members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] or the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) and listed in the 23rd edition of [[American Men and Women of Science]] (AGU), a biographical reference work on leading American scientists, and 489 returned completed questionnaires. Of those who replied, 97% agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that "human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring," 5% disagreed, and 12% didn't know.&lt;ref&gt;

The authors of the paper say that their database of researchers "is not comprehensive nor designed to be representative of the entire [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate science community]]," but say that since they drew the researchers from the most high-profile reports and public statements, it is likely that it represents the "strongest and most credentialed" researchers both 'convinced by the evidence' (CE) and 'unconvinced by the evidence' (UE) on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/2010/06/scientists-convinced-climate-consensus-more-prominent-opponents-says-paper Scientists 'Convinced' of Climate Consensus More Prominent Than Opponents, Says Paper] by [[Eli Kintisch]], "Science Insider", [[Science (journal)|Science]], 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey was designed to take less than two minutes to complete. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures had generally risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. 76 out of the 79 respondents who "listed climate science as their area of expertise, and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change", thought that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Of those 79 scientists, 75 out of the 77 answered that human activity was a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures, a sample size which would result in a margin of error of 11 percentage points. The remaining two were not asked, because in question one they responded that temperatures had remained relatively constant. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent respectively thinking that human activity was a significant contributing factor.

The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.&lt;ref name=BvS2010/&gt;

In the section on climate change impacts, questions 20 and 21 were relevant to scientific opinion on climate change.
Question 20, "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?" Answers:  67.1% very much convinced (7), 26.7% to some large extent (5–6), 6.2% said to some small extent (2–4), none said not at all.
Question 21, "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?" Answers:  34.6% very much convinced (7), 48.9% being convinced to a large extent (5–6), 15.1% to a small extent (2–4), and 1.35% not convinced at all (1).&lt;ref name=BvS2010/&gt;

The author analyzed 928 abstracts of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, listed with the keywords "global climate change". Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. 75% of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories, thus either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] climate change; none of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

In 2003, Bray and von Storch conducted a survey of the perspectives of climate scientists on global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Scientists’ Perceptions of Climate Change Science.|url=https://www.academia.edu/4484361/Climate_Scientists_Perceptions_of_Climate_Change_Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries. The 2003 survey has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. The survey required entry of a username and password, but the username and password were circulated to a climate skeptics mailing list and elsewhere on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Bray and von Storch defended their results and accused climate change skeptics of interpreting the results with bias. Bray's submission to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on December 22, 2004 was rejected.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

One of the questions asked in the survey was ''"To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?"'', with a value of 1 indicating strongly agree and a value of 7 indicating strongly disagree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/08/climate_scientists_views_on_cl_1.html Climate scientists’ views on climate change: a survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed a mean of 3.62, with 50 responses (9.4%) indicating "strongly agree" and 54 responses (9.7%) indicating "strongly disagree". The same survey indicates a 72% to 20% endorsement of the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that ''"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions."''{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== 1990s ==

* In 1997, the conservative think tank [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] surveyed America's 48 [[American Association of State Climatologists|state climatologists]] on questions related to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980525144333/http://www.cse.org/surveyenviroreg100897.htm Citizens For a Sound Economy Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 36 respondents, 44% considered global warming to be a largely natural phenomenon, compared to 17% who considered warming to be largely man-made. 89% agreed that "current science is unable to isolate and measure variations in global temperatures caused ONLY by man-made factors," and 61% said that historical data do not indicate "that fluctuations in global temperatures are attributable to human influences such as burning fossil fuels", though the time scale for the next glacial period was not specified.
* In 1996, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch undertook a survey of climate scientists on attitudes towards global warming and related matters. The results were subsequently published in the [[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="Bray_von_Storch_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281999%29080%3C0439%3ACSAEEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title=Climate Science: An Empirical Example of Postnormal Science | journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society | last=Bray | first=Dennis |author2=[[Hans von Storch]]  | year=1999 | accessdate=2007-09-04|format=PDF | doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1999)080&lt;0439:CSAEEO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume=80 | pages=439–455 | issn=1520-0477 | issue=3|bibcode = 1999BAMS...80..439B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper addressed the views of climate scientists, with a response rate of 40% from a mail survey questionnaire to 1000 scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada. Most of the scientists accepted that global warming was occurring and appropriate policy action should be taken, but there was wide disagreement about the likely effects on society and almost all agreed that the predictive ability of currently existing models was limited. On a scale of 1 (highest confidence) to 7 (lowest confidence) regarding belief in the ability to make "reasonable predictions" the mean was 4.8 and 5.2 for 10- and 100-year predictions, respectively. On the question of whether global warming is occurring or will occur, the mean response was 3.3, and for future prospects of warming the mean was 2.6.
* A [[Gallup poll]] of 400 members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] and the [[American Meteorological Society]] along with an analysis of reporting on global warming by the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], a report on which was issued in 1992. Accounts of the results of that survey differ in their interpretation and even in the basic statistical percentages:
** [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] states that the report said that 67% of the scientists said that human-induced global warming was occurring, with 11% disagreeing and the rest undecided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1307 R. Nixon, "Limbaughesque Science"], citing a press release by Gallup in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[George Will]] reported "53 percent do not believe warming has occurred, and another 30 percent are uncertain." (''Washington Post'', September 3, 1992). In a correction Gallup stated: "Most scientists involved in research in this area believe that human-induced global warming is occurring now."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1156 Steve Rendall, "The Hypocrisy of George Will"], FAIR report, citing the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SymmetryOfLifeFormsOnEarth.jpg|thumb|300px|A selection of animals showing a range of possible body  symmetries, including both asymmetry, radial and bilateral [[body plan]]s]]

'''Symmetry in biology''' is the balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. In nature and biology, [[symmetry]] is always approximate. For example, plant leaves – while considered symmetrical – rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry creates a class of  [[patterns in nature]], where the near-repetition of the pattern element is by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].

The [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit some form of symmetry, whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A small minority, notably among the [[sponge]]s, exhibit no symmetry (i.e., are asymmetric). Symmetry was once important in animal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; the [[Radiata]], animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s classification of the animal kingdom.

==Radial symmetry==
{{Redirect|Radial symmetry|radial symmetry in mathematics|rotational symmetry}}
[[File:Haeckel Actiniae.jpg|thumb|upright|These sea anemones have been painted to emphasize their radial symmetry. ([[Photographic plate|Plate]] from [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'').]]

Radially symmetric organisms resemble a pie where several cutting [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s produce roughly identical pieces. Such an organism exhibits no left or right sides. They have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.

Symmetry has been important historically in the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of animals; [[Georges Cuvier]] classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon [[Radiata]] (''Zoophytes''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben M. |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=8 March 2018 |quote=Cuvier's insistence on the functional integration of organisms led him to classify animals into four "branches," or embranchements: Vertebrata, Articulata (arthropods and segmented worms), Mollusca (which at the time meant all other soft, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates), and Radiata (cnidarians and echinoderms).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |author1link=Georges Cuvier |last2=Griffith |first2=Edward |last3=Pidgeon |first3=Edward |title=The Mollusca and Radiata: Arranged by the Baron Cuvier, with Supplementary Additions to Each Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mskQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA435 |year=1834 |publisher=Whittaker and Company |pages=435–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now generally accepted to be a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] assemblage of different phyla of the [[Animal]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hadzi |first=J. |title=The Evolution of the Metazoa |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0080100791 |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth[[Talk:Ancient Greek medicine|,]] to the center of the opposite, {{linktext|aboral}}, end. Radial symmetry is especially suitable for [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals such as the [[sea anemone]], floating animals such as [[jellyfish]], and slow moving organisms such as [[starfish]]. Animals in the phyla [[Cnidaria]] and [[Echinoderm]]ata are radially symmetric,&lt;ref name=IAS/&gt; although many sea anemones and some corals have bilateral symmetry defined by a single structure, the [[siphonoglyph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Finnerty, J.R. | title=The origins of axial patterning in the metazoa: How old is bilateral symmetry? | journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume=47 | pages=523–9 | year=2003 | id=14756328 16341006 | pmid=14756328 | issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LiliumBulbiferumCroceumBologna.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lilium bulbiferum]]'' displays typical [[floral symmetry]] with repeated parts arranged around the axis of the flower.]]

Many flowers are radially symmetric or [[Floral symmetry|actinomorphic]]. Roughly identical flower parts – [[petal]]s, [[sepal]]s, and [[stamen]]s – occur at regular intervals around the axis of the flower, which is often the female part, with the [[carpel]], [[style (botany)|style]] and [[stigma (botany)|stigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endress, P.

Many viruses have radial symmetries, their coats being composed of a relatively small number of protein molecules arranged in a regular pattern to form polyhedrons, spheres, or ovoids. Most are [[icosahedron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268226190366X | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R.

===Special forms of radial symmetry===

{{vanchor|Tetramerism}} is a variant of radial symmetry found in [[jellyfish]], which have four canals in an otherwise radial [[body plan]].

[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Apple cut horizontally, showing pentamerism]]

{{vanchor|Pentamerism}} (also called pentaradial and pentagonal symmetry) means the organism is in five parts around a central axis, 72° apart. Among animals, only the [[echinodermata|echinoderms]] such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being [[bilateria]]n animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flowering plant]]s show fivefold symmetry in many flowers and in various fruits. This is well seen in the arrangement of the five [[carpel]]s (the botanical fruits containing the seeds) in an [[apple]] cut transversely.

{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) which are divided into two groups based on their symmetry.  The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp]]s have sixfold internal symmetry and the number of their [[tentacle]]s is a multiple of six.

{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.

==Spherical symmetry==
[[File:Mikrofoto.de-volvox-4.jpg|thumb|''[[Volvox]]'' is a microscopic green freshwater [[alga]] with spherical symmetry. Young colonies can be seen inside the larger ones.]]

Spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga ''[[Volvox]]''.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iaszoology.com/symmetry/ | title=Symmetry | publisher=IAS | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Chandra, Girish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateral symmetry==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] --&gt;
{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}
&lt;!--[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|right|thumb|A [[leaf]] showing (imperfect) bilateral symmetry.]]--&gt;
{{main|Bilateria}}

In bilateral symmetry (also called ''plane symmetry''), only one plane, called the [[sagittal plane]], divides an organism into roughly [[mirror image]] halves. Thus there is approximate [[reflection symmetry]]. Internal organs are however not necessarily symmetric.

[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]

[[Bilateria|Animals that are bilaterally symmetric]] have mirror symmetry in the sagittal plane, which divides the body vertically into left and right halves, with one of each [[sense organ]] and limb group on either side. At least 99% of animals are bilaterally symmetric, including humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118213208/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D802620 |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/evolution/what-is-the-evidence/morphology/bilateralism/ | title=Bilateral symmetry | publisher=Natural History Museum | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnerty&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://faculty.weber.edu/rmeyers/PDFs/Finnerty%20-%20symmetry%20evol.pdf | title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? | author=Finnerty, John R. | journal=BioEssays | year=2005 | volume=27 | pages=1174–1180 | doi=10.1002/bies.20299 | pmid=16237677}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[facial symmetry]] influences people's judgements of attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Grammer1994"&gt;Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R.

When an organism normally moves in one direction, it inevitably has a front or head end. This end encounters the environment before the rest of the body as the organism moves along, so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there, and similarly it is the likely site for a mouth as food is encountered.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt; A distinct head, with sense organs connected to a [[central nervous system]], therefore (on this view) tends to develop ([[cephalization]]). Given a direction of travel which creates a front/back difference, and [[gravity]] which creates a dorsal/ventral difference, left and right are unavoidably distinguished, so a bilaterally symmetric [[body plan]] is widespread and found in most animal phyla.&lt;!--including [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms), [[Arthropoda]] (e.g. insects), [[Annelida]] (e.g. earthworms), [[Mollusca]] (e.g. squids, though not in helically coiled snails) and [[Chordata]] (e.g. fish and mammals)--&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/arthropods_04 | title=Bilateral (left/right) symmetry | publisher=Berkeley | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilateral symmetry also permits [[wikt:streamline|streamlining]] to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]], and on a traditional view in zoology facilitates locomotion.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt; However, in the [[Cnidaria]], different symmetries exist, and bilateral symmetry is not necessarily aligned with the direction of locomotion, so another mechanism such as internal transport may be needed to explain the origin of bilateral symmetry in animals.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt;&lt;ref name=MartindaleHenry/&gt;

[[File:Haeckel Asteridea Larvae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Starfish larvae|[[Starfish]] [[larvae]] are [[bilaterally symmetric]], whereas the adults have [[#Pentamerism|fivefold symmetry]].]]
The phylum [[Echinodermata]], which includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[sand dollars]], is unique among animals in having bilateral symmetry at the larval stage, but pentamerism (fivefold symmetry) as adults.&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lanwebs.lander.edu/faculty/rsfox/invertebrates/asterias.html | title=''Asterias forbesi'' | author=Fox, Richard | work=Invertebrate Anatomy OnLine | publisher=Lander University | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral symmetry is not easily broken. In experiments using the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila]]'', in contrast to other traits (where laboratory [[artificial selection|selection]] experiments always yield a change), right- or left-sidedness in eye size, or [[eye facet]] number, wing-folding behavior (left over right) show a lack of response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/palmer.hp/asym/axes/symmetry.htm Symmetry breaking in fruit flies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Females of some species select for symmetry, presumed by biologists to be a mark (technically a "cue") of fitness. Female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]). The lip of the flower resembles the (bilaterally symmetric) abdomen of a female bee; pollination occurs when a male bee attempts to mate with it.]]

Flowers in some families of flowering plants, such as the [[Orchidaceae|orchid]] and [[Fabaceae|pea]] families, and also most of the [[Scrophulariaceae|figwort family]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/301Manhart/Dicots/Asteridae/Scr/Scr.html | title=SCROPHULARIACEAE - Figwort or Snapdragon Family | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Bioinformatics Working Group | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are bilaterally symmetric ([[zygomorphic]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biradial symmetry==
Biradial symmetry is a combination of radial and bilateral symmetry, as in the [[ctenophore]]s. Here, the body components are arranged with similar parts on either side of a central axis, and each of the four sides of the body is identical to the opposite side but different from the adjacent side. This may represent a stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry "from a presumably radially symmetrical ancestor."&lt;ref name=MartindaleHenry&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/4/672.full.pdf | title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality1 |author1=Martindale, Mark Q. |author2=Henry, Jonathan Q. | journal=American Zoology | year=1998 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=672–684 | doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymmetry==
{{further|List of animals featuring external asymmetry}}

Not all animals are symmetric. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale-eating [[cichlid]] ''[[Perissodus microlepis]]'' develops left or right asymmetries in their mouths and jaws that allow them to be more effective when removing scales from the left or right flank of their prey.&lt;ref name=Lee2012&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee, H.

The approximately 400 species of [[flatfish]] also lack symmetry as adults, though the larvae are bilaterally symmetrical.

'''''The Distrest Poet''''' is an [[oil painting]] produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist [[William Hogarth]]. Reproduced as an [[etching]] and [[engraving]], it was published in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) p.165&lt;/ref&gt; The scene was probably inspired by [[Alexander Pope]]'s [[satire|satirical]] poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.  It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing.  Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.

== Background ==
[[Image:Enraged musician.jpg|right|thumb|''The Enraged Musician''.]]
The engraving of ''The Distrest Poet'' in its third state was issued on 15 December 1741 as a companion piece to ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'', a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the noise from the street outside his practice room. The initial plate for ''The Distrest Poet'' was produced soon after Hogarth had completed the oil painting, but the third state plate was not completed until late in 1740 at which time Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: ''The Provok'd Musician'', ''The Distrest Poet'', and a third image on the subject of "Painting". ''The Provok'd Musician'' (renamed ''The Enraged Musician'') was produced in 1741 but the third image was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Picture ==
[[Image:The distrest poet.jpg|right|thumb|The third state print, completed in 1740 and issued in 1741, featured a different bill above the poet's head.]]
The scene is set in a small and messy [[garret]], sparsely furnished by a few pieces of crude furniture.  The room is poorly kept, with cracking plaster, a broken window and uneven floor, and a bare cupboard. In this way, Hogarth underlines the desperate circumstances of the occupants and the poverty of the family.

Starved of inspiration and suffering [[writer's block]], the poet sits on the end of his bed in his night gown, quill in hand, scratching his head.  A copy of [[Edward Bysshe (writer)|Edward Bysshe]]'s ''The Art of English Poetry'', a guide to composition published in 1702, lies open on the table. A copy of Popes's satirical ''[[Grub Street Journal]]'' lies on the floor near his feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ci.uc.pt/pessoal/mportela/arslonga/MPENSAIOS/a_portrait_of_the_author.htm|title=A Portrait of the Author as an Author|author=Manuel Portela|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few feet to his right sits his wife, darning the clothes on her lap and those sprawled on the floor, where a cat sits, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes unattended in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals the last of the family's food from a plate.

Other, less obvious, elements of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled "Upon Riches", which suggests that the poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry.&lt;ref&gt;Postmus p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was ''The Poet's Ramble After Riches'', which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture.&lt;ref name="Hallett"/&gt; Earlier impressions showed the poem as "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair in the back of the room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/hogarth_william_thedistrestpoet.htm |title=William Hogarth – The Distrest Poet|accessdate=8 January 2007|publisher=ArtOfThePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.&lt;ref name="Hallett" /&gt;

=== Alexander Pope ===
[[Image:Pope-Alexander.png|thumb|right|upright|Hogarth reproduced this image of "Pope Alexander" in the painting, but whether his intention was to mock Pope or Pope's opponents is unclear. By the time the print was issued, the image of Pope had been removed.]]
The scene shown in ''The Distrest Poet'' was probably inspired by [[Alexander Pope]]'s satirical poem ''[[The Dunciad]]'', most likely by the prefatory matter of the second version, the ''Dunciad Variorum'' which had been published in 1735, and in which Pope confirmed his authorship of the original. The painting and early states of the print included a quotation from Pope's work:
{{quote|
Studious he sate, with all his books around,&lt;br/&gt;
Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound:&lt;br/&gt;
Plunged for his sense, but found no bottom there;&lt;br/&gt;
Then wrote and flounder'd on, in mere despair.}}
The bill stuck to the wall above the poet's head originally featured a reference to Pope in which he was punningly mocked as "His Holiness Pope Alexander", depicted as an ape wearing a [[papal tiara]] with an ass as his Prime Minister. The initial states of the print kept the quotation but replaced the genuine bill with a representation (which appears to have been entirely invented by Hogarth rather than copied from a real bill) of Pope clashing with [[Edmund Curll]] over the unauthorised publication of the poet's correspondence. Although Hogarth and Pope had never met, this literary inspiration led to speculation as to the identity of Hogarth's poet as one of the targets of Pope's satire. [[Ned Ward]], the author of ''[[The London Spy]]'' was a strong contender,&lt;ref name="Hallett"&gt;Hallett p.137&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Lewis Theobald]], to whom the lines quoted from Pope in Hogarth's original print referred.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.119–20&lt;/ref&gt; 

How far Hogarth sympathised with Pope is questionable. The original bill mocked him, but it featured in an image that, at the least, poked fun at the poor poet who was the subject. Hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for Pope or that he placed Pope's image above his head as a model to which to aspire. In the second image, which shows Pope and Curll locked in battle, it is not clear who has the upper hand, and by the time the print was issued the direct reference to Pope had been removed completely. [[Ronald Paulson]], the preeminent modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that Hogarth would have viewed Pope, through his Roman Catholicism, as having been implicitly tied to the continental influences that Hogarth despised, and would have seen Pope's refusal to accept the patronage of the great men of the time, while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping the rewards they had to offer, as hypocritical. Pope was part of the circle that included [[William Kent]] and [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] who had displaced Hogarth's father-in-law [[James Thornhill]] from commissions, and Hogarth also had ties to Lewis Theobald, a possible target of the satire, through illustrations he had produced for Theobald's ''Perseus and Andromeda'', and through his subscription to Theobald's edition of the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Paulson suggests that the real "villain" of ''The Distrest Poet'' may be Pope, unseen but representing the successful "Great Poet" whom the deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate, rather than the distressed poet himself.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.120–22&lt;/ref&gt;  Hogarth had featured Pope picking [[John Gay]]'s pocket in the foreground of ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'', an early print he had produced on the theme of the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] (both Pope and Gay had invested money in the scheme).&lt;ref&gt;Wharton p.191&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, within the satire of the painting, the poet who is distressed is going to be one of Pope's [[dunce]]s.  

The lines by Pope, though referring to Theobald, the hero of ''The Dunciad'', are a characterisation of a [[Grub Street]] hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/rooms/room5.shtm|title=Hogarth – Room 5|publisher=Tate Online|accessdate=8 January 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209045218/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/rooms/room5.shtm|archivedate=9 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting would be one of this fraternity of "witlings" who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the ''poet'' to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of  [[Macheath]] on her wall in ''[[A Harlot's Progress]],'' this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's "side" in the battle between dunces and men of wit.

Hogarth was well acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who had been unable to make a living as writer and had eventually ended up at the [[Fleet Prison]] as a bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 1) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.&lt;ref&gt;Uglow pp.29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Divine Comedy Symphony''''' is [[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]’s first complete [[symphonic band]] [[symphony]]. It was based on [[Dante]]'s epic, [[The Divine Comedy]]. Smith had studied this, and Homer’s [[Odyssey]], at Troy.

The classical symphony consists of four movements – each following a distinct pattern.&lt;ref name="Rohner2005"&gt;{{cite book

|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement One: “The Inferno”==
“The Inferno” was commissioned by the [[James Madison University]] Band, and was completely published in 1995. The movement follows the events of the epic poem, using musical references to the events in select [[canto]]s of ''Inferno''. An Oboe solo in B-flat minor begins the symphony,then, Enormous crescendos, violent percussion, and towering blocks of sound quickly lead the audience into Dante’s vision of hell. A furious ostinato is used three times in this piece, first by [[flute]]s, then [[clarinet]]s, and finally by the [[saxophone]]s. In typical [[overture]] form, the song slows down as Dante makes his way down in the very depths of hell. Each of the movements in this symphony have a vocal effect, and in the Inferno, this takes the form of howls of pain, balanced rhythmically with whip cracks. The piece takes a coda, and finishes with an extremely difficult timpani solo accompanied by violent and sporadic hits of the [[gong]], although many performances however, omit this solo and instead have the timpani rolling into silence on a B-flat due to the difficulty.  The [[oboe]], [[piccolo]], and [[timpani]] feature prominently in this movement.

==Movement Two: “Purgatorio”==
Also commissioned by the James Madison University Band and published in 1997, Purgatorio continues Dante's epic through expressive solos and percussion rhythms.  The piece is separated into three main parts:  a lilting, dragging theme accented by [[soprano saxophone]] and flute solos, the Earthquake (which encompasses most of the piece), and the return of the original melody.  Vocalizations occur frequently during this piece, first with certain players "moaning in pain" as they drag heavy loads, then with the chants of "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" during the Earthquake, and finally with singing.  During the first and last parts of the piece, most of the band drags their feet on the ground before stomping in a repetitive rhythm.  The soprano saxophone is the featured instrument in the piece, playing notable solos that usually herald transitions between parts; this instrument leads the band all the way to the end of the piece, as the souls' footsteps gradually fade into the distance.  The piece begins in the key of D minor, modulates to C minor for the Earthquake section, and then modulates back to D minor for the conclusion of the piece.

==Movement Three: “The Ascension”==

Commissioned by the [[George Mason University]] Band, "The Ascension" represents Dante's ascension into heaven.  The piece follows typical overture form, starting out with Dante looking up to the stars atop Mount Purgatory.  A swift [[French horn|horn]] motif starts Dante's ascension, moving faster than thought.  Technically difficult woodwind runs add to the speed of Dante's ascension, as well as loud, dissonant trombone glissandos.  The middle of the piece slows down, where the band sings accompanied by bowed [[vibraphone]] and pitched wine glasses.  The opening theme of the movement is repeated in the woodwinds, while the remainder of the band sings "alleluia."  After a short horn solo, the music of the gods and of heaven builds to a climax with a trumpet solo, which is then expanded on by the rest of the band.  The piece then speeds up again with the same horn motif, finishing with a climactic and dramatic crescendo to the final note, as Dante finally arrives in Heaven.  The movement begins in E-flat major, modulates to C minor, then modulates to B-flat major at the trumpet solo.  When the horn motif returns, the piece once again modulates to C minor, where it stays for the rest of the piece. This movement prominently features horn, [[trumpet]], and [[piano]].

==Movement Four: “Paradiso”==
Published in 1996, the final movement of the symphony is a piece filled with emotion and powerful music.  The piece uses an extended [[mallet percussion]] section to introduce itself, before handing the melody over to the horns in four-part harmony.  The vocalization reveals itself quite early in the piece, as the rest of the band sings "ah" to the oboe solo.  The mallet percussion cuts off where the timpani begins.  The theme from the beginning of "The Ascension" serves as the theme for the final half of the piece.  After a modulation, the music rises dramatically into a final suspended note, as Dante finally "glimpses the face of God".  A timpani solo accents the sustained note, and rolls into the full band's final, triumphant note.  The composer designed the opening of the song to act as Dante's rise into Heaven:  with each new beam of light that appears, another mallet percussion part or rhythm is added to the building melody.  The piece is the shortest of the four at almost five minutes and is easily the piece that is most filled with raw emotion.  It begins in the key of E-flat major, and modulates into the key of F major during the return of the theme from "The Ascension."

'''"The Frost King"''' was a short story about King [[Jack Frost]] written by 12-year-old [[Helen Keller]].&lt;ref name="Berube"&gt;Bérubé, Michael. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030804/berube Written in Memory], ''The Nation.'' July 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Keller's teacher, [[Anne Sullivan]], had mentioned that the autumn leaves were "painted ruby, emerald, gold, crimson, and brown," and Keller, by her own account, imagined [[fairies]] doing the work. Keller wrote a story about how a cask of jewels, being transported by fairy servants, had melted in the sun and covered the leaves.&lt;ref name="upenn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/part-III.html#Style |title=Part III, The Story of My Life |publisher=Digital.library.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a birthday gift, Keller sent the story to [[Michael Anagnos]], head of the [[Perkins School for the Blind]], who published the story in ''The Mentor,'' the Perkins alumni magazine. It was picked up by ''[[The Goodson Gazette]]'', a journal on deaf-blind education, based in Virginia.

== Controversy ==
{{see also|Plagiarism|Cryptomnesia}}

A friend, one of the Perkins teachers informed the ''Gazette'' that Keller's story was a reproduction of "Frost Fairies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/mylife/book.asp?ch=P3Ch5app2|title=Consecutive version of "The Frost Fairies" and "The Frost King"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Margaret Canby]]'s book ''Birdie and His Fairy Friends.''

''The Gazette'' ran both stories, and the editor commented that he believed it a deliberate attempt at [[fraud]] by Keller's handlers. Keller insisted she had no memory of having read the book or having had it read to her, but passages in her letters from the period, which she describes as "dreams", strongly resembled other episodes in the book.&lt;ref name="upenn1"/&gt;

In Sullivan's account of the incident, addressed to [[John Hitz]] of the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Bureau]], she had investigated to see who could have read the story to Helen or even owned a copy of the book. It seemed her own mentor, Sophia Hopkins, had taken charge of the then eight-year-old Keller while Sullivan was on vacation, and had read the book to her through [[finger spelling]]. Keller stated that she remembered nothing of this, and she was devastated that people she had loved and trusted would accuse her of lying.&lt;ref&gt;"It made us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and wicked. My heart was full of tears, for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart and mind." From "Helen Keller's Own Statement," from her diary, dated 1892, January 30, and printed in ''[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/life.html#Style The Story of My Life]'' in the chapter "Literary Style."&lt;/ref&gt;

References to '''King Frost''' in popular culture include the temporal ''"The reign of King Frost had begun"'' in a 1920s dime romance novel.&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clay |first=Bertha M |year=1923 |title=Thorns and Orange Blossoms |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b248489;view=1up;seq=5 |accessdate=2016-08-21 |location=New York |publisher=J. H. Sears &amp; Co |asin=B000GSXUDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Anagnos was apparently willing to believe that Keller had simply adapted the story from buried memories. However, Keller further discussed the matter with one of the Perkins teachers, and as she remembered it, "something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession" that she had knowingly plagiarized the story. The teacher's own detailed account, which was only discovered in 1978 and published in Joseph Lash's ''Helen and Teacher,'' confirms that Keller told her Sullivan had read her "Frost Fairies" the previous fall and that she had adapted her own story out of that one.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Joseph P. Lash in ''Helen and Teacher'' (DaCapo, 1997), p. 136-138. He cites it as coming from the document ''Miss Sullivan's Methods,'' referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

By all accounts, the teacher reported what Keller had told her to Anagnos. A storm of outrage swept through the school, apparently headed by the teachers. Keller's biographers, particularly Joseph P. Lash, suggest that they were also incensed by the fact that Sullivan and Keller used the facilities although they were neither employed by nor officially registered with the school.&lt;ref&gt;Lash, Joseph P., ''Helen and Teacher.'' DaCapo, 1997, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-house "trial" ensued to determine whether or not Sullivan had deliberately falsified Keller's abilities; eight teachers interrogated the twelve-year-old child for two hours and fought the issue to a draw, the tie-breaking vote being cast by Anagnos in Keller's favor. Although Sullivan protested that "all use of language is imitative, and one's style is made up of all other styles that one has met," and even Canby came forward to say that Keller's version was superior to her own,&lt;ref&gt;"What a wonderfully active and retentive mind that gifted child must have! If she had remembered and written down accurately, a short story, and that soon after hearing it, it would have been a marvel; but to have heard the story once, three years ago, and in such a way that neither her parents nor teacher could ever allude to it or refresh her memory about it, and then to have been able to reproduce it so vividly, even adding some touches of her own in perfect keeping with the rest, which really improve the original, is something that very few girls of riper age, and with every advantage of sight, hearing, and even great talents for composition, could have done as well, if at all." Margaret Canby, quoted by John A. Macy, in [http://www.afb.org/mylife/book.asp?ch=P3Ch5 Literary Style], supplemental chapter to Keller's ''Story of My Life,'' entire text online and found 2008-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Anagnos never regained his faith in Sullivan or Keller and described them years later as "a living lie." Keller had a [[nervous breakdown]] over the incident,{{cn|date=August 2016}} and never wrote fiction again.

In 1978, an anonymously written typescript titled "Miss Sullivan's Methods" was uncovered at the Perkins Institute library.&lt;ref name=Lash&gt;{{cite book |last=Lash |title=Helen and Teacher|first =Joseph P }}, p. 134. See also "Touching Words," by Jim Swan, in ''The Construction of authorship: textual appropriation in Law and Literature'', ed. by Martha Woodmansee, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Lash describes it as an analysis of ''The Story of My Life,'' probably written by David Prescott Hall in 1906 just after the death of Michael Anagnos. The text identifies many of Keller's letters as containing paraphrases of Canby's writing, as well as verbatim passages. Keller and Sullivan cited some of these in their own explanation of what happened, and Sullivan stated several times Keller's writings at the time contained extensive paraphrases of either what she had read or what she had ''had'' read ''to'' her. The document also contains the text of the letter written by the Perkins teacher in which she transcribed the conversation with Keller that had led to the inquiry.

Lash believes the author of the document was trying to prove Sullivan, not Hopkins, had read ''Birdie and his Fairy Friends'' to Keller, and had done so that same autumn, not four years previously. He concludes that if this was the case:

* Keller wrote "The Frost King" as another one of her paraphrased stories, similar to what she'd been writing in her letters of the period.
* Sullivan, who always checked Keller's writings before allowing them to be mailed, would have recognized "The Frost King" as a paraphrase, but considering it to be sufficiently original, passed it on as Keller's own work.
* Sullivan may not have understood what plagiarism is.
* When Keller was accused, Sullivan attempted a coverup, denying she had read the ''Birdie'' stories and impressing upon Keller the importance of stating Hopkins had read her the stories years before.

The story was later published in [[The Story of My Life (biography)|Keller's 1903 biography]] with a complete analysis of both stories and the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/biography/StoryofMyLife/chap44.html |title=Story of My Life - The Frost King |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |first=Helen A. |last=Keller |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1903, [[Mark Twain]] described the controversy as "owlishly idiotic and grotesque."&lt;ref name=Twain&gt;{{cite web |last=Twain |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Twain |title=Helen's writing |url=http://www.afb.org/section.aspx?FolderID=1&amp;SectionID=1&amp;TopicID=193&amp;SubTopicID=24&amp;DocumentID=1111|accessdate=2012-06-01 |date=March 17, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Société du Spectacle''''' ('''''Society of the Spectacle''''') is a black and white 1973 film by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]] based on his 1967 [[Society of the Spectacle|book of the same name]]. It was Debord's first feature-length film. It uses [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]] and [[détournement]] in a radical [[Marxist]] [[critique]] of [[mass marketing]] and its role in the [[Social alienation|alienation of modern society]].

==Film content==
The 88 minute film took a year to make and incorporates an apparent jumble of footage from feature films juxtaposed with still photographs, industrial films, early 1970s glossy 'lifestyle' TV ads, and news footage of unrest in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6113599464218751854 The pussies of Guy Debord]'', selected excerpts from the film&lt;/ref&gt; The feature films include ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'', ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', and ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'', as well as other Soviet films.

Throughout the film, there are intertitles consisting of quotations from ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', along with Debord (in voice-over) reading texts from [[Marx]], [[Machiavelli]], the 1968 [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Émile Pouget]], and [[Sergey Solovyov]] and others. Without citations, these quotes are hard to decipher, especially with the conflicting subtitles (which exist even in the French version): but that is part of Debord's goal to "problematize reception" (Greil and Sanborn) and force the viewer to be active. In addition, the words of some of the authors are [[détournement|détourned]] through deliberate misquoting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/SOTS-detournements.html Guide to the détournements in ''The Society of the Spectacle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of historical events is included, such as the murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (the assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963), the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[May 1968 in France|Paris riots]] in May 1968, along with clips of people such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the Spanish anarchist [[Durruti]].

In 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron [[Gerard Lebovici]]. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife [[Alice Becker-Ho]] has been promoting Debord's film. A DVD box set titled ''Guy Debord: Oeuvres cinématographiques complètes'' was released in 2005 and contains Debord's seven films.

==Music==
The piece used in the film is [http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/9/9e/IMSLP74228-PMLP148883-Corrette_Délices.pdf#page=22 ''Les Delices de la Solitude'', Op. 20 No. 6] - Sonata in D Major : I. ''Allegro Moderato'', by [[Michel Corrette]].

But even without dialogue, French filmmaker Laurent Touil-Tartour has made an unusually sophisticated spy-tech thriller.”&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

Critic Jandy Stone Hardesty, in her review for Row Three, said that Touil-Tartour has “a nice flair for composition and a good sense of visual storytelling, he also knows how to do good twists and suggest things rather than spell them out, something I really appreciated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jandy Hardesty |url=http://www.rowthree.com/2010/05/16/urban-wolf-is-watching-you/ |title=Urban Wolf is watching you |publisher=rowthree.com |date= May 16, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bibbiani, in ''[[CraveOnline]]'', called it "an exciting little bit of filmmaking that deserves its notoriety and is worth howling about”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William Bibbiani |url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/reviews/138846-urban-wolf-review/ |title=Urban Wolf review |publisher=craveonline.com |date= May 12, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liz Shannon Miller writing in ''[[GigaOM]]'' wrote that "“Urban Wolf is a gripping thriller that stands out as proudly unique. Some of Wolf‘s execution might emulate classic 1970s thrillers, but the concept is pure 21st century, playing nimbly with issues of privacy and paranoia. When a director can make even the eating of a potato chip seem malevolent (as occurs in the yet-to-premiere episode 7), you know you’ve watching something special.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Liz Shannon Miller |url=http://gigaom.com/video/urban-wolf-a-near-perfect-21st-century-thriller/ |title=Urban Wolf a Near-Perfect 21st Century Thriller |publisher=gigaom.com |date= May 13, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing it for the ''[[Mingle Media TV Network]]'', journalist Kristyn Burtt wrote: "The reason this series stands out amongst the pack is its cinematic feel and the utilization of mise en scene.  You don't hear the main character utter a word until Episode 7, and boy, is it effective.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kristyn Burtt |url=http://redcarpetcloset.blogspot.com/2010/05/i-came-upon-this-series-at-last-years.html |title=Urban Wolf behind the scenes |publisher=The Web Files |date= May 17, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awarding the film a five out of five star rating, Feo Amante's film critic E.C.McMullen Jr. wrote: "The tension from episode to episode is incredible and Laurent just keeps ramping it up. With its beautiful settings (shot in Paris, France), excellent cinematography, and super tight, witty action, this could very well define the future of online cinema. I'm not kidding! URBAN WOLF is a Turbo Thrust Cat and Mouse Thriller with a V8 engine!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E.C.McMullen Jr. |url=http://www.feoamante.com/Movies/STU/urban_wolf.html/ |title=Urban Wolf review |publisher=feoamante.com |date= May 14, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Allan''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (1782 &amp;ndash; 23 February 1850) was a distinguished Scottish historical painter known for his scenes of Russian life. He became president of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] and was made a Royal Academician.

==Life and work==
[[File:Sir William Allan - Sir Walter Scott, 1771 - 1832. Novelist and poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Scott, novelist and poet - painted by Sir William Allan]]

Allan was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of William Allan Snr., macer, an officer of the [[Court of Session]]. He was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|High School, Edinburgh]], under William Nicol (1744?-1797), the companion of [[Robert Burns]]. Showing an aptitude for art, he was apprenticed to a coach-painter, and studied under [[John Graham (painter)|John Graham]] at the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]], with [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], and [[Alexander George Fraser]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

After a few years he came to [[London]], and entered the schools of the [[Royal Academy]]. His first exhibited picture was a ''Gipsy Boy with an Ass'' (1803), in the style of [[John Opie]]. 

In 1805 he travelled, by ship, to [[Russia]], but was wrecked at [[Klaipėda|Memel]], where he raised funds for the remaining journey by painting portraits of the Dutch consul and others. He then proceeded overland to [[St. Petersburg]], passing through a great portion of the Russian army on its way to [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. At the Russian capital he found friends, including Sir [[Alexander Crichton]], physician to the imperial family. Having learned Russian, he travelled in the interior of the country, and spent several years in the [[Ukraine]], making excursions to [[Turkey]], [[Tartary]], and elsewhere, studying the culture of [[Cossacks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Tartars]], and collecting arms and armour. In 1809 his picture ''Russian Peasants keeping their Holiday'' was exhibited at the Royal Academy. 

His wish to return home in 1812 had to be postponed due to the [[French invasion of Russia]], many of the horrors of which he witnessed first-hand.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}
[[File:Allan, David - Bashkirs - 1814.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Bashkirs'' (1814, [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]

Allan was able to return to Edinburgh in 1814, and, in 1815, his picture ''Circassian Captives'' attracted notice at the Royal Academy, though it did not find a purchaser. However, Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (1785–1854) and his brother [[James Wilson (zoologist)|James]] (1795–1856), [[John Gibson Lockhart|John Lockhart]], and others, raised a lottery for it, with 100 subscribers at £10 10s. each, and the picture was won by [[Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss]]. Allan remained in Edinburgh, and though his pictures (including ''Tartar Robbers dividing their Spoil'') did not find purchasers amongst his countrymen, some of them were bought by the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas]] when he visited Edinburgh. Allan afterwards painted some scenes from Scottish history suggested by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, such as ''Death of Archbishop Sharpe'' and ''Knox admonishing Mary Queen of Scots'' (exhibited in 1823 and engraved by [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]]). His ''Death of the Regent Murray'' (exhibited 1825) was purchased by the [[Duke of Bedford]] for 800 guineas, and gained the artist his election as an associate of the Royal Academy. 

In 1826 he was appointed master of the Trustees' School, Edinburgh, an office which he held until a few years before his death.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

[[File:Circassian Chief.jpg|thumb|''Circassian Chief'' (1843)]]
Soon afterwards Allan's health gave way, and he was threatened with blindness. To recuperate he went to [[Rome]], and, after spending a winter there, proceeded to [[Naples]], [[Constantinople]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Greece]]. In 1826 he exhibited ''Auld Robin Gray'' and in 1829 ''Prophet Jonah''. In 1830 he returned to Edinburgh, restored to health. His picture ''Slave Market, Constantinople'' was purchased by Alexander Hill, the publisher, and ''Byron in a Fisherman's Hut after swimming the Hellespont'' (exhibited 1831) by R. Nasmyth, who also bought Allan's portraits of Burns and Sir Walter Scott, which were engraved by John Burnet.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In 1832 Allan was living at 8 Scotland Street in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83399643|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=4|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 he visited [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]]. In 1835 he was elected a Royal Academician, and in 1838, on the death of Sir [[George Watson (painter)|George Watson]], was made president of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1841 he went to St. Petersburg, and in the same year succeeded Wilkie as [[Painter and Limner|limner to the queen]] in Scotland, an office which was, as usual, followed (in 1842) by a knighthood.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20105/page/1504 London Gazette, 3 June 1842, page 1504.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Sir William exhibited ''Battle of Waterloo from the English side'', which was purchased by the [[Duke of Wellington]]. The next year he went again to St. Petersburg, where he painted, for the Czar, ''Peter the Great teaching his Subjects the Art of Shipbuilding''. The last large work which he finished was a second view of the battle of Waterloo, this time from the French side. It was exhibited at [[Westminster Hall]] in 1846, in competition for the decorations of the Houses of Parliament, but was unsuccessful. He visited Germany and France in 1847.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In his final years Sir William lived at 72 Great King Street, a substantial Georgian townhouse over five storeys, in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Bronchitis]] at his Edinburgh home on 23 February 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Tait's Edinburgh Magazine March 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death Sir William was engaged on a large picture of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] against the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the late Victorian extension.

The depiction of '''winter landscapes in [[Western art history|Western art]]''' begins in the 15th century. Wintry and snowy landscapes are not seen in early European painting since most of the subjects were religious. Painters avoided landscapes in general for the same reason. The first depictions of snow began to occur in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"&gt;''Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future'', by David Huddart &amp; Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780470749609}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s that feature snow as a [[theme (arts)|theme]] are mostly [[landscapes]], even if some of these works involve [[religious]] or even [[fantasy]] landscapes. Most of these winter landscapes in art history are [[plein-air]] depictions of winter scenes, using the quality of gray winter light to create the special winter atmosphere.
Depiction of snow in Europe is essentially a northern European theme.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kent | first = Neil | title = Soul of the North: a Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-86189-067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

===Between Renaissance and the eve of Romanticism===
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|thumb|upright|''February'', attributed to [[Limbourg brothers|Paul Limbourg]], or the "Rustic painter", 1412 and 1416, [[Musée Condé]].]]
Early European painters generally did not depict snow since most of their paintings were of religious subjects. The first artistic representations of snow came in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt; Because frequent snowfall is a part of winter in northern European countries, depiction of snow in Europe began first in the northern European countries.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"/&gt;

Since the early 15th century, wintry scenes had been represented by artists in parts of large sculptural works on churches and even on a smaller scale in private devotional scripts such as the [[book of hours]], a devotional collection of texts, [[prayer]]s and [[psalm]]s. These were often [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as ''[[Labours of the Months]],'' a cycle of twelve paintings that illustrated the social life, the agricultural tasks, the weather, and the landscape for each month of the year. January and February were typically shown as snowy, as is ''February'' in the famous cycle of the ''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', illustrated 1412–1416. Some snowy scenes also appear in a set of early 14th-century frescoes created by Master Wenceslas for the Bishop's Palace at Trento, showing people throwing snowballs at each other,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Heine, "The First Time: Innovations in Art", Bucher, Munich, 2007 at 33&lt;/ref&gt; and in a detail of [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Effects of Good Government in the City and Countryside'' (1337–39).&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "The Emergence of the Winter Landscape", Journal of Art in Society,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com/the-emergence-of-the-winter-landscape.html|title="The Emergence of the Winter Landscape",|publisher=www.artinsociety.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjws.blogspot.se/2014/01/illuminated-manuscript-snow.html|title=illuminated-manuscript-snow|publisher=bjws.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, landscapes had not yet developed as a genre in art, which explains the scarcity of winter scenes in medieval painting. Snow was not depicted in art except where it had a context, such as in the winter months of calendars.

During the Early [[Northern Renaissance]] and even more during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th century, interest in landscape painting was increasing. The winter of 1564–1565 was said to be the longest and most severe for more than a hundred years&amp;nbsp;– the beginning of a cold period in northern Europe now called the [[Little Ice Age]]. For the next 150 years, northern European winters were comparatively snowy and harsh. Crop failures, heavy snowfalls and advancing glaciers that consumed Alpine pastures and villages made the era a grim one for European peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english|title=brief-history-snow-britain|publisher=/www.theguardian.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|275px|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565, oil on wood, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]]] 
It was early in the frigid winter of 1565 that Bruegel created ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/hunters-in-the-snow-winter/WgFmzFNNN74nUg?projectId=art-project|title=hunters-in-the-snow-winter|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first true winter landscape painting. It was part of a series that illustrated the months, something thematically similar to the traditional Flemish [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g. the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the snowy ''Hunters'' (December–January), it included ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August). ''The Hunters'' depicts village life in a snowbound Flemish setting, showing not only hunters with pikes trudging off with their dogs to seek game, but also villagers gathered around a fire, frozen ponds with skaters, and houses and churches in the distance&amp;nbsp;– all against a fanciful backdrop of snow-covered mountains. The series was commissioned in 1565 by a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]]. The paintings by Flemish artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were on a larger scale than calendar paintings; they measured approximately three feet by five feet (0.9 by 1.5 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruegel continued to depict snow in his paintings. He created the first nativity scene to include snow, ''[[Adoration of the Magi in a Winter Landscape]]'', which is also the earliest known painting to actually depict falling snow. He also started a vogue for [[Netherlandish]] winter painting. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a now Protestant (Calvinist) society, which preferred non-religious themes such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]], and landscape painting. The tradition of painting landscapes continued well into the 19th century and developed into the [[Romantic painting|Romantic landscape]]. Between 1780 and 1820, following the initial vogue in the 16th century for Netherlandish winter landscapes, winter subjects again become popular. However, this time winter landscapes became popular in their own right, as the beginning of the Romantic movement created a new interest in the landscape. This new interest, combined with the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe, gave landscape painting for its own sake, not simply as a backdrop to a scene or a setting, a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than it had held earlier.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt;

Later, after a relatively warm period that coincided with the end of the 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age]], the European climate turned cool again, heading for a trough whose lowest point was in the second decade of the 19th century. In 1809, a series of major volcanic eruptions heralded the arrival of a particularly cold period as the clouds of ash partially blocked out the sun. The decade from 1810 to 1819 was the coldest in England since the 17th century. In 1812, the French [[Grande Armée]] was forced to retreat from Moscow by the advancing winter&amp;nbsp;– known to the Russians as General Snow. These climactic events played a great part in the development of a new art genre, the winter landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the growing Romantic movement intensified interest in landscape painting, including winter landscapes. Practitioners included the German artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who depicted remote and wild landscapes. Caspar David Friedrich was a romantic landscape painter, and was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes as austere, forbidding and desolate. His winter scenes are solemn and still. They are often painted [[plein-air]], with the artist using the thin, gray light of winter to create an appropriate atmosphere and illustrate the effect of light reflected off snow. According to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which "no man has yet set his foot". Although based on direct observation, his landscapes did not reproduce nature but were painted to create a dramatic effect, using nature as a mirror of human emotions. His aim was a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature, paralleling Romanticism's validation of intense emotions such as apprehension, fear, horror, terror and awe. Awe in particular&amp;nbsp;– experienced when confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– drew Friedrich's interest, as seen in his idealized portrayals of coasts, forests and craggy mountains. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling&amp;nbsp;– ''die romantische Stimmungslandschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] (2005).

Along with other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position [[landscape painting]] as a major genre within Western art. His style influenced his contemporary, the Norwegian [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857), and, later, [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901) and many Russian painters, in particular [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (c. 1842–1910) and [[Ivan Shishkin]] (1832–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Suzanne Latt|title=The Relationship of the American Luminists to Caspar David Friedrich|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|year=1964|oclc=23758262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the 18th-century [[Düsseldorf School]] is characterized by finely detailed but still fanciful landscapes, often portraying religious or allegorical stories. Leading members of the Düsseldorf School advocated [[En plein air|plein-air]] painting and tended to use a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] of relatively subdued and muted colors. The Düsseldorf School grew out of, and was a part of, the [[Germany|German]] [[Romantic movement]]. Prominent members of the Düsselorf School included [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], [[Rudolf Koller]], [[Karl Friedrich Lessing]], [[Johann Wilhelm Schirmer]], [[Andreas Achenbach]], [[Hans Fredrik Gude]], [[Oswald Achenbach]] and [[Adolf Schrödter]].&lt;ref name="humboldt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Humboldt|first=Wilhelm von|title=Gesammelte Schriften. 1.

French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other artists of the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that in the 19th century would become the most influential in Europe.

It is often assumed that [[plein-air]] painting started with the 19th-century [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], but in fact it was already common in the late 18th century when the members of the [[Hudson River School]] of American [[landscape art|landscape]] painters were already painting in plein-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|title=interview|publisher=jamesgurney.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[I really like the work before 1860 the best. People often assume that plein-air painting started with the Impressionists, but it's much older than that, going back to the late 18th Century. The Hudson River School painters, under the influence of Asher B. Durand, were the first to make a regular practice of it, and they often made more sensitive observations than later plein-air painters, because they weren't influenced by the notion of "art for art's sake." Art does not exist for its own sake. The purpose of art is not to make an aesthetically pleasing picture; it should be much more—to tell a story, reveal a character, convey an emotion, or express some truth about nature.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-landscape.blogspot.se/2010/05/what-is-plein-air-painting.html|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=art-landscape.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frederic Edwin Church]], a central figure in the [[Hudson River School]], was known for painting large landscapes that he saw during his travels to the Arctic and Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart/docs/dma_voyageoftheicebergs|title=Voyage of the Icebergs -online book|publisher=/issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Plein-air painting, in its strictest sense, is the practice of painting landscape pictures out-of-doors; more loosely, the achievement of an intense impression of the open air (French: plein air) in a landscape painting. Until the time of the painters of the Barbizon school in mid-19th-century France, it was normal practice to execute rough sketches of landscape subjects in the open air and produce finished paintings in the studio. Part of this was a matter of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464567/plein-air-painting|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Impressionists were the first artists who made plein-air painting a major genre. They painted outdoors and were interested in real-life subject matter. Their most evident preoccupation and interest was capturing the effect of light and weather at a particular moment&amp;nbsp;– they often painted the same theme all over again in different light and different weather. The Impressionists were influenced in many of their subjects by [[Japanese woodblock prints]]. The themes of falling snow and figures with umbrellas in snow are frequent subjects in the [[ukiyo-e]] Japanese woodblock prints.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter-34290|title=boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter|publisher=www.mfa.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturevulture.net/art-architecture/impressionists-in-winter/|title=impressionists-in-winter|publisher=culturevulture.net|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/monets-garden-melbourne-winter-masterpieces-exhibition|title=Monet’s Garden – Melbourne Winter Masterpieces Exhibition|publisher=www.thecultureconcept.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[During the latter half of the nineteenth century (1874 – 1886) many people found it difficult to cope with this new vision. It was all about capturing the moment, the joy of life and revealing many of its secrets or truths.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a series of severe winters in France also contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] started painting large numbers of winter landscapes in which they experimented with the use of light and color to paint what they called the ''effets de neige'' (the effects of snow). Other painters who painted winter landscapes but less frequently were [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. The French master [[Claude Monet]]'s first painting in his winter series of 140 paintings was ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at [[Honfleur]]'', which was followed by many other winter landscapes, including a long series with haystacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/claude-monet-paintings-1889-18948.htm|title=claude-monet-paintings-1889|publisher=entertainment.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting ''Boulevard Saint Denis'', Monet sought to catch the moment when the sun was hidden behind the clouds during a light snowfall.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"/&gt; In ''[[The Magpie (Monet)|The Magpie]]'', Monet's largest and probably most widely known winter painting, he used blue-gray colors to depict shadows in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claude-monet.com/the-magpie.jsp|title=the-magpie|publisher=www.claude-monet.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zucapaca.com/best-of-monet/claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie/|title=claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie|publisher=www.zucapaca.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the natural outdoor light that made the Impressionist's treatment of subjects different. They closely observed the various colors of light that were reflected from objects and captured those colors in their paintings. Since Impressionists painted in ''[[plein air]]'', the shadows reflected the light of the sky as it was reflected onto surfaces.

Impressionists generally used vivid colors, with often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter. The new technology of premixed paints in tin tubes aided the development of this style.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters had made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process]. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1860s, many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available such as [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]] and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], as well as even newer colors such as [[cerulean blue]].&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995).

As a result, the Impressionists soon moved toward a brighter style of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stoner, J.H. |author2=Rushfield, R. |year=2013 |title=Conservation of Easel Paintings |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn=9781136000416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, [[Monet]], [[Renoir]], and [[Pissarro]] usually chose to paint on grounds of a light grey or beige colour, but some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356|title=Impressionists|publisher=/yalepress.yale.edu|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xuan paper''' (''xuanzhi'' {{zh|t=[[wikt:宣紙|宣紙]]|s=[[wikt:宣纸|宣纸]]|p={{linktext|xuānzhǐ}}}}), or '''Shuen paper''' or '''rice paper''', is a kind of [[paper]] originating in ancient [[China]] used for writing and painting. Xuan paper is renowned for being soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both [[Chinese calligraphy]] and painting.

== Origin ==
Xuan paper was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books ''Notes of Past Famous Paintings'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]''. It was originally produced in the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[Jing County, Anhui|Jing County]], which was under the jurisdiction of [[Xuancheng|Xuan Prefecture]] (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of [[hemp]] (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Technology, treatment, and care of a chinese wood block print|author1=Fei Wen Tsai|author2=Dianne van der Reyden|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|p=4|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/RELACT/chinese_prints.pdf}} originally appeared as "Analysis of modern Chinese paper and treatment of a Chinese woodblock print" in ''The Paper Conservator'', 1997, pp. 48-62&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Song dynasty]], the paper producing industries in Huizhou and Chizhou were gradually transferred to Jing County.

== Classification ==
Due to different producing methods, Xuan paper can be classified into ''Shengxuan'', ''Shuxuan'', and ''Banshuxuan''. Shengxuan (literally "Raw Xuan"), which is not specially processed, excels in its ability to absorb water, causing the ink on it to blur. Shuxuan (literally "Ripe Xuan"), however, has [[Potassium alum]] worked into it during production, which results in a stiffer texture, a reduced ability to absorb water, and less resistance to shear stress (meaning that it can be torn much more easily). This feature makes Shuxuan more suitable for [[Gongbi]] rather than Xieyi. Banshuxuan (literally "Half-ripe Xuan") has intermediate absorbability, between Shengxuan and Shuxuan.

== Features ==
Xuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture and clean stroke, great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth and mold. The majority of ancient Chinese books and paintings by famous painters that survived until today are well preserved on Xuan paper. Xuan paper won the Golden Award at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Xuan paper was used to make scrolls.

== Material and production ==
The material Xuan paper uses is closely related to the geography of Jing County. The bark of ''[[Pteroceltis tatarinowii]]'', a common species of [[elm]] in the area, was used as the main material to produce Xuan paper. [[Rice]], along with several other materials, was subsequently added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. [[Bamboo]] and [[mulberry]] also began to be used to produce xuan paper around that time.

The production of Xuan paper can be loosely described as an 18-step process, and a detailed account would involve over a hundred. Some paper makers have invented steps which have been kept secret from others. The process includes steaming and bleaching the bark of ''Pteroceltis tatarinowii'', as well as the addition of a variety of juices.

The work was included in the exhibition "Barbara Kruger: Belief + Doubt" at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, D.C., which has been on view since 2012.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hirshhorn.si.edu/explore/barbara-kruger-beliefdoubt/|title=Barbara Kruger: Belief+Doubt - Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|work=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with much of Kruger's art, ''You Are Not Yourself'' is often interpreted with a [[feminist]] analysis. Critics have discussed the gendered implications of the image, noting that the woman's shattered reflection suggests the existence of women in society is inherently fragmented. Women are held to many standards and forced to adopt conflicting roles only to become an amalgamation of other's expectations and assumptions; when a woman finally has a moment for self-reflection (or, as Kruger suggests, a chance to catch a glance in the mirror) she finds that she is "not herself".&lt;ref name="rain"&gt;Rain&amp;Cupcakes.

Accessed April 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The text itself resembles crudely cut and pasted letters that create a jarring tone and echo the theme of breaking. Some critics interpret the image as a call for viewers to consider their own subjectivity and evaluate the societal messages that they may be receiving.&lt;ref name="rain"/&gt; In 1991 interview, Kruger said: "I would venture to guess that many people heed their mirrors at least five times a day and that vigilance certainly can structure physical and psychic identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=W.J.T.|date=Winter 1991|title=An Interview with Barbara Kruger|url=https://monoskop.org/File:Mitchell_WJT_1991_An_Interview_with_Barbara_Kruger|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=17|pages=434-448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of pronouns in Kruger's work is often discussed as a potential source of meaning. In ''You Are Not Yourself'', questions have been raised about the identity of the subject that Kruger hails: who is the "you" in question? ''You Are Not Yourself'' features a shattered mirror that has been interpreted to symbolize the reflection of each unique viewer, suggesting that the embedded message is directed towards everyone who views the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Trepsa, Katrina.
