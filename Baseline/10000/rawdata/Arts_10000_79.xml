'''''Approaching Thunder Storm''''' is an 1859 painting by American painter [[Martin Johnson Heade]]. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts an approaching thunderstorm. It was his largest painting to date.&lt;ref&gt;Strazdes, 164&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11050|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is praised for its dramatic depiction of the threatening mood of blackening skies and eerily illuminated terrain prior to the storm itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of a series of paintings by Heade of coastal landscapes, this work was based on a sketch that Heade made of an approaching storm on [[Narragansett Bay]], Rhode Island. Here, a fisherman sits by the shore watching the storm approach; there is a faint red bolt of lightning in the left part of the sky. To his left are a dog, an iron kettle, and a spread-out boat sail. Another fisherman is rowing toward the shore, having left his sailboat out on the bay. His placement in the composition helps provide a sense of distance and a narrative for the scene. 

The painting is fairly conventional for its time, but the scene is hardly [[picturesque]]. Strazdes suggests that "Heade, by refusing to prettify his scenery by association, was attempting to inject into his artistic vision a serious, monumental simplicity it had not previously possessed."&lt;ref name="s165"&gt;Strazdes, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is very open, as if seen through a wide-angle lens, and relatively empty. The swathes of dark color are novel for a landscape work. The long horizon is an influence from Heade's contemporary, [[Frederic Edwin Church]], as in paintings such as ''[[Niagara (Frederic Edwin Church)|Niagara]]''.&lt;ref name="s165"/&gt;

[[File:Martin Johnson Heade -Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay ATC.jpg|thumb|Heade, ''Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay'' (1868)]]

Numerous [[pentimenti]] suggest that Heade altered the composition over time; for example, the hills on the horizon were originally larger and more jagged.  Records suggest that ''Approaching Thunder Storm'' was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="s165"/&gt; In 1868, Heade painted ''Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay'', a similar composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">[[File:Arca santa de Oviedo.JPG|thumb|300px|Arca Santa, the front panel]]
The '''Arca Santa''' ("Holy Ark", or chest) is an oak [[reliquary]] covered with silver-gilt decorated in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]]. It is kept in the [[Cámara Santa]] of the [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador]] in [[Oviedo]]. In 1934 the Cámara Santa suffered an explosion that severely damaged the Arca, which was carefully restored by Manuel Gómez-Moreno.

==Description==
The Arca is a black oak box 72 by 119 by 93&amp;nbsp;cm, which is unusually large for a reliquary, more typical of the size of a small portable altar. It was constructed without nails, perhaps in imitation of [[Solomon's Temple]]. The whole is covered in silver: front and both sides are [[repoussé]], the back has a simple checkered pattern, and the flat lid is [[engrave]]d with [[niello]]. Appropriately for its size, the front panel is modelled after an altar front, depicting [[Christ in majesty]] on a [[mandorla]] carried by four angels and flanked by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. The panel is bordered on all sides by a [[Kufesque]] inscription.

The left side is a narrative cycle of [[Christ's infancy]] in five scenes arranged in two registers, read counterclockwise from the top right. The two rows are separated by a band which reads: &lt;small&gt;MARIA ET IOSEP POSUERUNT DOMINUM IN PRESEPIO ANIMALIU / ANGELUS APARUIT IOSEP DICENS FUGE IN EGIPTUM ET ESTO [IBI]&lt;/small&gt; ("Mary and Joseph put the Lord in the animals' manger / An angel appeared to Joseph saying, 'Flee into Egypt, and stay [there]"). The right side is also divided into two registers separated by a band of text. The top depicts Christ in a mandorla supported by two angels on the left and on the right [[Michael the Archangel]], flanked by a [[cherub]] and a [[seraph]], battling a dragon. The bottom row shows eight apostles in various poses, all apparently speaking. The band reads: &lt;small&gt;ASCENDENS XPS IN ALTUM CAPTIVAM DUXIT CAPTIVITATE / MICAEL ARCANGELUS PUGNAVIT CUM DRACONE&lt;/small&gt; ("Ascending on high, Christ led the captive from captivity / Michael the Archangel fought with the dragon").

The lid bears a detailed portrayal of [[Christ's crucifixion]], including the two thieves, the Virgin Mary, the "disciple whom Jesus loved" (John), angels with [[censer]]s, and personifications of the sun and moon. Surrounding the scene there is a long inscription.

==Contents==
Unusually for reliquaries of the Early Middle Ages, the Arca contained the relics of several saints. The most precious were a piece of the [[True Cross]], pieces from the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Sepulchre]], some bread from the [[Last Supper]], and some of the Virgin's milk. There was also a crystalline [[ampulla]] containing some blood from the [[Berytus icon]], an image of Christ first reported at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 to have emitted blood after it had been pierced by some Jews. The reported contents of the Arca Santa "reflect interest in the humanity of Christ, the Holy Family, and the Holy Land itself".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides relics of the Holy Family, the [[Old Testament]] was represented in the Arca by the rod of [[Moses]] and some [[manna]]. Many relics of the apostles were contained in it, as well as the cloak which the Virgin reportedly gave to [[Ildephonsus of Toledo]].

The earliest recorded description of the Arca's contents is a notice added to an eleventh-century codex of [[Valenciennes]]&lt;ref&gt;Valenciennes, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This notice may have been based on a guide prepared by some clerks of the church of Oviedo. The lid of the Arca also contains a partial list of contents in silver repoussé. Another contemporary source for the contents of the Arca is a letter of [[Osmond (Bishop of Astorga)|Osmond]], [[Bishop of Astorga]], addressed to [[Ida of Lorraine|Ida of Boulogne]], about the Marian relics one could see in Spain.

===Sudarium of Oviedo===
{{further|Sudarium of Oviedo}}
The [[Sudarium of Oviedo]], or '''Shroud of Oviedo''', also '''cloth of Oviedo''', is the most notable relic of Christ's passion kept in the Arca Santa reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Janice |title=Sacred Blood, Sacred Image: The Sudarium of Oviedo, New Evidence for the Authenticity of the Shroud of Turin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKk2cU_-Q8UC |accessdate=21 October 2010 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=978-0-9705682-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodstained cloth or ''sudarium'' (Latin for sweat cloth) is reputed to be the cloth wrapped around the head of Jesus Christ after he died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudariumchristi.com/uk/tomb/compare.htm Byssus and pure linen – Comparing the cloths] Multimedia comparison of the cloth of Oviedo and the sudarium of Manoppello, Texts: Blandina Paschalis Schlömer&lt;/ref&gt; There are notable congruencies with a number of related [[acheiropoieta]] images such as those of the [[Shroud of Turin|Turin]] and [[Manoppello Image|Manoppello]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epACTwQuxgE&amp;list=SPF32FC9003C098D97 The Rediscovered Face - 1] first of four installments of an audiovisual presentation relating the holy image with a number of ancient predecessors, YouTube, access date March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] is displayed to the public three times a year: [[Good Friday]], the [[Exaltation of the Holy Cross|Feast of the Triumph of the Cross]] on 14 September, and its octave on 21 September.

==Origins==

===Legend===
Legends concerning the origins of the Arca Santa spread widely in the Middle Ages, and can be found in no less than ten sources between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries. In the ''[[Liber testamentorum]]'', composed around 1120 to record all the gifts and privileges received by the diocese of Oviedo, some disciples of the twelve apostles are given credit for constructing the Arca in [[Jerusalem]], where it is said to have remained until [[Chosroes II]] conquered the city in 614. At that time it was moved to Africa. The [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic invasion]] forced its removal to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], at that time the capital of the [[Visigoths]]. When the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslims invaded Spain]]—as a result of the Visigothic kings' sins, according to the ''Liber''—in 711 the Arca was brought to Oviedo for safekeeping. Finally, in the early ninth century [[Alfonso II of Asturias]] constructed a chapel dedicated to Saint Michael (the Cámara Santa) to house it. In this chapel, now an annex of the cathedral of Oviedo, it remains to this day. A similar account of the translation is included in the ''[[Liber chronicorum]]'', a historical companion piece to the ''Liber testamentorum''. This in turn influenced accounts in the ''[[Historia silense]]'', the ''[[Chronicon mundi]]'', and ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]''. Two biographies of [[Toribius of Astorga]], the ''Estoria de sancto Toribio'' and the ''Vida de santo Toribio de Liébana'', though they differ on many points, agree that Toribius took refuge in Spain with some relics from Jerusalem, where he had been guarding them, safely hidden in a wooden ark.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Fernández González, [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02122952/articulos/DICE9999110029A.PDF "Vidas y dichos de Santo Toribio de Liébana conservados en el monasterio que lleva su nombre"], ''Dicenda: Cuadernos de Filología Hispánica'', '''17''' (1999), 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Estoria'' presents a long list of items stored away in the Arca, the ''Vida'' mentions only a piece of wood from the True Cross and a jar which held the [[Wedding at Cana|wine of Jesus' first miracle at Cana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''E en cabo de los tres años aparescióle otra vez el ángel de Dios e díxole:&lt;br&gt;
''— Turibio, lleva las reliquias a las partidas de España ca sepas que toda esta tierra a de seer destruyda de moros.&lt;br&gt;
''E santo Turibio fizo luego assí e puso las reliquias en la barca, entre las quales traxo primeramente un pedaço de la cruz donde fue crucificado el nuestro salvador Jhesu Christo, e una tinaja de las en que consagró del agua vino e de otras muchas reliquias de santos e santas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And at the end of the three years the angel of God appeared to him again and said to him: "Turibius, carry the relics to the parts of Spain because you know that all this land must be destroyed by the Moors." And Saint Turibius then did thus and put the relics&lt;ref&gt;The relics were already in an ''arca'' by then.&lt;/ref&gt; on the ship, among which were firstly a piece of the cross where our saviour Jesus Christ was crucified, and one of the jars in which he consecrated the water wine, and many other relics of saints men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===
Traditionally, historians have credited the adornment of the Arca and the Cámara to [[Alfonso VI of León]] and his sister [[Urraca of Zamora]] and dated it to 1075. On 13 March that year, according to Document 72 of the cathedral archives of Oviedo, Alfonso and Urraca had the reliquary opened in their presence and examined the contents. This document, dated 14 March, survives only in a thirteenth-century copy, and its authenticity has been questioned. It may have been produced to bolster the claims of Oviedo and its shrine against those of Santiago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10451">'''Arts Midwest''', headquartered in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], is one of six [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] [[Regional arts council (RAO)|regional arts organization]]s created to “encourage development of the arts and to support arts programs on a regional basis.”&lt;ref&gt;US Regional Arts Organizations. http://www.usregionalarts.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts Midwest's mission is to "promote creativity, nurture cultural leadership, and engage people in meaningful arts experiences, bringing vitality to Midwest communities and enriching people’s lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Arts Midwest. http://www.artsmidwest.org&lt;/ref&gt; Arts Midwest is primarily funded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA), and is charged with supporting artists and arts organizations, and providing assistance to its nine member states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wisconsin]].

==History==

Regional arts programs first emerged in the late 1960s in response to a need for greater access to performing arts touring in areas isolated from major cultural centers. The development of RAOs was encouraged in 1973 by the NEA House reauthorizing committee, which stated its belief that:

:''Cooperation among states in their activities to support the arts can significantly serve the purposes of this act… It is felt that the regional approach would better serve the cultural needs of the people in many areas by allowing the full utilization of the resources of several states to be brought to bear where special needs exist.''&lt;ref&gt;US Regional Arts Organizations, ''History.'' {{cite web|url=http://www.usregionalarts.org/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711093307/http://www.usregionalarts.org/history.htm |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation creating RAOs was introduced by Public Law 93-133.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress (1973). ''National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Amendments,'' The Library of Congress. http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d093:SN00795:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1973, the [[United States Congress]] has set aside a specific appropriation within the NEA budget for the states and their regional organizations. The RAOs, which include Arts Midwest, [[Mid-America Arts Alliance]], [[Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation]], the [[New England Foundation for the Arts]], [[Southern Arts Federation|South Arts]], and the [[Western States Arts Federation]], use this funding to coordinate the touring and presenting of visual and performing arts programs in the United States. 

Arts Midwest was formed in 1985 through the merger of two RAOs, the Affiliated State Arts Agencies of the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes Arts Alliance. It is supported by the NEA’s appropriation, as well as private support in the forms of individual gifts, corporate and foundation grants, and dues paid by member State Arts Agencies.

==Programs==

'''Arts Midwest manages several national initiatives for the National Endowment for the Arts:'''

:*'''[[The Big Read]]''' is an program of the NEA managed by Arts Midwest. It was created in response to ''Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America'',&lt;ref&gt;National Endowment for the Arts (2004). ''Reading At Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America.'' Research Division Report #46. {{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov/pub/readingatrisk.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527173632/http://www.arts.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a report issued in July 2004 by the NEA that identified issues facing literary reading. The mission of the Big Read is “to bring together partners across the country to encourage citizens to read for pleasure and enlightenment.”&lt;ref&gt;National Endowment for the Arts. The Big Read. http://www.neabigread.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Shakespeare in American Communities''' supports professional theatrical productions of [[William Shakespeare]] for middle and high school students by annually providing grants to professional theater companies.

:*'''NEA Jazz Masters Live''' supports programs that feature and honor [[NEA Jazz Masters]]. The initiative aims to introduce audiences to the genre of [[Jazz|American Jazz]] and its musicians.

==Past Programs==

In 2009, Arts Midwest worked in collaboration with its partner Regional Arts Organizations on '''''Global Positioning Strategy for the Arts: Recommitting America to International Cultural Exchange,'''''&lt;ref&gt;US Regional Arts Organizations (2009). ''Global Positioning Strategy for the Arts: Recommitting America to International Cultural Exchange.'' http://www.artsmidwest.org/files/GPS_for_the_Arts_Web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a report that outlines a set of policy recommendations for the [[Obama Administration]] on increasing investment in and capacity for international cultural exchange.

From 2008-2010, Arts Midwest coordinated an international component of The Big Read, The Big Read Egypt/U.S. The Big Read Egypt/U.S. was a Global Cultural Initiative project of the U.S. Department of State and the NEA in partnership with Arts Midwest, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The program introduced communities in Egypt to American literature: '[[Fahrenheit 451|Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury)'']],'[[To Kill a Mockingbird|'To Kill A Mockingbird (Harper Lee),'']] and '[[The Grapes of Wrath|'The Grapes of Wrath (John Steinbeck),'']] and has exposed US communities to Egyptian author '[[The Thief and the Dogs|'Naguib Mahfouz’s The Thief and the Dogs.'']]

Arts Midwest partnered with the [[Ohio Arts Council]] and the [[Columbus Museum of Art]] in 2000 to tour '''''Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland.''''' This exhibition focused on the [[American Midwest]] and included approximately 100 paintings and photographs created during the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. These works surrounded four large-scale sculptural projects created by contemporary artists [[Maya Lin]], [[Mary Lucier]], [[Kerry James Marshall]],  and Malcolm Cochran. ''Illusions of Eden'' was organized around the themes of garden, home, work, word, and journey.

In 2002, Arts Midwest partnered with the Ludwig Museum in Budapest on '''''The View from Here: Recent Pictures from Central Europe and the American Midwest''''', an exhibition that explored regional identity as envisioned by artists from the American Midwest and [[Central Europe]]. Four themes shaped ''The View from Here'': natural landscape, built or constructed environments, social commentaries gleaned through the artists’ observations and experiences, and reflections on cultural values. 

Arts Midwest partnered with The Decorative Arts Center of Ohio in 2006 on the exhibition '''''Russel Wright: Living with Good Design.''''' The exhibition featured American designer [[Russel Wright|Russel Wright’s]] designs for housewares, furniture, appliances, and fabrics from the 1930s to the late 1950s. 

In 2009, Arts Midwest and the Columbus Museum of Art organized '''''Stories of the Somali Diaspora: Photographs by Abdi Roble'''''. This exhibition consists of 55 black and white images documenting [[Somali people|Somali]] immigrants as they adjust to living in the United States. The exhibition is part of ''The Somali Documentary Project'', a larger documentary initiative by the artist.

'''Carlo Pittara''' (1836, [[Turin]] - 25 October 1891, [[Rivara]]) was an Italian painter who specialized in animals, pastoral landscapes, rivers and peasants at work. He was also the leader of what came to be known as the {{ill|Scuola di Rivara|it}}. 

==Biography==
He began his studies at the [[Accademia Albertina]], where he worked with the landscape painter [[Giuseppe Camino]]. In 1856, he moved to [[Geneva]] and studied with Charles Humbert (1813–1881), who specialized in animal paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/rivaraonline/Scuola_di_Rivara/Pittara.htm Brief biography] @ Rivara Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1858 to 1860, he lived in Paris, where he became familiar with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] and [[Charles Jacque]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-pittara/ Biographical notes] @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also came under the influence of the [[Barbizon school]]. After that, he spent three years in Rome. Later, he became the leader of a group of landscape painters who met during the summers near 
Rivara, in the [[Canavese]] to paint "[[Plein aire|en plein aire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnam.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/354/carlo-pittara Biographical notes] @ the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna.&lt;/ref&gt; This group consisted of artists who worked in both the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Realism (art)|Realistic]] styles, including [[Ernesto Bertea]], [[Alberto Issel]], [[Serafín Avendaño]], [[Ernesto Rayper]] and [[Federigo Pastoris]]: referred to as the "Scuola di Rivara". Some were also members of a group known as the "{{ill|Scuola grigia|it}}", centered in [[Liguria]].

During the last ten years of his life, he spent the winters in Paris, where his work began to take on [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] overtones. After his death, [[Telemaco Signorini]] questioned his role in establishing the Scuola di Rivara, suggesting that Rayper was actually the focus of the group's inspiration.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Pittara was, in fact, largely forgotten until 1947, when the "Galleria Fogliato" in Turin presented 88 of his canvases.

In [[phonaesthetics]], the [[English compound]] [[noun]] '''''cellar door''''' has been cited as an example of a word or phrase which is beautiful purely in terms of its sound ([[euphony]]), without regard for [[semantics]] (i.e., meaning).&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt; It has been variously presented either as merely one beautiful instance of many, or as the most beautiful in the [[English language]]; as the author's personal choice, that of an eminent scholar's, or of a foreigner who does not speak the language.&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numberg"/&gt; The original instance of this observation has not been discovered, although it was made as early as 1903.

==Meaning and aesthetic qualities==

In the United States, houses are often built with a [[door]] or pair of shutters between the outside of a building and its [[Basement|cellar]]. In Britain, Ireland and Canada, a cellar door is often located within a house and opens onto a flight of [[stairs]] leading to the cellar. Outside doors are more common to pubs and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

From the nineteenth century, many American houses on large plots had slanted [[trapdoor]]s abutting the side and opening onto a flight of steps leading down into the cellar. By the mid-twentieth century this rustic feature was a rarity; in 1953, [[William Chapman White]] wrote in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'':

{{quote|The modern small home or apartment has ... deprived today's child of ... the pleasant summer afternoon activity of sliding down cellar doors. Just what happened to the slanted cellar door in this efficient age isn't clear; although cellars have remained, nothing has disappeared more quietly from modern life than these cellar doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eT4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cellar-door%20slide%20down%20childhood&amp;pg=3182%2C3463962|title=The Lost Art of Bannister Sliding|last=White|first=William Chapman |date=20 April 1953|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=52|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] suggests the use of such a semantically banal term to illustrate the idea of beauty appeals to [[aesthete]]s as "an occasion to display a capacity to discern beauty in the names of prosaic things".&lt;ref name="numberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2142|title=The Romantic Side of Familiar Words|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|date=26 February 2010|work=[[Language Log]]|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Jacques Barzun]] wrote:

{{quote|I discovered its illusory character when many years ago a Japanese friend with whom I often discussed literature told me that to him and some of his English-speaking friends the most beautiful word in our language was 'cellardoor'. It was not beautiful to me and I wondered where its evocative power lay for the Japanese. Was it because they find l and r difficult to pronounce, and the word thus acquires remoteness and enchantment? I asked, and learned also that Tatsuo Sakuma, my friend, had never seen an American cellar door, either inside a house or outside&amp;nbsp;— the usual two flaps on a sloping ledge. No doubt that lack of visual familiarity added to the word’s appeal. He also enjoyed going to restaurants and hearing the waiter ask if he would like salad or roast vegetables, because again the phrase 'salad or' could be heard. I concluded that its charmlessness to speakers of English lay simply in its meaning. It has the l and r sounds and d and long o dear to the analysts of verse music, but it is prosaic. Compare it with 'celandine', where the image of the flower at once makes the sound lovely.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''An Essay on French Verse for Readers of English Poetry'' (New Directions, 1991).  {{ISBN|0-8112-1157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Use in literature==
{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2017}}

Author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] is often given credit for the idea that ''cellar door'' is an especially beautiful phrase.{{refn|name=barrett}}{{efn|In a 1966 interview, Tolkien said: "Supposing you say some quite ordinary words to me{{emdash}}'cellar door', say. From that, I might think of a name 'Selador', and from that a character, a situation begins to grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zaleski  |first1=Philip |last2=Zaleski |first2=Carol |title=The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings: J.R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Farrar Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-15409-7 |page=25  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhToCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=cellar+door |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} An excerpt from Tolkien's 1955 lecture "[[English and Welsh]]" reads in part: 

{{quote|Most English-speaking people ... will admit that ''cellar door'' is 'beautiful', especially if dissociated from its sense (and from its spelling). More beautiful than, say, ''sky'', and far more beautiful than ''beautiful''. Well then, in [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] for me ''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent, and moving to the higher dimension, the words in which there is pleasure in the contemplation of the association of form and sense are abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tolkien|first1=J. R. R.|title=Angles and Britons|date=1964|publisher=University of Wales Press|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlkZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Welsh+cellar+doors|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, an earlier instance can be found in the 1903 novel ''Gee-Boy'' by the Shakespeare scholar Cyrus Lauron Hooper:

{{quote|He was laughed at by a friend, but logic was his as well as sentiment; an Italian savant maintained that the most beautiful combination of English sounds was cellar-door; no association of ideas here to help out! sensuous impression merely! the cellar-door is purely American.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html |title=On Language: Cellar Door |last=Barrett |first=Grant |date=14 February 2010 |work=New York Times Magazine |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Dean Howells]] in the March 1905 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' attributes to a "courtly Spaniard" the quote, "Your language too has soft and beautiful words, but they are not always appreciated. What could be more musical than your word ''cellar-door''?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howells|first=William Dean|date=March 1905|title=Editor's easy chair|journal=Harper's Magazine|page=645|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1905/03/page/0163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Geoff Nunberg speculated that the choice of ''cellar door'' might have arisen from [[Philip Wingate]] and [[Henry W. Petrie]]'s 1894 hit song "I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard", which contains the lyric, "You'll be sorry when you see me sliding down our cellar door", after which "'slide down my cellar door' became a kind of catchphrase to suggest innocent friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=11136|title=Slide down my cellar door|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|date=16 March 2014|work=Language Log|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nunberg identifies "Playmates" as an earlier song from which "I Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard" was derived; in fact the derivation is the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=11136#comment-578872|title=GN response to comment by "Emma"|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|date=17 March 2014|work=Language Log|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/words-to-playmates-song-stir-up-controversy/article/2272570|title=Words to "Playmates" Song Stir Up Controversy|last=Lovelace|first=Melba|date=15 July 1989|work=News OK|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A story told by syndicated columnists Frank Colby in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Take My Word For It |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eZ4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4752%2C1357975 |last=Colby |first=Frank |date=3 November 1949|work=Miami Daily News|page=45|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[L. M. Boyd]] in 1979 holds that ''cellar door'' was [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s favorite phrase, and that the refrain ''Nevermore'' in "[[The Raven]]" was chosen as "the closest word to 'cellar door' he could think of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a90hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cellar-door%20english%20word&amp;pg=3537%2C2682286|title=Quoth the raven "cellar door"?|last=Boyd|first=Louis M.|date=15 January 1979|work=Reading Eagle |page=5|accessdate=27 February 2010|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may derive from a 1914 essay by [[Alma Blount]]:

{{quote|Poe, who studied sound effects carefully, says that he chose 'Nevermore' as the refrain for ''The Raven'' largely because the word contains the [[sonority hierarchy|most sonorous]] vowel, ''o'', and the most 'producible' consonant, ''r''. An amusing story is told of an Italian lady who knew not a word of English, but who, when she heard the word ''cellar-door'', was convinced that English must be a most musical language. If the word were not in our minds hopelessly attached to a humble significance, we, too, might be charmed by its combination of [[spirant]], liquids, and vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive Studies in English Literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|date=January 1914 |pages=30–31|chapter=III: Melody and Harmony |url=https://archive.org/stream/intensivestudies00blourich#page/n59/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1919, with [[Prohibition in the United States]] about to come into force, ''Cartoons'' magazine jocularly invoked the idea when predicting the rise of [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] hidden in basements:

The rhythmic or musical quality of the phrase was referenced by [[H. L.

{{quote|Three poets who were questioned as to their preferences agreed that the measure of a word and its associations are far more important in judging its beauty than the mere sound ...Although Baltimore writers showed wide disagreement in their preferences, none could make out why [writers] in New York think 'cellar-door' should be ranked at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Francis Scott |title=Conversations with F.

The teenage protagonist of [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Why Are We in Vietnam?]]'' attributes the observation to "a committee of Language Hump-type professors ... back in 1936 ".&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt;  [[Richard Lederer]] in ''Crazy English'' claims that H.

In the 2001 film ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', the phrase ''cellar door'' is discussed in one scene, and an actual cellar door figures into the plot in a later scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kois|first=Dan|date=23 July 2003|title=Everything you were afraid to ask about "Donnie Darko"|journal=Slate|url=http://www.salon.com/2004/07/23/darko/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remark is attributed to "a famous linguist" in the dialogue script of the film.

==Alternative spellings==

Some proper names have used alternative spellings of ''cellar door'' that preserve the sound of the phrase without the original meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Columnist Maxine Martz wrote in 1988 about one Margaret Masters, who heard about ''cellar door'' at [[Drake University]], and later named her baby sister ''Sellador''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Yt80AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NIQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6749,4494416&amp;dq=cellar-door+english+word&amp;hl=en|title=A spit-and-polish event (in more ways than one)|last=Martz|first=Maxine|date=11 March 1986|work=The Deseret News|page=14|accessdate=27 February 2010|location=Salt Lake City}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C.

{{Christian culture}}

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

'''Christian music''' is [[music]] that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding [[Christianity|Christian]] life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or with a positive message as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

== Worship services ==
{{Main|Church music}}

[[File:Kirchenchor.gif|thumbnail|left|A church [[choir]] singing]]

Among the most prevalent uses of Christian music are in church worship or other gatherings. Most Christian music involves singing, whether by the whole congregation (assembly), or by a specialized subgroup—such as a soloist, duet, trio, quartet, madrigal, [[choir]], or [[Contemporary worship#Worship band|worship band]]— [[responsory|or both]]. It is frequently accompanied by instruments, but some denominations (such as some [[Exclusive Brethren]], the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Primitive Baptists]] and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)|Free Church of Scotland]]) or congregations still prefer unaccompanied or ''[[a cappella]]'' singing. Some groups, such as the Bruderhof, sing songs both with religious and non-religious meanings and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/bruderhof|title=Bruderhof Communities|website=SoundCloud|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the act of singing is important. One of the earliest forms of worship music in the church was the [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], while not the inventor of chant, was acknowledged as the first person to order such music in the church, hinting the name "Gregorian" chant. The chant reform took place around 590–604 CE (reign of Pope Gregory I) (Kamien, pg. 65–67). The Gregorian chant was known for its very [[monophony|monophonic]] sound. Believing that complexity had a tendency to create [[cacophony]], which ruined the music, Gregory I kept things very simple with the chant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 9th ed. New York, New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumental accompaniment ===
[[File:Ninth Symphony original.png|thumb|A page (leaf 12 [[recto]]) from Beethoven's manuscript. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the West, the majority of Christian denominations use instruments such as an organ, piano, electronic keyboard, guitar, or other accompaniment, and occasionally by a band or orchestra, to accompany the singing. But some churches have historically not used instruments, citing their absence from the New Testament. During the last century or so several of these groups have revised this stance.

The singing of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] is also generally unaccompanied, though in the United States organs are sometimes used as a result of Western influence.

=== Instrumental music ===

Some worship music may be unsung, simply instrumental. During the [[Baroque]] period in Europe, the [[chorale prelude]] (for organ) was widely used, generally composed by using a popular hymn tune thematically, and a wide corpus of other solo organ music began to develop across Europe. Some of the most well-known exponents of such organ compositions include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[François Couperin]], [[César Franck]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]] to name a few. Up to the present time, various composers have written instrumental (often [[organ (music)|organ]]) music as acts of worship, including well known organ repertoire by composers like [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Maurice Duruflé]], and [[Jean Langlais]].

The [[church sonata]] (for orchestra and chamber group) and other sacred instrumental musical forms also developed from the [[Baroque]] period onwards.

== Contemporary Christian music ==
{{Main|Contemporary Christian music}}

From the latter half of the 20th century to the present day in Western Christendom—especially in the United States and in other countries with evangelical churches—various genres of music originally often related to [[pop rock]], have been created under the label of Contemporary Christian Music ("CCM") for home-listening and concert use. It can be divided into several genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. These genres (sometimes referred to as "style") like other forms of music may be distinguished by the techniques, the styles, the context and the themes, or geographical origin. Specific subgenres of CCM may include (but are not limited to): [[Christian country music]], [[Christian pop]], [[Christian rock]], [[Christian metal]], [[Christian hardcore]], [[Christian punk]], [[Christian alternative rock]] and [[Christian hip hop]].

Called Christian pop or gospel in a generalized form, this is a relatively new musical movement and has now evolved into a large number of musical genres by region that comes in a Christian context. This movement appeared as a form of [[evangelization]] for the young but the genre is best known and seen in the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] proselytizing movements, often using rhythms similar to those in secular music.

CCM is not a musical genre like the other genres. When a song is identified as "Christian" it takes into account the lyrics and the songwriters and performers, rather than musical style. Therefore, one can say that CCM is diverse and there are Christian songs that are sung to the rhythm of salsa, reggae, rock, folk, hip-hop or rap, ballads, pop, country, singer-songwriters and even extreme music such as punk or heavy metal.

In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music played a significant role in [[Evangelical]] [[Christian worship]].&lt;ref&gt; Suzel Ana Reily, Jonathan M. Dueck, ''The Oxford Handbook of Music and World Christianities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2016, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Mathew Guest, ''Evangelical Identity and Contemporary Culture: A Congregational Study in Innovation'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of musical styles has developed traditional praise.&lt;ref&gt; George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other languages ===

Similar developments took place in other language, for example the German [[Neues Geistliches Lied]] and [[Korean Contemporary Christian music]].

=== Industry ===
{{Main|Christian music industry}}

Christian music is supported by a segment of the general music industry which evolved as a parallel structure to the same. Beginning in the 1970s and developing out of the [[Jesus movement]], the [[Christian music industry]] subsequently developed into a near-billion dollar enterprise. By the 1990s the genre had eclipsed classical, jazz, and [[new-age music]], and artists began gaining acceptance in the general market.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Christian media}}

Today, Christian music is available through most available media. Christian music is broadcast over the radio, television, or the Internet. Christian Albums and video recordings ([[CD]], [[LP album|LP]], [[music download|digital download]], [[DVD]], etc.) have been increasingly more popular and have continued to increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/27/obituaries.mainsection |title=Obituary: Larry Norman &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2008-02-27|accessdate=2011-09-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Musicals is another growing area, especially with the help of the internet. Church drama groups frequently enjoy performing musical dramas which can be downloaded on-line for free use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Musicals|url=http://www.christianmusicals.co.za|publisher=Gospel Musicals|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music festivals and conferences ===
{{Main|Christian music festival}}

In the US several Christian [[music festivals]] have been organized. They are common in the summertime and draw many different people, specifically those from organized groups such as church [[youth groups]] and campus groups. In addition to music festivals like those that are part of the [[Christian Festival Association]], there are also many Christian [[Academic conference|conferences]] which focus more on speakers, but usually also have musical performances, especially for a [[Worship service]].

The [[Ichthus Music Festival]] started in 1970. Today festivals are held annually around the world, and may draw upwards of 100,000 people.

New Zealand's [[Parachute Music Festival]], the largest Christian music festival in the Southern Hemisphere, began in 1989 and is held annually at Mystery Creek Events Centre outside the city of Hamilton.

England's [[Big Church Day Out Festival]] began in 2009 and has annual attendance of approximately 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Church Day Out|url=http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|publisher=Big Church Day Out|accessdate=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815042528/http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|archive-date=15 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerts ===

Like any musical group or act, many Christian musical artists perform concerts in [[concert halls]], bars &amp; clubs, or outdoor venues, as well as in Church-related venues. Sometimes it may be for pure entertainment, other times with the intention of [[evangelism|witnessing]] (evangelizing by bearing witness of one's faith), and other times may be part [[contemporary worship|worship]] as well.

The '''Church of Saint Peter the Apostle''' is a [[Catholic]] Church in [[Alcamo]] in the [[province of Trapani]].

Adjoining it there is the ''Orfanotrofio Femminile di San Pietro''.

== Historical hints ==
This church is one of the oldest ones in Alcamo, as it is proved by a document dating back to 1367. Annexed to a female [[Orphanage]] in 1631, it was rebuilt during the years 1645–1649 at the expense of Francesco Graffeo, a priest, and was widened in 1742 after the design of the architect [[Giovanni Biagio Amico]] and with an elegant series of [[stucco]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof, fallen down owing to the [[1968 Belice earthquake]], was reconstructed about 20 years ago; thanks to the financing of 300&amp;nbsp;millions liras and the zeal of its president Mario Adamo, the [[Office of Works]] (Genio civile) put out on contract for the works of restoration and consolidation. Then they repaired the roofing to avoid any further damage due to bad weather.&lt;ref name="alpauno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-la-chiesa-di-san-pietro-riapre-le-porte/#.V82FW62s9Z8|publisher=alpauno.com|title=Alcamo-La chiesa di San Pietro riapre le porte |accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately the surviving decorations have been damaged by the years of exposure to atmospheric agents.
The interior is not integral altogether, but now it is important that it has been safeguarded.&lt;ref name="giornatefai2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giornatefai.it/luoghi/87338|publisher=giornatefai.it|title=Giornate FAI di Primavera 2016 &amp;#124; Tutti i luoghi aperti|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benedectine Nuns ==
According to the assertion by the [[Benedictine]] Father Pietro Antonio Tornamira, in one of his works dating back to 1664, a group of [[Oblate]] [[Benedictine Nuns]] of the Third Order administrated  "the House of the Young Girls of Saint Peter.

Since 1631, very probably these Nuns, besides charitable actions, devoted themselves to the education of the girls sheltered in the Orphanage, and also made some [[handicrafts]] ([[weaving]], [[sewing]], mending and [[embroidery]]) earning their livings from the proceeds. .&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.227, Alcamo, Campo, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Even after 1866, when the institution passed to the local [[municipality]], they continues these activities

Today these premises are run by IPAB (Public Institution of Assistance and Charity: Opere Pie Pastore and San Pietro) and the activities connexed with hospitalty and education of poor children are carried on.

== Description and works ==
The 1649 main portal is remarkable for its artistic beauty.
In the Church, which was with one nave, there were these five altars:
*[[Saint Peter]], a 17th century valuable painting, on the high altar
On the side altars there were placed the following paintings:
* [[saint Rosalia]]
* Our Lady with [[Saint Benedict]].
* [[Our Lady of Sorrows]]
* [[Jesus]]’ birth, a painting

The group of works that today are hosted at the [[Sacred Art Museum]] inside the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption]];  among these there is also a painting which represents Saint Peter and another one with Saint Rosalia, probable works of one of [[Pietro Novelli]]’ pupils.&lt;ref name="giornatefai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giornatefai.it/luoghi/87338|publisher=giornatefai.it|title=FAI - Browser non supportato|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[maiolica]] floor and the [[tombstone]] of the priest Vincenzo Graffeo are still kept in a good and unusual state of preservation.

'''ComicBase''' is a [[computer program]] for tracking [[comic book]] collections. It was created in 1992&lt;ref name="Company Information"&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/company_information.aspx Company Information]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Peter Bickford]] as an [[Apple Macintosh]] program. A Windows version was introduced in 1996. As of February 2015, it is on its nineteenth version (dubbed ComicBase 2017) and is available for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] Windows 7, and later. Its database includes pricing and notes on over 800,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/products/products.aspx ComicBase Product Features]&lt;/ref&gt; individual comic book issues, and allows users to sell their comics online at a website marketplace called Atomic Avenue.

ComicBase 2017 includes a "My Comics" web app which uses works in conjunction with the desktop software to allow users to view and update their collections on virtually any mobile device through the use of [[responsive design]] techniques, including Apple, Windows, and Android smartphones and tablets, as well as devices like the PSP and Kindle. This feature was introduced with ComicBase 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New in ComicBase 2015|url=http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/Products/WhatsNew.aspx|website=www.comicbase.com|publisher=Human Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases can be recorded in the mobile web app either by entering in the comics title and issue, or by taking a picture of the comic's barcode using a mobile device's camera.

ComicBase was the first software available on [[Blu-ray disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.gizmodo.com/2006/07/12/comicbase_11_first_bluray_soft.html| title=Gizmodo UK : ComicBase 11: First Blu-ray Software| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708034457/http://uk.gizmodo.com/2006/07/12/comicbase_11_first_bluray_soft.html| archivedate=2007-07-08| deadurl=yes| accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts''' contains a comprehensive collection of books, periodicals, reports, and other materials on the bookselling and publishing industries.  Scholars have called it "an important [collection] that aids our understanding of the book trade as a profession."

Prior to  1989, much of the collection was housed in the Graduate Library of the City University of New York.  Currently, the collection is housed at the [[New York Center for Independent Publishing]], which is, itself, a part of the venerable General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York.

The Library's holdings include approximately 3,000 volumes on all aspects of the industry. Contained in the collection are published works (many out-of-print) on such topics as bookselling; book design and production; trade, scholarly and children's book publishing; 
author/publisher relations; [[book collecting]]; censorship; and a wealth of biographies of luminaries of the book trade.

The Library was endowed by [[William H. Crouse]], a successful technical writer for General Motors and McGraw-Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/06/books/publishing-a-gold-mine-for-technical-writers.html|title=PUBLISHING: A GOLD MINE FOR TECHNICAL WRITERS|last=Mcdowell|first=Edwin|date=1983-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Guy Rose - The Blue Kimono.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guy Rose]]. ''The Blue Kimono''. His work has been termed Decorative Impressionism.]]

'''Decorative Impressionism''' is an art historical term that is credited to the art writer Christian Brinton, who first used it in 1911{{where|date=May 2016}}. Brinton titled an article on the American expatriate painter [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], one of the members of the famous Giverny Colony of American Impressionists, "The Decorative Impressionist."

However, use of the term has been revived in recent decades by the influential and prolific art historian [[William H. Gerdts]] to describe the figurative works of not only Frieseke, but some of his Giverny compatriots including [[Richard E. Miller]], [[Louis Ritman]] and Robert Reid. The same term has been applied to other Giverny school painters who painted the figure including [[Guy Rose]], [[Karl Anderson (artist)|Karl Anderson]] and [[Karl Albert Buehr]]. Decorative Impressionism describes a way of painting the human figure that attempts to reconcile academic techniques with Impressionist and Post-Impressionist influences.

The works of these artists tend to be either high-key outdoor depictions of women in languid poses, or interior scenes with the figures illuminated by natural light from windows. Many of these highly decorative paintings have a recognizable influence from Japanese art or [[Japonisme]], with the strong use of patterns in the backgrounds. The work of the originators of first Decorative Impressionists was popular from about 1905 until the mid-1920s, but the style continued until at least the middle of the 20th century through the work of some of the students of the Giverny painters and, the style has been revived in recent years by some contemporary figurative painters.

==Giverny==

While American artists had been painting in the small village of [[Giverny]] since the 1880s, the group of painters who developed the characteristic style known as Decorative Impressionism settled in Normandy after the turn of the 20th Century. They came to a similar way of working because their academic training was similar; they were aware and interested in the developments of [[French Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]; and wanted to adopt some elements from these movements into their own work. Each of them had their own way of working, their own degree of solidity on their figures and their own style of brushwork, but they were all joined together by the beauty of their subjects and their decorative approach.

[[File:Frederick Carl Frieseke - Femme dans un jardin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick Frieseke]]. ''Lady in a Garden''.]]

[[Frederick Frieseke]] was a Michigan born and Chicago-trained artist who had studied in Paris. The American expatriate settled in Giverny in 1906 where he painted female figures in outdoor settings, often using a pastel palette. Influenced by Renoir, Frieseke's canvasses were carefully designed and he often juxtaposed one pattern against another. [[Richard Edward Miller]] was raised and trained in St. Louis, Missouri and he studied in France at the [[Académie Julian]] briefly before his first large figurative works paintings were accepted in the Paris Salon. His early works featured well-drawn figures with more loosely rendered backgrounds, but after he settled in Giverny, his work became brighter and he developed a style where his figures were well modeled, but the backgrounds were often patterns of small brush strokes. [[Image:Miller Girl-with-Guitar550.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard E. Miller]]. ''Girl with a Guitar (Daydreams)'' (1916-17).]]

The California-born artist Guy Rose studied in San Francisco and Paris, coming first under the influence of the Naturalist School and then French Impressionism. He is often described as the most French of the California Impressionists and he visited Giverny before finally settling their with his wife Ethel in 1904. Rose was both a landscape and figurative painter and in Giverny, he painted female figures in outdoor light, keeping the draftsmanship he learned in Paris for the figures and using a more Impressionist style for the setting.

[[Lawton S. Parker]] was an artist and teacher who traveled frequently between the United States and Europe and he settled in Giverny in 1903. Even though Parker shared a Giverny garden with Frieseke, he is not credited with painting figures in garden settings extensively until about 1909. Then, he painted the same sorts of subjects as his Giverny companions. [[Edmund Greacen]] was a New Yorker and he arrived in Giverny in 1907 where he painted a series of garden and domestic subjects in a painterly manner, with a clear French influence. The Chicago-trained painter Karl Anderson was only in Giverny a short time, but it changed the direction of his career and he will always be identified with the French village because he adopted the same subjects and a similar way of working.

[[Image:Reid Robert Lewis Girl with Flowers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]]. ''Girl with Flowers''.]]

In December 1910, six of the Giverny painters - Frieseke, Miller, Parker, Rose, Graecen and Anderson were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them "The Giverny Group" and one of the reviews called them "Impressionists of the very best sort." The German-born Chicago painter Karl Albert Buehr came to Giverny about 1909 and spent summers there until 1912. In Giverny, he turned to painting women in outdoor light, leaving behind the darker tonalities and landscape subjects of his earlier work. Buehr too became associated with Giverny and with French Impressionism and he passed his confidence in the Impressionist palette to his many students.

A younger artist, [[Louis Ritman]], was Russian born and Chicago-trained and he came to Giverny in 1911 and spent the next eighteen summers there, even during World War I, when most of the Americans had left for home. Ritman was highly influenced by Frieseke and he painted women in interior and outdoor settings, usually approaching the figure with some delicacy and handing the background in a manner reminiscent of French Impressionism.

Another American painter whose work clearly falls under the description of "Decorative Impressionism" is [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]]. Although Reid was not part of the Giverny Colony, he was Paris-trained and at the same time it was active, he was working out his own solution of how to reconcile his academic training with a decorative aspect. His solution was different from the Giverny painters. He used boldly decorative compositions, full of cool tones, that had a distinct organic influence that made them reminiscent of [[Art Nouveau]].

==A second generation==

[[Image:lukits orientalharmony550.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Lukits]]. ''Oriental Harmony'' (1918).]]

Because several members of the Giverny Colony were teachers and mentors to a number of other American painters, their style of painting lived on through the works of their students. Two of these artists, the Chicago trained painters [[Theodore Lukits]] and [[Christian von Schneidau]] both ended up in California, where American Impressionism remained popular for a longer time than anywhere else. Both Lukits and Von Schneidau were students of the Giverny Impressionist Karl Albert Buehr, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where they both excelled and won traveling scholarships. Both were also students of Richard E. Miller. Lukits studied with Miller in St. Louis, when he was a young prodigy and von Schenidau studied with him in the art colony of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] where Miller lived until his death. 

Lukits was already doing large, decorative works with well modeled figures and highly patterned backgrounds in Chicago in 1918 and 1919 and he continued the practice in California, with many works of Asian subjects like the silent film actor [[Sōjin Kamiyama]] and portraits like "Mrs. Ray Milland" (1942). Theodore Lukits used the term "Decorative Portraits" himself in describing such works, so the alignment with Brinton's original thesis is clear. Like Miller's work, the artist painted the figure quite realistically, but created the background with more decorative elements. Von Schneidau did several large, very decorative portraits that were exhibited widely in the 1920s and reproduced including "5'O'clock (Mrs. Elwood Riggs)" and "Mary Pickford (Reading the Sundial).

== Design optimization problem ==
{{Main|Optimization problem}}
The formal mathematical ([[Canonical form|standard form]]) statement of the design optimization problem is &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|title=Convex Optimization|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Boyd|first2=Stephen P.|last3=California)|first3=Stephen (Stanford University Boyd|last4=Vandenberghe|first4=Lieven|last5=Angeles)|first5=Lieven (University of California Vandenberghe, Los|date=2004-03-08|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521833783|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h_i(x) = 0, \quad i = 1, \dots,m_1 \\ 
&amp;&amp;&amp;g_j(x) \leq 0, \quad j = 1,\dots,m_2 \\
&amp;\operatorname{and}
&amp; &amp;x \in X \subseteq R^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of ''n'' real-valued design variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''objective function''' 
* &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;'''equality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;g_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; '''inequality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set constraint that includes additional restrictions on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; besides those implied by the equality and inequality constraints.

The problem formulation stated above is a convention called the ''negative null form'', since all constraint function are expressed as equalities and negative inequalities with zero on the right-hand side. This convention is used so that numerical algorithms developed to solve design optimization problems can assume a standard expression of the mathematical problem.

We can introduce the vector-valued functions

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;&amp;&amp;{h = (h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{m1})}\\
\operatorname{and}\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;{g = (g_1, g_2,\dots, g_{m2})}
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt; '' ''

to rewrite the above statement in the compact expression

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h(x) = 0,\quad g(x) \leq 0,\quad x \in X \subseteq R^n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;h, g&lt;/math&gt; the ''set'' or ''system of'' (''functional'') ''constraints'' and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the ''set constraint''.

== Application ==
Design optimization applies the methods of [[mathematical optimization]] to design problem formulations and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term [[engineering optimization]].  When the objective function ''f'' is a [[Vector-valued function|vector]] rather than a [[Scalar field|scalar]], the problem becomes a [[multi-objective optimization]] one. If the design optimization problem has more than one mathematical solutions the methods of [[global optimization]] are used to identified the global optimum.

'''Digital Live Art''' &lt;ref name="DLA"&gt;Sheridan, J.G. (2006). "Digital Live Art: Mediating Wittingness in Playful Arenas". PhD Thesis. University of Lancaster: Lancaster.&lt;/ref&gt; is the intersection of [[Live Art (art form)]], [[Computing]] and [[Human Computer Interaction]] (HCI). It is used to describe live performance which is computer mediated  - an orchestrated, temporal witnessed event occurring for any length of time and in any place using technological means. Digital Live Art borrows the methods, tools and theories from HCI to help inform and analyze the design and evaluation of Digital Live Art experiences.

== Theory ==
Central to the understanding of Digital Live Art is the concept of performance [[framing (social sciences)]]. First identified by [[Gregory Bateson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. (1955). A Theory of Play and Fantasy. Psychiatric research reports, 2, 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; the performance frame is described as a cognitive context where all the rules of behavior, symbols, and their interpretations are bound within a particular activity within its own structure. The concept has since been used extensively in ethnography by [[Erving Goffman]] in his discussions of face to face encounters in the everyday, in discourse structures;&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, D. Framing in Conversational Structures. Cambridge University Press,
Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in theatrical and ritual events;&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, R. The Future of Ritual, Writings on Culture and Performance.
Routledge, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, V. From Ritual to Theatre: The Human Seriousness of Play. PAJ Publications, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; sporting events and festivals;&lt;ref&gt;MacAloon, J. editor. Rite, Drama, Festival, Spectacle. Institute for the Study of Human Issues, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and trance phenomena &lt;ref&gt;d’Aquili, E., Laughlin, C. D., and McMannus, J. editors. The Spectrum of Ritual jacks .
Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; (see:&lt;ref&gt;Rush, M. Security art. Journal of Performance and Art - PAJ, 26(1):113–115, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Goffman’s work uses the concept of performance frame to broadly mean a constructed context within the limits of which individual human agency and social interaction takes place. For example, a theatrical frame,&lt;ref name="Goffman"&gt;E. Goffman. Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience. Harper and Row, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;124–155) involves the construction of a higher-level frame on top of a ‘primary framework’, i.e., the reality in which the fantasy takes place. In this example, actors assume a character, audiences suspend disbelief and events have their meaning transformed (e.g., compare the use of a mobile phone in public with its use in a theatre). Additionally, framings are temporal, meaning that they have specific beginning and endings. While many theorists argue that all social interaction may be seen from a dramaturgical perspective, meaning all everyday social interaction becomes performance in some sense,&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt; Digital Live Art theorists often deliberately align their work with [[Richard Schechner]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Schechner. Performance Theory. Routledge, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; narrowing their analysis to cover more stabilized ‘established’ forms of performance so that performance framing is defined as an activity done within the intended frame ‘by an individual or group’ who have some established knowledge about the frame, and are ‘in the presence of and for another individual or group’.&lt;ref&gt;Benford, S., Crabtree, A., Reeves, S., Flintham, M., Drozd, A., Sheridan, J.G., Dix, A. The frame of the game: Blurring the boundary between fiction and reality in mobile experiences. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Performance framings then, are intentional, temporal and for an audience.

== Method and Tools ==
The goal of interaction in Digital Live Art goes beyond that of traditional HCI methods and theory which focus on usability, functionality and efficiency. HCI and [[CSCW]] models often focus on workplace activities and their tasks, artefacts and goals. This research often leads to a better understanding of how to increase efficiency in the workplace by providing more efficient and usable interfaces. For example, one could conduct [[usability testing]] or [[task analysis]] of how a DJ uses his DJ decks and one could then use this information to design a more efficient system.

However, traditional HCI models tell us little about how the performer-audience relationship develops as a result of users wittingness to interact with the system. The intention with Digital Live Art is not to make more "usable" systems but rather to allow for "participatory transitions"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; - transitions between "witting and unwitting",&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; between observation and participation, between participation and performance. Since the goal with Digital Live Art systems is to "mediate wittingness"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; rather than task-focused interaction, the application of many HCI models, frameworks and methods become insufficient for analyzing and evaluating Digital Live Art.

=== Performance Triad Model ===
Sheridan first introduced the '''Performance Triad Model''' &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, J.G., Dix, A., Lock, S. and Bayliss, A. (2004) Understanding Interaction in Ubiquitous Guerrilla Performances in Playful Arenas. S. In Fincher, P. Markopolous, D. Moore, &amp; R. Ruddle (Eds.): In People and Computers XVIII-Design for Life: 18th British HCI Group Annual Conference, pp. 3-17, Springer-Verlag, 6–10 September, Leeds, UK. {{ISBN|1-85233-900-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for analyzing "tripartite interaction" - interaction between observers, participants and performers. In the Performance Triad Model, tripartite interaction where technology binds tripartite interaction to context and environment. Reeves et al.&lt;ref&gt;S. Reeves, S. Benford, C. O’Malley, and M. Fraser. Designing the spectator experience. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; draws a distinction between a performer and a spectator and how their transitioning relationship as mediated by the interface.

=== Formal Method ===
Dix and Sheridan&lt;ref&gt;Dix, A., Sheridan, J.G., Reeves, S., Benford, S. and O'Malley, C. (2005) Formalising Performative Interaction. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Design, Specification and Verification of Interactive Systems (DSVIS), pp. 15-25, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13–15 July, Newcastle, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a [[formal method]] for analyzing "performative interaction"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; in Digital Live Art. This formal method provides a mathematical technique for deconstructing interaction between witting and unwitting bystanders and observers, participants in the performance and the performers themselves. The work attempts to formalise some of the basic attributes of performative interaction against a background of sociological analysis in order to better understand how computer interfaces may support performance. This work shows how this generic formalisation can be used in the deconstruction, analysis and understanding of performative action and more broadly in live performance.

[[Image:Dobra Kuca castle drawing.jpg|thumb|Imagined sight of castle Dobra Kuća]]
Medieval [[castle]] '''Dobra Kuća''' (meaning "Good House", also {{lang-hu|Dobrakutya}}) was an important fortification of the region in the [[Middle Ages]]. It is often mentioned in Croatian medieval sources. It is situated near city of [[Daruvar]], [[Croatia]]. Dobra Kuća, owned by various persons, was a vivid centre of then rich country. The castle was built after castle Stupčanica in the 14th century. It was first mentioned in 1335, when king [[Charles I of Hungary]] exchanged royal estate of new Litva for castle Dobra Kuća with Dobra Kuća family. While neighbouring castle Stupčanica can be seen from far well, castle Dobra Kuća is a real place of refuge; it is located on a solitary hill surrounded by mountains in every directions and cannot be seen unless you are at the bottom of it.

The [[market town]] of Dobra Kuća was mentioned in 1510s, it belonged to [[Bjelovar-Križevci County]]. The settlement and surrounding area flourished until the conquest by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Ottoman troops captured the castle in 1542 and henceforth controlled it by a guard of thirty men. Following the retreat of Ottomans, Dobra Kuća fell into decay and disrepair.

'''Eberhard Schulze''' is a German [[mosaic]] artist.

He was known for his [[underground art]]work with Hans Unger. These mosaic pieces are based on London sites and 
He has also done works of art by himself using resources such as slate and glass. Schulze was forced to give up mosaic-making, when a [[Spinal cord injury|spinal injury]] forced him into [[Retirement|early retirement]]. In 1965, Schulze and Unger created a large mosaic of the crucifixion for St Jude's Catholic church in [[Wigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude-wigan.org.uk/ |title=Saint Jude's Catholic Church, Wigan, Lancashire, England ‘Christ on the Cross’ – Unger/Eber |publisher=Stjude-wigan.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1970, Schulze designed several posters for [[London Transport Board|London Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Eberhard+Schulze |title=Artist: Eberhard Schulze - Poster and poster artwork collection |publisher=London Transport Museum |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to develop a successful career as a specialist aquarist, becoming England’s leading [[Discus (fish)|discus fish]] breeder. He has written a book on discus fish called ''Discus Fish - The King of all Aquarium Fish''.

He now lives in [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]] in Thailand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9349">The '''Ebla tablets''' are a collection of as many as 1,800 complete [[clay tablet|clay tablets]], 4,700 fragments, and many thousands of minor chips found in the palace archives&lt;ref&gt;Numbers as in R. Biggs, "The Ebla tablets: an interim perspective", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''43''' (1980:76-87); Palace G in the excavation reports.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ancient city of [[Ebla]], [[Syria]]. The tablets were discovered by [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Paolo Matthiae]] and his team in 1974–75&lt;ref name="Moorey"/&gt; during their excavations at the ancient city at [[Tell Mardikh]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans H. Wellisch, "Ebla: The World's Oldest Library", ''The Journal of Library History'' '''16'''.3 (Summer 1981:488-500) p. 488f.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets, which were found ''[[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]]'' on collapsed shelves, retained many of their contemporary clay tags to help reference them. They all date to the period between ca. 2500 BC and the destruction of the city ca. 2250 BC.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"&gt;Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the tablets are held in museums in the Syrian cities of [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], and [[Idlib]].

==Discovery and archaeological context==
The tablets were discovered just where they had fallen when their wooden shelves burned in the final conflagration of "Palace G". The archive was kept in orderly fashion in two small rooms off a large audience hall (with a [[Dais|raised dais]] at one end); one repository contained only bureaucratic economic records on characteristic round tablets, the other, larger room held ritual and literary texts, including pedagogical texts for teaching young scribes. Many of the tablets had not previously been baked, but when all were preserved by the fire that destroyed the palace, their storage method served to fire them almost as thoroughly as if in a [[kiln]]: they had been stored upright in partly recessed wooden shelves, rectos facing outward, leaning backwards at an angle so that the ''[[incipit]]'' of each tablet could be seen at a glance, and separated from one another by fragments of baked clay. The burning shelving pancaked &amp;ndash; collapsing in place and preserving the order of the tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly described in Wellisch 1981:492.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Two languages appeared in the writing on the tablets: [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], and a previously unknown language that used the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform script]] (Sumerian logograms or "[[Sumerogram]]s") as a phonetic representation of the locally spoken [[Eblaite|Ebla language]].&lt;ref name=Hetzron&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hetzron|first1=Robert|title=The Semitic Languages|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05767-1|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWhHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter script was initially identified as [[Canaanite languages|proto-Canaanite]] by professor [[Giovanni Pettinato]], who first deciphered the tablets, because it predated the [[Semitic languages]] of [[Canaan]], like [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Pettinato later retracted the designation and decided to call it simply "[[Eblaite]]", the name by which it is known today.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt;

The purely phonetic use of Sumerian logograms marks a momentous advance in the [[history of writing]].&lt;ref&gt;The point is briefly made by Stephen D. Cole, in a letter "Eblaite in Sumerian Script" in ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''40'''.2 (May 1977:49).&lt;/ref&gt; From the earlier system developed by Sumerian scribes, employing a mixed use of logograms and phonetic signs, the scribes at Ebla employed a reduced number of signs from the existing systems entirely phonetically, both the earliest example of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] (rendering sounds in a system invented for another language) and a major simplifying step towards "[[Usability|reader friendliness]]" that would enable a wider spread of [[literacy]] in palace, temple and merchant contexts.

==Content and significance==
The tablets provide a wealth of information on Syria and Canaan in the Early [[Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;Four volumes of essays on the Ebla language and the archives were published by the Center for Ebla Research, New York University, as the series ''Eblaitica'', begun in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and include the first known references to the "[[Canaanites]]", "[[Ugarit]]", and "[[Lebanon]]".&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt; The contents of the tablets reveal that Ebla was a major trade center. A main focus was economic records, inventories recording Ebla's commercial and political relations with other [[Levant]]ine cities and logs of the city's import and export activities. For example, they reveal that Ebla produced a range of [[beer]]s, including one that appears to be named "Ebla", for the city.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt; Ebla was also responsible for the development of a sophisticated trade network system between city-states in northern Syria. This system grouped the region into a commercial community, which is clearly evidenced in the texts.&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt;

There are [[Regnal year|king lists]] for the city of Ebla, royal ordinances, edicts, treaties. There are [[gazetteer]]s listing [[place name]]s, including a version of a standardized place-name list that has also been found at [[Abu Salabikh]] (possibly ancient [[Eresh (disambiguation)|Eresh]]) where it was dated to ca. 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Pettinato, "L'atlante geografico del vicino oriente attestato ad Ebla e ad Abū Salābikh", ''Orientalia'' '''47''' (1978:50-73).&lt;/ref&gt; The literary texts include hymns and rituals, epics, proverbs.

Many tablets include both [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and Eblaite inscriptions with versions of three basic [[bilingual]] word-lists contrasting words in the two languages. This structure has allowed modern scholars to clarify their understanding of the Sumerian language, at that time still a living language, because until the discovery of the tablet corpus there were no bilingual dictionaries with Sumerian and other languages, leaving pronunciation and other phonetic aspects of the language unclear. The only tablets at Ebla that were written exclusively in Sumerian are [[lexical lists]], probably for use in training [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt; The archives contain thousands of copybooks, lists for learning relevant [[jargon]], and scratch pads for students, demonstrating that Ebla was a major educational center specializing in the training of scribes.&lt;ref name="Dumper"&gt;Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelved separately with the dictionaries, there were also [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] of Sumerian words with their pronunciation in Eblaite.

=== Biblical archaeology ===
{{Further|Ebla-Biblical controversy|Biblical archaeology}}
The application of the Ebla texts to specific places or people in the [[Bible]] occasioned controversy, focused on whether the tablets made references to, and thus confirmed, the existence of [[Abraham]], [[David]] and [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] among other Biblical references.&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt; The sensationalist claims were made by [[Giovanni Pettinato]] and were coupled with delays in the publication of the complete texts, and it soon became an unprecedented academic crisis.&lt;ref name="Moorey"&gt;Moorey, 1991, p.150–152.&lt;/ref&gt; The political context of the modern [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] also added fire to the debate, turning it into a debate about the "proof" for [[Zionism|Zionist]] claims to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt;

However, much of the initial media excitement about supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely deplored as generated by "exceptional and unsubstantiated claims" and "great amounts of disinformation that leaked to the public".&lt;ref&gt;Chavalas, 2003, P.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The present consensus is that Ebla's role in [[biblical archaeology]], strictly speaking, is minimal.&lt;ref name="Moorey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">'''The Eight Views''' (in {{zh|八景}} or {{zh|Bajing}}; Japanese: 八景, pronounced "Hakkei"; and Korean: {{lang|ko|팔경}}) are the most beautiful or otherwise significant scenes of a certain area, a term often used in [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. Historically, various series of eight views were produced; in some cases, such as in the ''[[Eight Views of Xiaoxiang]]'' multiple series, a whole artistic tradition was developed, with a number of artists doing versions of the series. Series of eight views typically appeared in poetry and paintings in the olden times; and now, they may appear in local governments' advertisements to tourists.

'''Factotum''' is both an arts organisation and artists' project that was formed in 2001 by Stephen Hackett and Richard West. They publish [[The Vacuum]] newspaper, put on exhibitions, publish books and make films. In the past they have also run a choir, staged contemporary dance events and organised talks. In 2005 Factotum won a Paul Hamlyn Award for the Visual Arts and participated in Northern Ireland's first showing in the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Factotum's work often involves collaborating with a wide range of other arts organisations, artists and writers.

== Cultural history ==

Factotum are based in [[Belfast]] and their work is often about the city and its history. In 2003 they produced a book and CD called 'Belfast Songs' in which a number of writers, including [[Glenn Patterson]], [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Leontia Flynn]], each wrote about famous songs representing the city. Factotum's work is sometimes documentary or archival in nature, as in their 2005 photographic exhibition 'The English', which was largely made up of previously unseen photographs from the Imperial War Museum's archive of the British army in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s. Their treatment of this historical material can involve an implied cultural criticism in the way it is recontextualised. The Factotum Choir, for example, sang a repertoire made up of songs in praise of Stalin (such as [[Ewan MacColl|Ewan MacColl's]] 'Ballad of Stalin'), corporate songs ('Fokker on the Wing') and national anthems for countries that no longer exist (such as [[Rhodesia]]). Factotum's exhibitions and publications can also be explicit in criticising attempts to rebrand and redevelop Belfast and the role of marketing and Public Relations in general, as in their 2008 show 'A Century of Spin' about PR photography.

== Parody and satire ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cannibal Begorrah.jpg|thumb|Poster for film Cannibal Begorrah included in Factotum's 'Unseen Offscreen' exhibition.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 10 July 2009}}]]  --&gt;
As well as presenting historical material, Factotum's work also frequently involves elements of satire and parody. A special 'Cobbled Quarter' supplement to The Vacuum closely resembled the corporate freesheet 'Laganlines' published by the [[Laganside Corporation|Laganside]] quango to promote their newly branded [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|'Cathedral Quarter']]. It included such events as 'Hermitfest' and the 'Festival of Pathetic Maritime Disasters' much like the facepainting and [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] themed events in the quango's publicity material. Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between documentary and spoof elements of Factotum projects. In 2006 they put on an exhibition about the Factotum Choir in the [[Project Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectartscentre.ie/index.php/archive/archive-va-detail/305-the-choir Information about the Factotum Choir exhibition at the Project Arts Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt; in Dublin (subsequently toured to other venues). This exhibition contained film clips, artefacts (like record covers and a desiccated cat) and an extensive history of the Choir from the 1950s to 2000. Reviewers of the exhibition have been divided as to whether the material in the exhibition is genuine or fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2910481.html Article in Hot Press magazine about the Factotum Choir Exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Factotum organised an exhibition called 'Northern Ireland Unseen Offscreen' as part of the [[Belfast Film Festival]]. The exhibition was of posters for films made in Northern Ireland that were never completed or have subsequently been forgotten and included such titles as 'Cannibal Begorrah' (a horror film set in Fermanagh), 'An Ulster American Folk Park in London' (An 80s small town/ big city corporate drama), 'Dafty Wains Go Buck Mental' (An Ulster Scots gross-out comedy) and 'King Billy's Pink Adventure' (a 70s art house film). Reviewers of this exhibition have expressed scepticism as to how much, if any, of this material is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2592 News story by Culture Northern Ireland questioning whether the Northern Ireland Unseen Offscreen exhibition is factual or parodic.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building once used had the "headless dog" image on the brickwork outside. The scions of Hilden Brewery family set up College Green Brewery (though, in fact, a restaurant and not a brewery - ales are supplied by Hilden Brewery) and used the image as the logo for their "Headless Dog" ale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hildenbrewery.co.uk/beer_bottle_collegegreen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://marksalehouse.com/hildenbrewery.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factotum film ==
In 2009 Factotum finished a film called 'Ditching' a feature length story about two people going on a journey across Northern Ireland in a desolate post-apocalyptic future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">In [[folkloristics]], '''folk belief''' or '''folk-belief''' is a broad genre of [[folklore]]. This category includes a wide variety of behaviors, expressions, and beliefs. Examples of concepts included in this genre are [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[popular belief]], [[folk religion]], [[planting signs]], [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], [[conjuration]], [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]], [[root work]], [[taboos]], [[old wives' tale]]s, [[omens]], [[portents]], the [[supernatural]] and [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref name="GREEN-89"&gt;Green (1997:89).&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk belief and associated behaviors are strongly evidenced among all elements of society, regardless of education level or income. In turn, folk belief is found in an agricultural, suburban, and urban environments alike.&lt;ref name="GREEN-97"&gt;Green (1997:97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
One of a variety of compounds extending from the coinage of the term ''[[folklore]]'' in 1846 (previously ''popular antiquities''), the term ''folk-belief'' is first evidenced in use by British folklorist [[Laurence Gomme]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="OED-folk-belief"&gt;"folk, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016. See also "folklore, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parlance employs the word ''[[superstition]]'' for what folklorists generally refer to as ''folk belief''.&lt;ref name="GEORGES-JONES-1995-122"&gt;For example, see discussion in Georges &amp; Jones (1995:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5298">'''[[Iceland]]ic art''' has been built on [[Western painting|northern European traditions]] of the nineteenth century, but developed in distinct directions in the twentieth century, influenced in particular by the unique [[Geography of Iceland|Icelandic landscape]] as well as by Icelandic mythology and [[Culture of Iceland|culture]].

Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of [[Þórarinn Þorláksson]], who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in [[Copenhagen]], returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Þorláksson was not the only Icelandic artist learning in Denmark at that time: there were several Icelanders, both men and women, at the Academy in the closing years of the century, and these included [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]], who together with Þorláksson created a distinctive portrayal of their home country's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style.

==Landscape painting==
The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement toward [[History of Iceland#Home rule and sovereignty|home rule and independence]], which was very active in this period. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þorláksson and Jónsson. These included [[Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval|Jóhannes Kjarval]], [[Jón Stefánsson (artist)|Jón Stefánsson]], and [[Júlíana Sveinsdóttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment.

==The emergence of abstract art==
[[Abstract art]] became prominent in Iceland in the mid-twentieth century, spearheaded by artists such as [[Svavar Guðnason]] and [[Nína Tryggvadóttir]]. However some of the country's prominent artists working in that period eschewed abstractionism, such as [[Gunnlaugur Scheving]] who instead favoured narrative content and an approach to colour and form possibly influenced by [[fauvism]] and [[cubism]]; and [[Louisa Matthíasdóttir]], based in New York, who learned from [[abstract expressionism]] but nevertheless painted from life.

==The return of figurative art==
[[Einar Hákonarson]]'s show in 1968 distinguished itself from its Icelandic art scene then current as Hákonarson’s paintings were [[Pop art|pop]], [[Figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionistic]]. This exhibition brought the figure back into the Icelandic painting, which had been dominated by the abstract art for years.&lt;ref&gt;Visir ''23.3 1968 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakonarson said he was more influenced by feeling for nature, rather than by trying to paint a specific part of it.&lt;ref&gt;[RUV] Icelandic state TV ''interview 1976 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Icelandic art from the late twentieth century==
[[File:Iceland in April 2016 11.JPG|right|thumb|In Iceland, Ms. Emilía Björg Sigurðardóttir displayed her creation, ''Next Soil'', as part of product design art.]]
The portrayal of the landscape through visual art has remained a prominent (perhaps the most prominent) theme in Icelandic art to the present day, often reflected in the exhibitions at the country's [[National Gallery of Iceland|national gallery]]. Its 2007 summer exhibition, for example, was called "Alas Nature!" and described as an exhibition which "aims to examine nature in a different light and from a different angle from what is generally accepted".&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Iceland, ''Alas Nature!'', http://www.listasafn.is/?expand=0-114&amp;i=114&amp;root=1. Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Debate has occurred within the artistic community as to whether an appropriate balance has been struck in the support of galleries and public institutions for different media, traditions and subjects in Icelandic visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Einar Hákonarson, ''Biography'', http://www.einarhakonarson.com/bio.html. Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IFAN''' ('''I.F.A.N.''', '''Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire''' or '''African Institute of Basic research''') is a cultural and scientific institute in the nations of the former [[French West Africa]].  Founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1938 as the '''Institut français d’[[Sub-Saharan Africa|Afrique noire]]''' (the name was changed only in 1966), it was headquartered in what is now the building of the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]].  Its charge was to study the language, history, and culture of the peoples ruled by [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] in Africa.

==Early history==
IFAN first formed from a combination of three forces: the French colonial "[[Civilizing mission]]", the desire for more efficient [[Indirect rule]] through the understanding of African cultures, and research into the resources of the French dominion in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See: David Robinson. Paths of accommodation: Muslim societies and French colonial authorities in Senegal and Mauritania, 1880-1920, Athens, Ohio University Press (2000) {{ISBN|0-8214-1353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governors General [[Ernest Roume]] (1902–1908) and [[William Ponty]] (1908–1914) oversaw a reorganization of the French higher educational system in the colonies, and placing [[Georges Hardy]] in charge, moved the colonial administration into a model which used elements from both a "Direct", [[Assimilation (French colonial)|Assimilationist]] policy and an [[Indirect rule|Indirect]], rule by African proxy policy.  The first required educational resources be created provided for the small minority of "''assimilated''" Africans, while the later required French colonial administrators be educated in the workings of African societies.  To these ends, Hardy oversaw the creation of the  [[École normale supérieure William Ponty]] (under the administration of [[Joseph Clozel]]), the publication ''Bulletin de l'Enseigement en AOF'', and the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' (1918).  This last, immensely successful as a scientific journal, inaugurated  what one historian has called an era of "..knowledge and control." &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ibid, (p.69 in French language edition, 2004, {{ISBN|2-84586-485-X}} )&lt;/ref&gt;

These imperial (or at best [[paternalist]]) scientific tools were turned on their head in a number of ways.  First, the African higher education system (and the École William Ponty in particular) became the incubator for the political leaders of the independence movement.  The study of African cultures, though invaluable to modern historians, did little to legitimize French rule through their [[Chefs du Canton]], but it did provide Francophone West Africans (such as [[Léopold Senghor]]) with the materials to bolster their sense of cultural importance, as demonstrated in the [[Negritude]] movement.  Finally, Europeans and Africans who opposed colonial rule came together in the years after the founding of IFAN in Dakar. IFAN was first conceived as an integration of various French colonial research systems in the early 1930s, and the vision was one of putting science to the service of the colonial project.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Galliard quotes a publication from the early 30s:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is for us a sort of intellectual duty and a requirement of colonial honour to study the countries that we must administer and the people that we must educate and protect. This is, in part, one of the strongest justifications for colonisation, and it cannot be defined in material and economic terms . . . . The establishment of African science is indeed an exigency of our colonial policy (IFAN, 1961: 37).&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jacques Gaillard. [http://ahero.uwc.ac.za/index.php?module=cshe&amp;action=downloadfile&amp;fileid=81806115512041001233965 "The Senegalese Scientific Community: Africanization, Dependence and Crisis"] in ''Scientific communities in the developing world''. Jacques Gaillard, V.V. Krishna and Roland Waast(eds). New Delhi, Thousand Oaks, Calif., and London: Sage Publications, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jules Brévié]], governor of [[French West Africa]] from 1930 to 1936, wrote that "colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. He wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture, and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=70 |last=Wilder|first=Gary|title=The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude and Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLqOeLn2MfcC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=2015-10-27 |date=2005-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89768-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Popular Front government, in 1936, converted the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' into the Dakar-based IFAN, and placed naturalist [[Théodore Monod]] at its head.
From the opening of the institute in 1938, Monod sought to promote Africans into positions of authority in IFAN, such as ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].  With the end of the [[Second World War]], an influx of African intellectuals and French radicals (such as [[Jean Suret-Canale]]) found homes in IFAN and its branches, some taking part in political agitation through organisations like the [[Popular Front (Senegal)|Senegalese Popular Front]], the [[African Democratic Rally|RDA]], and the [[Communist Study Groups]] of the 1940s.

As independence loomed in the 1950s, IFAN became an increasingly African institution.  It formed a parallel [[National Archives]] to the Archives of the Governor General in Dakar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html Les Archives Nationales du Sénégal: La Bibliothèque, Présentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901172440/http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html |date=2012-09-01 }}. "l'arrêté 4803 du 24 novembre 1947 qui faisait de l'IFAN le dépositaire du dépôt légal".&lt;/ref&gt; with Monod and the IFAN answering directly to the [[Minister of Overseas France]] - a rare degree of autonomy under the [[French West Africa|AOF]] system. By independence IFAN had offices in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Abidjan]], [[Bamako]], [[Cotonou]], [[Niamey]], [[Ouagadougou]], associated centers in [[Douala]] and [[Lomé]], and permanent scientific research stations in [[Atar]], [[Diafarabé]], and [[Mont-Nimba]]. The 1940s and 50s saw more such projects undertaken, such as the 1943 ''Office of Colonial Scientific Research'' (Now the ORSTOM Soil Research Centre in Dakar-Hann) and the [[University of Dakar]] in 1957.  Each of these institutions, begun as colonial instruments, evolved with the coming of independence into African tools to meet African needs.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Galliard, Passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
By independence in 1960 IFAN had branches across French West Africa, in all the cities which were to become the capitals of independent states.  The Dakar IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, and Monod was kept on as director until 1965. In 1986 it was officially renamed "''IFAN Cheikh Anta Diop''", and maintains budgets, administration and staff independent of the university. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture in the world. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.  Most branches of IFAN, notably in [[Conakry]] ([[Guinea]]), [[Abidjan]] ([[Cote d'Ivoire]]), and [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]), became the basis for national archives and research centers. Some still retain the "IFAN" title. The IFAN of [[French Soudan|Soudan Francais]] became the [[National Museum of Mali]], while IFAN of [[French Guinea]] became the ''Institut National de Recherche et Documentation'': the National Library, Archives and Museum of [[Guinea]].

==Publishing==
IFAN publishes a number of academic journals. ''Mémoire de l'IFAN'' and ''{{illm|Bulletin de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire|fr}}'' (abbreviated ''BIFAN'')  mostly deal with [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], history and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliographical essay on pp.304-305 of &lt;br /&gt;Peter Duignan, Lewis H. Gann, Victor Witter. ''Colonialism in Africa'', 1870-1960. Cambridge University Press (1975) {{ISBN|0-521-07859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Centre de Linguistique Appliquée de Dakar, in conjunction with IFAN, has published extensive work on the [[Languages of Africa]], notably the multi-volume ''Lexique Wolof-Français''.  Other sections of IFAN have published collections on everything from the fish to the dance of the West African region.

'''International Print Center New York''' is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the appreciation and understanding of [[fine art]] [[printmaking|prints]].  It was founded by Anne Coffin and established in Chelsea in September 2000 as the only non-profit institution devoted solely to the exhibition and understanding of fine art prints. IPCNY fosters a climate for the enjoyment, examination and serious study of artists' prints from the [[Old Master print|old master]] to the contemporary. IPCNY nurtures the growth of new audiences for the visual arts while serving the print community through exhibitions, publications, and educational programs.

In keeping with their mission to promote the greater appreciation and understanding of the fine art print, IPCNY presents a selection of new prints from emerging to established artists, made within the past twelve months, four times per year.

In addition to its New Prints shows, IPCNY organizes two additional exhibitions per season in its gallery in Chelsea, one in the fall and one in the spring. These exhibitions provide context for the New Prints shows, presenting selections of prints from other periods or cultures. The prints are borrowed from public and private collections, and guest curated by experts in the field.

[[File:GOTHA-cranach-veljo.jpg|thumb|420px|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], ''Law and Gospel'', Herzogliches Museum, Gotha, Germany. {{convert|82.2|x|118|cm|in|abbr=on}}]]

'''''Law and Gospel''''' (or '''''Law and Grace''''') is one of a number of thematically linked, allegorical panel paintings by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] from about 1529. The paintings, intended to illustrate [[Lutheran]] ideas of salvation, are exemplars of Lutheran ''Merkbilder'',&lt;ref&gt;Ehrstine, Glenn (2002). ''Theater, Culture, and Community in Reformation Bern: 1523–1555''. Studies in Medieval and Reformation Thought Vol. 85. Brill. {{ISBN|9789004123533}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were simple, [[Didacticism|didactic]] illustrations of Christian doctrine.

Cranach probably drew on input from his lifelong friend [[Martin Luther]] when designing these panels, which illustrate the [[Protestant]] concept of [[Law and Gospel]]. The earliest forms of the picture are the panels in [[Gotha]], Germany and the [[National Gallery in Prague]]; the Gotha panel is thought to be earlier. The paintings were the basis for many similar works by Cranach and his workshop, Lucas Cranach the Younger, and other artists in diverse forms such as printmaking, relief sculpture and household furnishings.

==Theological context==
[[File:Lucas Cranach - Verdammnis und Erlösung.jpg|thumb|300px|A later (1536) version by Cranach and his son. Oil, gold and paper on panel, transferred on panel]]

The left and right "wings" of the paintings illustrate the Protestant concept of [[Law and Gospel]], which emphasizes salvation through the forgiveness of sins in light of the person and work of Jesus Christ. "Law", or the [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|Old Covenant]], is symbolized on the left, and "Gospel" or "Grace" on the right. The panels illustrate the Lutheran idea that Law is not sufficient for salvation, but Gospel is.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 37&lt;/ref&gt; As Luther wrote in 1522:

{{blockquote|The Law is the Word in which God teaches and tells us what we are to do and not to do, as in the Ten Commandments. Now wherever human nature is alone, without the grace of God, the Law cannot be kept, because since Adam's fall in Paradise man is corrupt and has nothing but a wicked desire to sin... The other Word of God is not Law or commandment, nor does it require anything of us; but after the first Word, that of the Law, has done this work and distressful misery and poverty have been produced in the heart, God comes and offers His lovely, living Word, and promises, pledges, and obligates Himself to give grace and help, that we may get out of this misery and that all sins not only be forgiven but also blotted out... See, this divine promise of His grace and of the forgiveness of sin is properly called Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;Luther in translation by Christensen, C. C. (1979), ''Art and the Reformation in Germany''. Quoted in Kusukawa, Sachiko  (1995). ''The Transformation of Natural Philosophy: The Case of Philip Melanchthon'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The two halves of the panel can be seen as illustrating opposing theologies. Donald Ehresmann wrote in 1967, "The way to salvation set forth on the right side ... is strikingly contrasted to the way of damnation on the left side."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noble, 41&lt;/ref&gt; A more nuanced approach asks the viewer to find a dynamic relationship between Law and Gospel. Art historian Bonnie Noble suggests that in Lutheranism, "law is also the means by which the necessity of grace becomes apparent.... The painting draws a boundary between the dynamics of law and gospel (Lutheran theology) on the one hand, and law on its own (Catholicism or Judaism) on the other".&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Cranach law and grace woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Law and Grace'', woodcut. Cranach, c. 1530]]

On the left, "Law" side of the Gotha painting, a naked man is tormented by a demon and a skeleton (Death) as they force him toward Hell. Other motifs on the left include [[Christ in Judgment]], the [[Fall of Man]], the [[Brazen Serpent]], and [[Moses]] with his tablets. On the right, "Gospel" side, a man interacts with [[John the Baptist]], who is pointing to Jesus as if to say, "He died for you."&lt;ref&gt;Kusukawa, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He stands before both [[Crucifixion of Christ|Christ on the Cross]] and the [[Risen Christ]], whose blood streams onto the man, through the [[Christian symbolism#Dove|Dove]] ([[Holy Spirit]]), making Christ's blood into "the saving waters of baptism".&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, 373&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lamb of God]] stands atop the trampled demons from the left half. A tree divides the two halves of the panel, shown dying on the left side but living on the "Gospel" side. The bottom of the Gotha painting has six columns of New Testament scripture in German, likely chosen by [[Philip Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 15, 27–32, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prague version unifies the two halves by portraying one man sitting in front of the tree, flanked by a prophet on the left and John the Baptist on the right, both of whom point towards Christ. The two panels can be read somewhat differently: it is easier for the viewer to identify with the man when he is the centered subject. Temporally, the Gotha panel shows two men simultaneously facing the consequences of past actions, while the man in the Prague panel clearly has a choice before him. While his "baser" lower body points to the "Law" side, his head and torso turn affirmatively toward John and the "Gospel" half. The painting includes many of the same symbols as the Gotha panel, such as the Brazen Serpent, Moses (at top left), the Fall, and the Crucified and Risen Christ. The [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] now stands on a hill at right. This panel originally contained text that labelled the motifs, but they were lost during cleaning. The Prague composition was the preferred one for many derivative works by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Erhard Altdorfer]], the engraver [[Geoffroy Tory]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, 398&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranach moved the Brazen Serpent motif from the left side in the original two panels to the right in later versions, such as the woodcut. It is an Old Testament story in which God punishes Israelites fleeing Egypt by inflicting them with serpents; they need only look upon the serpent placed on a cross by Moses to be saved. Luther considered the story an example of faith and illustrative of Gospel. The mixture of Old and New Testament concerns in both halves of the panels illustrates that Gospel is not only found in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:Lucas Cranach (I) - The Law and the Gospel.jpg|300px|thumb|''Law and Gospel'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]. Tempera panel. {{convert|72|x|88.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}]]

For Luther and Cranach, artworks such as ''Law and Gospel'' were intended to instill understanding of scripture and Lutheran thought, and the images were deemed acceptable so long as they were subordinate to the written word. The role of these Reformation ''Merkbilder'' contrasted with religious art in other parts of Europe, such as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] and [[Italian Renaissance painting]]. According to Bonnie Noble:

{{blockquote|Earlier art originated from nonscriptural sources and performed nebulous functions, such as to inspire pious meditations or even private visions. Pre-Reformation images could bestow merit upon the beholder and frequently became the objects of veneration themselves. The varied origins and functions of art before the Reformation offered a considerable amount of interpretive freedom to the beholder, a freedom that Lutheran views on images vehemently endeavored to curtail.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the didactic format of the painting seeks to define and limit the viewer's response, making it ripe for art-historical criticism less enamored of such moral or instructive values. In one summary, Cranach's work is described as a "shallow fantasy" that fails to raise the "religious thought world of the Reformers ... to an artistic height"; it is "Protestant allegory overburdened with thoughts" and "overweighted with dry, didactic propagandistic content".&lt;ref&gt;Various critics collected by Weimer, 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has also been analyzed in terms of [[typology (theology)|typology]], in which correspondences between the Old and New Testaments are sought. In this case, the "Law" half is seen to illustrate the Old Testament, and the "Gospel" half the New Testament. For example, the "type" of Moses placing a serpent on a cross is answered by the "antitype" of the Crucifixion. The analysis is complicated by the appearance of Christ in Judgment, from the New Testament, on the "Law" side, and by the Old Testament's Brazen Serpent motif on the "Gospel" side in later versions of the panel.

[[File:Maria Moninckx01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''[[Pelargonium]] lobatum'' (Burm.f.) Willd.&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Maria Moninckx''' (22 April 1673 (baptised) - 26 February 1757 (buried)) was a Dutch botanical artist and painter, best known for the colour plates she and her father, Jan Moninckx, created and which make up the nine-volume ''Moninckx Atlas''. This was published in the period 1686-1709 and depicted 420 plants from the ''Hortus Medicus'' of Amsterdam.  She was born in [[The Hague]] and died in [[Amsterdam]].

==''Hortus Medicus''==
In 1682 [[Joan Huydecoper II]] and [[Jan Commelin]] took the initiative in establishing a new ''Hortus Medicus'' in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a ''Hortus Botanicus''. Huydecoper was mayor of Amsterdam and had great influence with the [[Dutch East India Company]], while Commelin was a merchant in herbs and pharmaceuticals. Both men were well known as enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardeners. Because of their contacts in the business world and their practical horticultural experience,  they received a constant stream of plants, seeds, bulbs and cuttings to be cultivated far from their original habitat.

This led to the creation of one of the richest plant collections in Europe. Plants of commercial value, also potherbs, edible crop plants and medicinal plants, were propagated in the garden for planting elsewhere. An example of this was the [[coffee]] plant, which oddly, was not illustrated in the ''Moninckx Atlas'', but became the backbone of the Brazilian coffee industry. In addition many ornamental plants, especially strange and exotic plants, were cultivated. These plants were grown for pure interest, curiosity value and often for further research.

==Moninckx Atlas==
Between 1686 and 1709, Huydecoper and Commelin commissioned 420 large parchment [[aquarel]]s of plants growing in the Amsterdam garden. The garden did not have a [[herbarium]], and a pictorial record in the form of paintings, would create something of permanent value.

Four very accomplished artists were employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. Maria Moninckx, his daughter, produced 101 paintings. The other artists were [[Alida Withoos]] (13 aquarels) and [[Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff]] (daughter of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]) with 2 sheets; 31 aquarels were unsigned. The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there was an attempt to expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock. The illustrated plants in the first five volumes and part of the sixth, had their names printed in both Latin and Dutch. The Latin names in bold Roman type, and the Dutch names in elegant Gothic calligraphy.

This monumental work is still of great taxonomic, historic, and artistic interest. The aquarels have served as the basis for engravings in the ''Horti Medici Amstelodamensis rariorum plantarum historia'', part 1, by Jan Commelin, appearing in 1697 and part 2, by his cousin Caspar Commelin, in 1701. The famed botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] based the taxonomy for his ''Species plantarum'' of 1753 on no fewer than 259 species from the ''Moninckx Atlas''. A recent scanning of the complete work has made the plates and text available on the [http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?c=botanie;page=index;sid=d44a711aecd3e8dca7c341e56be383e1;tpl=p_moninckx.tpl;corig=botanie;start=1 University of Amsterdam] website.

==Moninckx family==
The Moninckx family had a long tradition of being painters and were researched in a book titled ''De Schildersfamilie Moninckx'', published by [[:nl:Abraham Bredius|Abraham Bredius]] in 1889. Well-known was Gijsbert Moninckx, a member of the Guild of St Lucas in [[The Hague]] in 1605. Bredius' book confuses Maria Moninckx with Machteld Moninckx, the widow of Paulus Dinant.

Maria's father was [[Jan Moninckx]], her collaborator on the ''Moninckx Atlas'', and her mother was Ariaentje Pieters.
On 18 April 1723 Maria signed a betrothal register in Amsterdam, avowing her intention to marry Martinus de la Ruel. Maria's age was given as 47 years and her place of residence as The Hague, while Martinus was 46 years old and from Amsterdam. Maria's signature in the betrothal register corresponds with her signature on the aquarels of the ''Moninckx Atlas''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3471">'''Mogu''' ({{zh|c=沒骨}}) is a [[painting]] skill or technique in traditional [[Chinese painting]]. It literally means "boneless".&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/183922.htm |title=没骨 (Mogu) |publisher=[[Baidu Baike]]  |accessdate=31 May 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bribai/&gt;

On paintings in the style of mogu, forms are made by [[Ink wash painting|ink]] and color washes rather than by outlines.&lt;ref name=bribai&gt;{{cite web|title=baimiao|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/438394/baimiao#ref225112|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Derivation of the name==

There are mainly two derivatives:
* '''''Mogu-Hua''''' (Traditional Chinese: 沒骨畫, or 沒骨畵; Simplified Chinese: 没骨画; Pinyin: Mògǔ Huà; "''Huà''" means "''painting''"), mainly mentions the painting or work has such [[style (visual arts)|style]] or created by such technique.&lt;ref name="Moguhua Biadu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/500333.html |title=没骨画 (Mogu painting) |publisher=[[Baidu Baike]]  |accessdate=31 May 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Mogu-Fa''''' (Traditional Chinese: 沒骨法; Simplified Chinese: 没骨法; Pinyin: Mògǔ Fǎ; "''Fǎ''" means method or technique) emphasizes the technique.&lt;ref name="Mogufa Biadu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/756102.htm |title=没骨法 (Mogu technique) |publisher=[[Baidu Baike]]  |accessdate=31 May 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface by Yun Shouping.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Yun Shouping]]'s ''Mogu'' painting: ''Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface'' (出水芙蓉圖) ([[Palace Museum]], [[Beijing]])]]

According to some ancient records, the technique was first created and theorized by [[Zhang Sengyou]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]] in 557 during the [[Southern dynasties]] period.&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

During the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], a painter named Huang Quan (黄筌) from [[Former Shu]] significantly developed the techniques in [[bird-and-flower painting]], especially in painting trees and flowers, and his painting was called as the fine-sounding name ''Mogu Huazhi'' (沒骨花枝).&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

In [[Tang Dynasty]], notable painters mastered this technique includes Yang Sheng (楊升).

[[Xu Chongsi]] (徐崇嗣) during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] continued developing the technique from Huang, and his paintings were named ''Mogu-Tu'' (沒骨圖). Xu started applying this technique in [[shan shui]] painting.&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

The technique gained popularity during the Late-[[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]], and the most famous master would be [[Yun Shouping]].

==The technique==

The method mainly is a [[staining]] and dying one, by using [[ink brush]] pens. Less or absolutely no [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or [[drawing]], so people can hardly observe solid lines or curves in the painting.

There are basically three ''Mogu'' staining methods: the staining by smearing (渲染; Xuàn-Rǎn), the staining by dotting (点染; Diǎn-Rǎn), and the staining by just filling [[colour]]s (填染; Tián-Rǎn).

'''Nazi chic''' is the use of [[Nazi]]-era style, imagery, and [[paraphernalia]] in clothing and popular culture, especially when used for taboo-breaking or shock value rather than out of genuine sympathies with Nazism.

Its use began in the mid-1970s with the emergence of the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement in London: the [[Sex Pistols]]' first television appearance occurred with [[Siouxsie Sioux]] wearing a [[swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRNOUz7uefA "Today Show - Bill Grundy"] ''ITV''. December 1976. Retrieved 3 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi chic was later used in the fashion industry in various occasions.

==Popular usage==
In the 1970s [[punk subculture]], several items of clothing designed to shock and offend [[The Establishment]] became popular. Among these [[punk fashion]] items was a [[T-shirt]] displaying a [[Swastika]], an upside-down [[crucifix]] and the word ''DESTROY''– which was worn by [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] of the [[Sex Pistols]], seen in the video for "[[Pretty Vacant]]". Rotten wore the swastika another time with a gesture that looked like a [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/punk.html |title=Punk and the Svastika |publisher=acc.umu.se |accessdate=1 July 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321032935/http://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/punk.html |archivedate=21 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, [[Siouxsie Sioux]] of [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] was also known to wear a Swastika armband with fetish [[Sadomasochism|S and M]] clothing, including fishnets and a whip. These musicians are commonly thought to have worn such clothing for shock value directed towards [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|the British WWII generation]] rather than being genuinely associated with any [[National Socialist]] or [[fascist]] ideologies, and those with such interests likely became part of the [[Nazi punk]] or [[white power skinhead]] subcultures.

In 1984, two T-shirt designs featuring [[Adolf Hitler]] were produced in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-toAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Charting the Divide Between Common and Civil Law|first=Thomas|last=Lundmark|date=15 August 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more famous of the two was the "Adolf Hitler European Tour" design, which featured a picture of Hitler against the backdrop of a map of [[Europe]], with conquered territories shaded; and tour dates given as:
*''September 1939 Poland''
*''April 1940 Norway''
*''May 1940 Luxembourg''
*''May 1940 Holland''
*''May 1940 Belgium''
*''June 1940 France''
*''&lt;s&gt;September 1940 England&lt;/s&gt; Cancelled''
*''April 1941 Jugoslavia''
*''May 1941 Greece''
*''June 1941 Crete''
*''A&lt;s&gt;ugust 1942 Russia&lt;/s&gt; Cancelled''
*''July 1945 Berlin Bunker.''

A less popular T-shirt featured Hitler giving the [[Roman salute]], and a [[yo-yo]] hanging from his hand. The text read "European yo-yo champion 1939-1945". Sale of the apparel led to a legal case in Germany, in an attempt to have it banned as "glorifying genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/global_law/german-cases/cases_bverg.shtml?03apr1990|title=UCL Laws : Institute of Global Law&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local courts ruled against the shirt makers, although [[Bavaria]]n state courts later ruled in their favor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1988, [[Ralph Engelstad]] was criticized for a party he held at his [[The Linq|Imperial Palace]] hotel-casino in Las Vegas featuring bartenders wearing the "European Tour" shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19890503&amp;id=STEyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4910,459971&amp;hl=en|title=Lawrence Journal-World - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[ACLU]] represented a high school student on [[Long Island]] who was told to remove the shirt or face suspension by school officials who claimed the shirt was anti-semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/ACLU-Takes-Up-Case-of-Student-Forced-to-Remove-Hitler-Shirt/id-d78b2745d004cc918c556f0415f12786|title=ACLU Takes Up Case of Student Forced to Remove Hitler Shirt|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'', [[Bryan Ferry]], the English singer and musician, acknowledged that he calls his studio in west London his "[[Führerbunker]]". He was quoted as saying, "My God, the Nazis knew how to put themselves in the limelight and present themselves. ... [[Leni Riefenstahl|Leni Riefenstahl's]] movies and [[Albert Speer|Albert Speer's]] buildings and the mass parades and the flags - just amazing. Really beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bryan Ferry's Nazi Gaffe|publisher=The Independent|last=Goodchild|first=Sophie|date=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Later Ferry denied ever making this statement, and the newspapers printed a rectification.) The [[United States|American]] [[glam metal]] band [[Mötley Crüe]] inserted in the booklet of the album ''Mötley Crüe'' (1994) an image of [[Nikki Sixx]] dressed as a Nazi. Officially, the photo was related to lyrics about judging by appearances, but in actuality was inserted to mock the media.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The discographer decided to cancel that photo and to reprint the whole booklet. In the Mötley Crüe autobiography, ''[[The Dirt]]'', the band writes about their "Nazi Wednesdays", in which they used to walk down the street dressed in Nazi uniforms.{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

English rock musician [[Lemmy]] of the band [[Motörhead]] collected Nazi memorabilia and had an [[Iron Cross]] on his bass guitar, but stated that he collected these memorabilia for aesthetic values only, and considered himself an [[anarchist]] or [[libertarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=damage case|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm|work=Russian MOTÖRHEAD Home page|accessdate=26 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526042049/http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm|archivedate=26 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2005 a designer using the pseudonym "[[The Day the Clown Cried|Helmut Doork]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metzitzah.blogspot.com/2007/10/auschwitz-souvenir-t-shirt.html|title=Metzitzah B’peh: Auschwitz Souvenir T-shirt|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; began marketing a parody souvenir T-shirt with the slogans "My grandparents went to Auschwitz and all I got was this lousy t-shirt!" and "[[Arbeit Macht Frei]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3336745,00.html|title=Auschwitz t-shirts for sale?|date=12 June 2006|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to a complaint from the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the design was removed from [[CafePress.com|CafePress]]' website in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/4936_52.htm|title=Online Retailer Removes Auschwitz T-Shirts After ADL Voices Concern&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The creator later uploaded it to Printfection.  After Printfection removed it without explanation the creator then released it into the public domain, giving anyone permission to print and/or commercialize the design without permission. [http://metzitzah.blogspot.com]

[[Prince Harry]] was criticized for wearing a costume with a swastika armband&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4170083.stm Harry says sorry for Nazi costume] BBC News, January 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; causing considerable embarrassment to his family. He later issued a public statement apologizing for his actions, but his lack of apology in person angered some groups.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Harry's impromptu costume resembled the [[Afrika Korps]], rather than more political units such as the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4170623.stm Harry public apology 'not needed'] BBC News, January 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi chic is a controversial topic in the [[fetish clothing]] [[subculture]]. The symbolism of fascistic ideologies remains popular, and a common compromise is to adopt the main design features of Nazi-era clothing– such as peaked caps, jackboots and trenchcoats– but not to include any explicit Nazi symbols. Sometimes substitute symbols are used, with designs that clearly reference the design styles of Nazi symbols without directly copying them.

Some clubs ban the wearing of the [[swastika]] or explicitly Nazi-style uniforms as part of their [[Dresscode (BDSM)|dresscode]].

== Nazi chic in Asia ==

Uniforms and other imagery related to [[Nazi Germany]] are sold in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South East Asia]], where some consider it fashionable. Hong Kong and Japan have each witnessed a growth in the casual wearing of [[SS uniform]]s, as well as increased interest in [[Rock Against Communism|White power music]]. Sometimes in East Asia, Nazi uniforms are used as part of [[cosplay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesinrocks.com/2011/11/28/actualite/le-nazi-chic-la-nouvelle-mode-qui-fascine-de-jeunes-chinois-116107/ Le Nazi chic, la nouvelle mode qui fascine de jeunes Chinois] (french)&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, an area generally isolated from Nazi cultural influences during the Nazi era, [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] observed in 2000 "an unthinking fascination with the icons and imagery of the [[Third Reich]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0605/southkorea.trouble.html|title="They Dressed Well" A troubling fascination with Third Reich regalia elevates the Nazi look to what's chic in South Korea |journal=Time Asia|date=2000-06-05 |accessdate=2007-04-15|first=Donald|last=MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indonesia, the Soldatenkaffe, a café featuring nazi decoration and memorabilia closed in 2013 due to controversies and critiques by international media as well as death threats and hate mail to the owners.

The SoldatenKaffe closed again in 2017 due to moving elsewhere for lack of local demand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/nazi-themed-caf-in-indonesia-re-opens-keeping-the-swastikas-and-images-of-hitler-it-pledged-to-9554643.html Nazi-themed café in Indonesia reopens — keeping the swastikas and images of Hitler it pledged to remove] The Independent 22 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the world, [[World War II]] is not taught in schools as a battle of political ideologies, but as a conventional war. This type of education treats Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]] as charismatic and powerful leaders of countries during wartime, instead of war criminals as elsewhere. [[George Burdi]], the former head of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[record label]] [[Resistance Records]], claimed to have sold many CDs to Japan, because [[Ehrenarier|some Japanese]] believe themselves to be the [[master race]] of the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revoltns.blogspot.com/2009/10/george-burdi-interview.html|title=Revolt NS: George Burdi interview|first=|last=Revenge|date=8 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' became a best-seller in early 2005 following price cuts and rising [[Turkish nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mein Kampf sales soar in Turkey |author=Helena Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/29/turkey.books |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 March 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' sells 50,000 copies in Turkey in three months |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=13511 |newspaper=The Daily Star via Agence France Presse |date=March 18, 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nihonga''''' ({{lang|ja|日本画}}, "[[Japan]]ese-style paintings") are [[Japanese painting]]s from about 1900 onwards that have been made in accordance with traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and materials. While based on traditions over a thousand years old, the term was coined in the [[Meiji period]] of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], to distinguish such works from Western-style paintings, or ''[[Yōga]]'' ({{lang|ja|洋画}}).

== History ==
The impetus for reinvigorating traditional painting by developing a more modern Japanese style came largely from many artist/educators, which included; [[Shiokawa Bunrin]], [[Kōno Bairei]], [[Tomioka Tessai]], and [[art critic]]s [[Okakura Tenshin]] and [[Ernest Fenollosa]] who attempted to combat [[Meiji period|Meiji Japan's]] infatuation with Western culture by emphasizing to the Japanese the importance and beauty of native Japanese traditional arts. These two men played important roles in developing the curricula at major art schools, and actively encouraged and patronized artists.

''Nihonga'' was not simply a continuation of older painting traditions. In comparison with ''[[Yamato-e]]'' the range of subjects was broadened. Moreover, stylistic and technical elements from several traditional schools, such as the ''[[Kanō school|Kanō-ha]],'' ''[[Rinpa school|Rinpa]]'' and ''[[Maruyama Ōkyo]]'' were blended together. The distinctions that had existed among schools in the [[Edo period]] were minimized.

However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' form a distinct category within the Japanese annual [[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]] exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

The artist [[Tenmyouya Hisashi]] has (b. 1966) developed a new art concept in 2001 called "Neo-Nihonga".

=== Development outside Japan ===
''Nihonga'' has a following around the world; notable ''Nihonga'' artists who are not based in Japan are [[Hiroshi Senju]], , [[United States|American]] artists [[Makoto Fujimura]] and Judith Kruger, and [[Miyuki Tanobe]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judithkruger.com/|title=SELECTED WORK|publisher=Judith Kruger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian artist Madhu Jain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madhujain.com|title=Madhu Jain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwanese artist Yiching Chen teaches workshops in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yiching.free.fr/|title=NIHONGA - Peinture japonaise YICHINGCHEN|first=|last=YICHINGCHEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Judith Kruger initiated and taught the course "Nihonga: Then and Now" at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Savannah, Georgia Department of Cultural Affairs.

Contemporary Nihonga has been the mainstay of New York's Dillon Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dillongallery.com|title=EXHIBITIONS|publisher=Dillon + Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key artists from the "golden age of post war Nihonga" from 1985 to 1993 based at Tokyo University of the Arts have produced global artists whose training in Nihonga has served as a foundation. [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Hiroshi Senju]], Norihiko Saito, Chen Wenguang, Keizaburo Okamura and [[Makoto Fujimura]] are the leading artists exhibiting globally, all coming out of the distinguished Doctorate level curriculum at Tokyo University of the Arts. Most of these artists are represented by Dillon Gallery.

== Materials ==
''Nihonga'' are typically executed on ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper) or ''eginu'' ([[silk]]), using brushes. The paintings can be either monochrome or polychrome. If monochrome, typically ''[[Inkstick|sumi]]'' (Chinese ink) made from [[soot]] mixed with a glue from fishbone or animal hide is used. If polychrome, the [[pigment]]s are derived from natural ingredients: [[mineral]]s, shells, [[coral]]s, and even [[Gemstone|semi-precious stone]]s like [[malachite]], [[azurite]] and [[cinnabar]]. The raw materials are powdered into 16 gradations from fine to sandy grain textures. A [[Animal glue#Hide glue|hide glue]] solution, called ''nikawa'', is used as a binder for these powdered pigments. In both cases, water is used; hence ''nihonga'' is actually a [[Watercolor painting|water-based medium]]. ''Gofun'' (powdered [[calcium carbonate]] that is made from cured [[oyster]], [[clam]] or [[scallop]] shells) is an important material used in ''nihonga''. Different kinds of ''gofun'' are utilized as a ground, for under-painting, and as a fine white top color.

Initially, ''nihonga'' were produced for hanging scrolls (''[[kakemono]]''), hand scrolls (''[[emakimono]]''), sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') or folding screens (''[[byōbu]]''). However, most are now produced on paper stretched onto wood panels, suitable for framing. Nihonga paintings do not need to be put under glass. They are archival for thousands of years.

== Techniques ==
In monochrome ''Nihonga'', the technique depends on the modulation of ink tones from darker through lighter to obtain a variety of shadings from near white, through grey tones to black and occasionally into greenish tones to represent trees, water, mountains or foliage. In polychrome ''Nihonga'', great emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of outlines; typically outlines are not used for depictions of birds or plants. Occasionally, [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and layering of pigments are used to provide contrasting effects, and even more occasionally, [[gold]] or [[silver]] leaf may also be incorporated into the painting.

== Biography ==

Olena Golub was born on December 25, 1951 in [[Kyiv]], in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], to an intellectual family.
Her parents acted on stage as a singers before her father, Yevgen Golub, became a journalist and her mother, Zinaida Morozova, became an official. She graduated from [[Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv]] in 1974, department of biophysics. She worked for some time as an engineer, but dreamed of becoming a professional artist. In the 1970s she refused to join the Arts' Academy, against creating compositions in the spirit of Soviet ideology. Thus, she took private drawing lessons and graduated from the Institute of Journalistic Skill in 1986, Faculty Artists press.

She worked as an illustrator in  magazines, an editor at the publishing house, etc. She is author of more than 100 publications on contemporary art. Her husband is culturologist Peter Yakovenko and her daughter is photographer Anna Golub. Her son Andrey Yakovenko is a designer. She lives in Kiev and frequently travels abroad with exhibitions.

==Creativity==
Her career began with opposition to the [[Socialist Realism]] in a circle of [[Underground culture|underground]] artists, when she was writing in the style of [[Expressionism]].  Avant-garde young people in Kiev founded an association, the Rukh Movement, in which writers, scientists, and artists gathered. In 1977 they organized an exhibition with artists [[Yuri Kosin]], Nik Niedzelski, Mikola Trehub, Vudon Baklitsky, [[Alexander Kostetsky]], Olena  Golub, [[Nicholas Zalevsky]]  and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Olena Golub''. Anniversary of an underground exhibit.//Den (The Day), 2007, &amp;nbsp;—№38 Tuesday,11.[http://www.day.kiev.ua/193090]&lt;/ref&gt;
Her memories about underground time and artists persons were printed in the book (in Ukrainian) ''Olena Golub''.THE BRIGHT AND GLOOMY DAYS OF UNDERGROUND ARTISTS. Kyiv, Published House “Antiquary”, 2017, {{ISBN|978-617-7285-11-2}}

Her artworks was inspired by [[Ukrainian avant-garde]] in the beginning of the 20th century, particularly by  [[Wassily Kandinsky]] ("Engineer's portrait", "Empty plate", "Two", etc.)

The second surge of lifting art by Olena Golub is associated with the revival of civic activities and the advent of private galleries, where she began to exhibit new works. Her paintings such as "Aunt", "Fisherman", "Chupa-chups, or the illusion of equality" increased the social-critical motif with characteristic of Ukrainians humor.

Since 2003, Lena began to create photo installations using computer technology.  Art critic  Nina Sayenko  has written:  {{text | «Turning to contemporary computer technologies, the artist, as is her custom, pungently felt the pulse and rhythm of the time. By confronting and comparing various historical photographic materials she is in the process of solving philosophical problems of existence itself. The new series features the transformation of family traditions and generational ties along with the global transformation of conscience in material reviewing the totalitarian past (Yes and No, The Totalitarian Ballade, and Recipient Unknown). 
Olena Golub calls upon us to return to human problems and perception of the human essence. In her works the fates of historical persons (Stalin, Hitler, etc) are closely interlaced with personages from family albums, who act together in the historical context. They pose questions about everybody’s connection with and responsibility for everything that ever happened or is happening now (Who to Be With? and He, She, They...). 
Today Olena Golub is on a new turn in her creative flight. One cannot but wish to become one of the characters she has created, the Yellow Hare, rising high above our omnivorous globalization and broad expansion of the mass media and fill oneself with the sense of freedom and independence.»}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nina Saenko]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13338">A '''pornographic parody film''' is a subgenre of the [[pornography|pornographic film industry]] genre where the basis for the production's story or [[plotline]] is the parody of a [[mainstream]] [[television show]], [[feature film]], [[public figure]], [[video game]] or literary works. This subgenre also includes parody of historical or contemporary events such as [[political scandal]]s. The subgenre has gained acceptance by the adult industry to the extent that major awards are presented in  this category by organizations such as [[31st AVN Awards#Major Awards|AVN]] and [[XRCO Award#Best Comedy or Parody|XRCO]].

==Origin==
''PornParody.com'', a website dedicated to reviewing porn parodies, cites the 1973 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' spoof ''[[Bat Pussy]]'' as possibly the earliest known pornographic parody film,&lt;ref name="BPPornParody"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |title=Bat Pussy – the first superhero porn parody? |date=October 6, 2014 |publisher=PornParody.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008174205/http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |archivedate=October 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which is also shared with the 1973 German animated short ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]''.&lt;ref name=1973Snow&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Snow White and the Seven Perverts (1973) 11 min - Animation : Short : Comedy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782084/|publisher=Amazon via IMDb|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre began taking off in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Brilliant&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=The 14 Most Brilliant Porn Parodies of All Time|url=http://www.details.com/sex-relationships/porn-and-perversions/201002/the-most-brilliant-porn-parodies-of-all-time#/slide=4|publisher=Conde Nast via Details.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; experiencing a surge in popularity during the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name=Wave&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutter|first=Jarod|title=The Big New Wave of Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/The-Big-New-Wave-of-Porn-Parodies-348804.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In 2002, ''Shaving Ryan's Privates'', a movie starring actor-turned-infosec analyst Jeff Bardin, was released. The movie documented porn films that parody classic Hollywood movies. There have been porn parodies produced of [[sitcoms]] such as ''[[Who's The Boss]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', horror and drama movies such as ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', [[sci-fi]] and [[action movie]] blockbusters such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', and of [[Costume drama|period drama]] such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', titled ''[[Down on Abby]]''. The genre includes both [[heterosexual]] as well as [[homosexual]] versions as a "gay porn parody" of the [[reality television series]] ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'' has been produced among others. Parodies also include non-story or event specific productions such as the [[Who's Nailin' Paylin?|several parodies]] that feature a [[Sarah Palin]]-like character.&lt;ref name=AVNPalinPorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasner|first=Paul|title=Behind the Sarah Palin Porn Movie|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Behind-the-Sarah-Palin-Porn-Movie-56373.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Kate|title=The Complete Guide To Porn Parodies of Movies,TV, Celebrities and Politicians|url=http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2013-12-19/porn-parody/|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=io9Guide&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Some parodies utilize techniques such as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref name=HuffSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|title='Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody' Trailer (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/star-wars-xxx-a-porn-paro_n_1194950.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie reviewer commented that the costume of a particular [[comic book]] character in a porn parody was a "better version" of the one used in the mainstream movie.&lt;ref name=BaDigest&gt;{{cite web|last=Faraci|first=Devin|title=The Porno Version Of Quicksilver Looks Better Than The X-MEN Version|url=http://badassdigest.com/2014/02/02/the-porno-version-of-quicksilver-looks-better-than-the-x-men-version/|publisher=Badass Digest|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and review==
Journalist and author [[Charlie Jane Anders]] wrote, prior to blogging on the subject, "I didn't realize just how many porn parodies there are — and how terrible most of them actually are."&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] writer commented that although the parody of the [[PBS]] series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' titled ''Down on Abby'' starring Lexi Lowe is humorous, it is "rife with historical inaccuracies" and "not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off [[French manicure|French tips]] and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]]."&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoeffel|first=Kat|title=Downton Abbey Porn Parody Rife With Historical Inaccuracies|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/downton-abbey-porn-rife-with-inaccuracies.html|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry acceptance===
Acknowledging its origins and public appeal,&lt;ref name=parody/&gt; several industry publications and trade groups have created award categories for the genre. Two of the industry's major award programs offer recognition for this category of adult film.

The [[AVN Award]] added the categories of "Best Parody - Comedy" and "Best Parody - Drama" in 2009.&lt;ref name=parody&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Best-Sex-Parody-Category-Added-to-AVN-Awards-361583.html | title=Best Sex Parody Category Added to AVN Awards | publisher=Adult Video News | date=September 29, 2009 | accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody ''Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody'' was that year's most nominated production as well as the winner of the Comedy category.&lt;ref name=2013AVN&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/And-Now-The-2013-AVN-Award-Winners-503520.html | title=And Now... The 2013 AVN Award Winners! | work=AVN Staff | publisher=Adult Video News | date=2013-01-20 | accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the category of "Best Director" for a "Parody and Best Celebrity Sex Tape" was added.&lt;ref name="2013nominees"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/AVN-Awards-2012-The-Nominees-456084.html | title=AVN Awards 2012: The Nominees | publisher=Adult Video News | date=December 6, 2011 | accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[XRCO Award]] added its category of "Best Parody" in 2003.&lt;ref name=2003XRCO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Jules Jordan, Evil Angel, Elegant Angel, Wicked Pictures Capture XRCO Awards|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Jules-Jordan-Evil-Angel-Elegant-Angel-Wicked-Pictures-Capture-XRCO-Awards-40011.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the award went to the [[Wicked Pictures]]-produced and [[Jonathan Morgan (director)|Jonathan Morgan]]-directed film ''Space Nuts'', a parody of the [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[Spaceballs]]'' - itself a parody of ''[[Star Wars]]''. ''Space Nuts'' also won the 2004 AVN award for Best Parody - Comedy.&lt;ref name=2003XRCO/&gt;

===Mainstream media===
The genre has gained the attention of the [[mainstream press]]. In 2009 director Jeff Mullen (a.k.a. [[Will Ryder]]) was interviewed by ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Joshua Alston about his leading role in the resurgence of porn parodies.&lt;ref name=AVNNewsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Peter|title='Newsweek' Talks to Jeff Mullen About Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Newsweek-Talks-to-Jeff-Mullen-About-Porn-Parodies-357597.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news|last=Alston|first=Joshua|title=Porn Parody of TV Sitcoms Is Adult Entertainment's 'New Gold Rush'|url=http://www.newsweek.com/porn-parody-tv-sitcoms-adult-entertainments-new-gold-rush-220586 |accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=''Newsweek''|date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Adult Video News]]'' writer Tom Hymes observed, "I have come to the realization that a very real expectation is being created among the celebrity elite: Will my show be the next XXX parody... please?" "What is kind of brilliant about the whole thing is the fact that these mainstream shows and the actors on them now get to rub shoulders with the porn industry without any actual rubbing. That's why I call them the new celebrity-safe sex tapes for safe-sex celebrities."&lt;ref name=CelebSafe&gt;{{cite web |last=Hymes |first=Tom |title=Are Porn Parodies the New Celebrity-Safe Sex Vid? |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Are-Porn-Parodies-the-New-Celebrity-Safe-Sex-Vid-366766.html |publisher=Adult Video News |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' interview with [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]], creator of the [[HBO]] original series ''True Blood'', he stated, "We just found out that they're doing a porn parody of ''[[True Blood]]''. That's certainly a moment of going 'Wow, we've arrived.'"&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX&gt;{{cite web |last=Javors |first=Steve |title=Ann Paquin Gifts 'True Blood' Porn Parody to Cast, Crew |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Ann-Paquin-Gifts-True-Blood-Porn-Parody-to-Cast-Crew-407676.html |work=[[Adult Video News]] |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, actress [[Anna Paquin]] talked about the porn parody of her own show, ''[[True Blood]]'', on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] late night [[talk show]] ''[[Lopez Tonight]]''. Paquin stated, "You know, actually what's interesting is that [fellow cast member] [[Stephen Moyer|Steve]] [Moyer] and I were so amused by it that we got it for everyone on our cast and crew as a wrap gift so I think we probably bought every copy in existence." Copies of ''Tru: A XXX Parody'' were given to the entire cast and crew at the [[wrap party]] for the show's [[True Blood (season 3)|third season]].&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX/&gt;

==Fictional pornography==

Fictional pornography is sometimes used for plot or humor in mainstream film and TV. In ''[[Friends]]'', [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe's]] twin sister starred in ''Buffay, the Vampire Layer'' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alloy.com/entertainment/the-7-best-instances-of-doppelganger-sex/4/|title=The 7 Best Instances of Doppelganger Sex - Page 4 of 4|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List_of_Two_and_a_Half_Men_characters#Lyndsey_McElroy|Lyndsey]] in ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' was the title role of ''Cinnamon's Buns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/two-and-a-half-men-keeps-getting-worse-cinnamons-buns-and-master-bakin-1848199441.html|title='Two And A Half Men' Keeps Getting Worse – 'Cinnamon's Buns And Master Baking' Recap|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Wilson (House)|Wilson]] in ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' acted in ''Feral Pleasures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/03/09/house-wilson-and-wood-nymphs-made-a-porno/|title='House': Wilson and wood nymphs made a porno|date=9 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Stormare]]'s character in ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' can be seen in ''Logjammin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2010/04/07/does-the-big-lebowski-porn-parody-actually-look-good/|title=Does 'The Big Lebowski' Porn Parody Actually Look Good?|first=Alison|last=Nastasi|date=7 April 2010|website=AOL Moviefone|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">A '''print-disabled person''' is "a person who cannot effectively read print because of a visual, physical, perceptual, developmental, cognitive, or learning disability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The definition of "print disabled"?|url=http://www.readingrights.org/definition-print-disabled|publisher=Reading Rights Coalition|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A print disability prevents a person from gaining information from printed material in the standard way, and requires them to utilize alternative methods to access that information. Print disabilities include [[visual impairment]]s, [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], or [[physical disability|physical disabilities]] that impede the ability to manipulate a book in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a print disability?|url=https://www.learningally.org/support-topic/what-is-a-print-disability/|publisher=Learning Ally|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by George Kerscher, a pioneer in digital talking books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deborah Kendrick|title=George Kerscher: A Pioneer in Digital Talking Books Still Forging Ahead|url=http://www.afb.org/afbpress/pub.asp?DocID=aw020304&amp;Mode=Print|publisher=AFB AccessWorld Magazine|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conference organised by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], in June 2013 adopted a special treaty called "A Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities" (briefly [[Marrakesh VIP Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/vip_dc/vip_dc_8_rev.pdf|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/dc2013/en/|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marrakesh Treaty represents an important change in how law makers balance the demands of copyright owners against the interests of people with disabilities in particular, and a potential point of inflection in global copyright politics more generally.

==History==
The Quilt of Belonging was an art-in-community project, created by volunteers from [[Victoria, Canada|Victoria]] to [[Newfoundland]] to the [[Arctic Circle]], each of whom were invited to contribute a  quilt piece reflecting their cultural backgrounds.  The work was completed between 1999 and 2005.  The materials in the pieces range from [[sealskin]] to African [[mud-cloth]], from embroidered [[silk]] to [[gossamer wings]] of [[butterflies]].

The inaugural exhibition of the completed ''Quilt of Belonging'' and the launch of the ''Quilt of Belonging'' book took place April 1, 2005 at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau (Ottawa). The quilt, which was designed as a traveling exhibit, then went on a five-year tour across Canada, including communities in the arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manitoulin.ca/2014/09/17/quilt-belonging-brings-canadas-diversity-manitoulin/ "Quilt of Belonging brings Canada’s diversity to Manitoulin"]. ''Manitoulin Expositor'', September 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the art exhibit of its kind to tour in [[Inuit]] communities.

In 2017, as part of Canada's 150th birthday celebration, the Quilt of Belonging is making another tour across Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chch.com/quilt-of-belonging/ "Quilt of Belonging"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">'''Sewed muslin''' was a [[fashion]] imported from [[Paris]] in the late 18th century. Related to [[tambour lace]], it was worked on very fine [[muslin]], and used a variety of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es to create motifs, usually depicting flowers and plants (hence its other name, ''flowered muslin'').

==Sewed muslin industry in Scotland==
A notable developer of the industry in Scotland was [[Mrs Jamieson]], the wife of an [[Ayrshire]] cotton agent. Seeing a philanthropic opportunity, she set out to teach local farmers' wives and daughters the trade, focusing on firm satin stitch, overcast fillings, and fine lace stitches in cut-out spaces. The designs were drawn up by professional draughtsmen in [[Glasgow]] before being sent out to be [[embroidered]] by outworkers. They were then bleached, made up, boxed and widely [[marketed]], proving especially popular in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Ayrshire and Other Whitework'' (Shire Publications, 2001), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, the industry provided (often part-time) employment to as many as 105,000 women and children in [[Scotland]], or approximately 86% of the entire workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cooke, ''The Rise and Fall of the Scottish Cotton Industry, 1778-1914'' (Manchester University Press, 2010), p. 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the industry on the local population was noted by the minister of [[Houston, Renfrewshire]] in the 1790s, when he wrote that it allowed many young women "not only [to] maintain themselves, but [to] buy fineries."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The muslins used in this industry came largely from local mills: the first cotton mills had been built in west Scotland in the 1770s, and by the 1780s the quality was high enough to supply the demand for fine white muslins, which became ''de rigueur'' to achieve the neo-classical style of dress.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Toomer, ''Embroidered With White'' (Heather Toomer Antique Lace, 2008), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ayrshire whitework industry was a victim of its own success, starting to decline from the 1830s onwards, after the patenting of the first [[embroidery machine]] in 1828,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed similar motifs to be produced at a fraction of the cost. It continued in popularity until the 1850s, when a combination of over-production and cotton shortages imposed by the [[American Civil War]] saw to its demise.

Sewed muslin from the wider Glasgow area came to be known as Ayrshire whitework, and is extremely similar to French whitework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrshire whitework|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Ayrshire-whitework|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between them is that French whitework is usually worked on [[cambric]] rather than [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shada''''' is an unaired serial of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was intended as the final serial of the 1979–80 season ([[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]]) but was never completed, owing to [[strike action]] at the [[BBC]] during filming.

The BBC released a completed version of ''Shada'' in 2017, with missing dialogue newly recorded by the original cast, using the same audio equipment employed in the initial shoot, and animated by the team that undertook the animated version of the 1966 serial ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-10-10/doctor-who-shada-tom-baker/#r3z-addoor|title=BBC regenerates ‘lost’ Tom Baker Doctor Who story Shada|publisher=''Radio Times''|date= |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0767QDR9X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1|title=Doctor Who Shada|date=25 November 2017|website=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous attempts to present the story include a narrated reconstruction for [[2 Entertain|BBC Video]]; a re-imagined [[radio drama|audio play]] by [[Big Finish Productions]], also offered with basic [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] imagery on [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] and the BBC Doctor Who website; and a novelisation by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], based on the latest shooting scripts, with the author's own additions.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
&lt;!--The plot summary shouldn't be longer than 400 words - current word count 311. DO NOT add further details to this plot summary; only amend sentences if need correcting, and please adhere to MS:TVPLOT.--&gt;

The Doctor answers a distress signal from Professor Chronotis, a Time Lord posing as a professor at [[St. Cedd's College, Cambridge]] who loaned a Gallifreyan tome to his student Chris Parsons. The Doctor retrieves the book while Chronotis dies after his mind was extracted by the sphere of a mad scientist named Skagra, living long enough to warn Romana, Parsons, and K9 of them and Shada. The Doctor locates Skagra's cloaked spacecraft, only for his companions to be captured while Skagra has his sphere extract the Doctor's mind to decode the book before taking Romana in the TARDIS to his carrier ship and Krarg creations. But the Doctor survived his ordeal with his mind intact and has ship's computer release Chris and K9 and take them to a space station Skagra previously occupied. The group find Skagra's discarded colleagues and learn he is after a Time Lord named Salyavin.

Back on Earth, Clare Keightley accidentally revives Chronotis whose chambers are revealed as a TARDIS, the Professor explaining the book is a key to the prison planet Shada where Salyavin is held. Chronotis and Clare repair the TARDIS to reach Skagra's carrier, saving the Doctor and Chris after Skagra decoded the book and reveals his intent to absorb Salyavin's mind and use its telepathy to unite all life into a single Universal Mind. The group reach Shada as Skagra releases the prisoners, Chronotis revealed as Salyavin with Skagra extracting his mind and turning the prisoners and Chris into his thralls. Reminded that the Universal Mind contains a copy of his brain, the Doctor builds a telepathy helmet to wrestle control from Skagra while the Krarg are destroyed. Skagra ends up a prisoner in his own ship while the Doctor returns the restored prisoners to Shada and parts ways with Chronotis, musing over Chronotis' exploits being exaggerated while expecting a similar treatment within two centuries.

==Production==
Originally, writer [[Douglas Adams]] presented a wholly different idea for the season's six-part finale, involving the Doctor's retirement from adventuring. Facing resistance from producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]], Adams chose to avoid work on a replacement, under the expectation that time pressures would eventually force the producer's hand and allow his idea to be used. Ultimately, however, Williams forced Adams to conceive a new story as a last-minute replacement, which became ''Shada''.

Under its original remit, Graham Williams intended the story as a discussion about the death penalty, specifically how a civilisation like the Time Lords would deal with the issue, and treat its prisoners.&lt;ref name=shannonsullivan&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/5m.html
|title= Shada
|publisher = A Brief History of Time Travel
|last = Sullivan
|first = Shannon
|date = 7 August 2007
|accessdate = 27 March 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As composed by Adams, the story was scheduled to span six 25-minute episodes. Location filming in [[Cambridge]] and the first of three studio sessions at [[BBC Television Centre]] were completed as scheduled;&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; however, when the scheduled second studio block was due to start, it fell foul of a long-running technicians' dispute at the BBC.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt; The strike was over by the onset of rehearsals for the third recording session, but ultimately the studio time was redirected to other higher-priority Christmas programming, leaving the serial incomplete.&lt;ref name="Ley" /&gt; 

Following the departure of Graham Williams from the producer role, attempts were made by new producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] to remount the story; for various reasons, however, this never transpired. Consequently, in June 1980, the production was formally dropped. It is estimated that only 50% of the story was filmed.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;

After the production halt, Adams expressed a low opinion of the script and was content to let it remain obscure, turning down offers to adapt the story in various forms. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the script's 1992 release (accompanying the serial's [[VHS]] reconstruction), it had been amongst a pile of papers sent over by his agent, and that he was unaware of what he was agreeing to.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

In 1983, clips from ''Shada'' were used in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the 20th-anniversary special. [[Tom Baker]], the fourth actor to play the Doctor, had declined to appear in the special, and the plot was reworked to explain the events in the clips.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt;

===Cast notes===
[[Denis Carey (actor)|Denis Carey]] was subsequently cast as the [[eponymous]] Keeper in Tom Baker's penultimate story, ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981), and also appeared as the Borad's [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] in ''[[Timelash]]'' (1985).

==Reconstruction==

===1992 VHS reconstruction===
A decade after the serial's abandonment, John Nathan-Turner set out to complete the story in a fashion, by commissioning new effects shots and a score, and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing scenes. The resulting shortened episodes (of between 14 and 22 minutes each) received a 111-minute VHS release in 1992. In its UK edition, the VHS was accompanied by a facsimile of a version of Douglas Adams's script.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; The release was discontinued in the UK in 1996.

This VHS reconstruction, the 2003 [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]]/Big Finish adaptation and the 1994&lt;!-- Please note "Thirty Years in the Tardis" aired in 1993, then new material was added to that documentary and it became "More Than Thirty Years in the Tardis" which was released in 1994, so the number here is correct --&gt; documentary ''More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2012/05/dwn030512103008-dvd-update-summer.html |title=DVD Update: Summer Schedule |publisher=Doctor Who News |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, were re-released together on DVD on 7 January 2013, as ''The Legacy Collection'' (UK) or simply ''Shada'' (North America).

===Big Finish audio play and web animation (2003)===
In 2003, the BBC commissioned [[Big Finish Productions]] to remake ''Shada'' as an audio play which was then webcast&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcwebcasts" /&gt; in six episodic segments, accompanied by limited [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, on the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC website]] using illustrations provided by comic strip artist [[Lee Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="LeeSullivan" /&gt; The play starred [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] and [[Lalla Ward]] as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]], on 10 December 2005 (as a 2{{1/2}}-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor's summer season, which began on 16 July 2006.

The webcast version (originally broadcast via BBCi's "Red Button") remains available from the BBC ''Doctor Who'' "classic series" website, and an expanded audio-only version is available for purchase on CD from Big Finish. This expanded version was the one broadcast on BBC7.

====Production====
Tom Baker was originally approached to reprise the role of the Doctor, but declined. The Eighth Doctor was then substituted and the story reworked accordingly.

Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked by [[Gary Russell]] to make the story fit into ''Doctor Who'' continuity. This included a new introduction, and a new explanation for the Fourth Doctor and Romana being "taken out of time" during the events of ''The Five Doctors''; the [[Eighth Doctor]] has come to collect Romana and K9 because he has begun to have a feeling that there was something they should have done at that time.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

When Skagra is investigating the Doctor, clips from three other Big Finish productions can be heard, exclusively on the CD version – ''[[The Fires of Vulcan]]'', ''[[The Marian Conspiracy]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria (Doctor Who audio)|Phantasmagoria]]''. The original serial was to have used clips from ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (1978), ''[[The Power of Kroll]]'' (1978–79), ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' (1979), ''[[The Androids of Tara]]'' (1978), ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), and ''[[City of Death]]'' (1979).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Outside references====
In Episode 2 of the webcast version, when Chris is in his lab showing Clare the book, a vending machine-like object in the background is labelled "Nutrimat", a reference to a similar device in Adams' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Two other references are a sequence where Skagra steals a [[Ford Prefect (car)|Ford Prefect]] and when images of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' characters appear as inmates on Shada itself.

===Ian Levine animated version (2011)===
In 2010, [[Ian Levine]] funded an unofficial project to complete the original ''Shada'' story using animation and the original voice actors, minus Tom Baker and David Brierley, to complete the parts of the story that were never filmed. [[John Leeson]] would replace Brierley as the voice of K9, and Paul Jones (better known as a studio carpenter)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name |id=nm2458850 |name=Paul Jones (XXVI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; would replace Tom Baker as the Doctor.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; The completed story was finished in late 2011 and announced by Levine, via his Twitter account, on 8 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burk" /&gt; J. R. Southall, writer for the science fiction magazine ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'', reviewed Levine's completed version and scored it 10 out of 10 in an article published on 15 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Southallreview" /&gt; The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites over two years later, on 12 October 2013.

Elements of the story were reused by Douglas Adams for his novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of Professor Chronotis who possesses a time machine. Adams did not allow ''Shada'', or any of his other ''Doctor Who'' stories, to be novelised by [[Target Books]]. It is, therefore, one of only five serials from the 1963–1989 series not to be novelised by Target – along with Adams' other stories ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' and ''[[City of Death]]'', plus [[Eric Saward]]'s two [[Dalek]] stories (''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'').

A six-part adaptation of the story by Jonathan V Way appeared in issues 13–18 of ''Cosmic Masque'', the [[Doctor Who Appreciation Society]]'s fiction magazine. Adams granted permission for the adaptation on condition that it was never published in collected form.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;

[[BBC Books]] published a novelisation of this serial on 15 March 2012, written by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]]. Roberts drew on the latest versions of the scripts available, as well as adding new material of his own to "fix" various plotholes and unanswered questions.&lt;ref name="Berriman" /&gt; [[Nicholas Pegg]], in his review of the book for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' heartily praised it, calling it a "successful duet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pegg|first=Nicholas|date=4 April 2012|title=The DWM Review: Shada|magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=445|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio book====
Lalla Ward delivered an 11hr 30min unabridged reading of the Gareth Roberts novelisation for [[AudioGo]]; joining her, voicing K9, was John Leeson. The audio recording was released on 15 March 2012, and is available for download or on 10 CDs (CD {{ISBN|978-1-4458-6763-2}}, Download {{ISBN|9781445867656}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiogo.com/doctor-who-shada |title=Doctor Who: Shada Audiobook on Audio CD, Audio Download, buy now from |publisher=AudioGO |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vanessa Bishop reviewed it favourably for ''Doctor Who Magazine'', singling out Simon E Power's sound design for special praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Bishop|first=Vanessa|date=30 May 2012|title=The DWM Review: Shada|magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=447|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]], and [[Keith Topping]] gave the serial (at the time in the form of the 1992 VHS reconstruction) a mixed review in ''[[The Discontinuity Guide]]'' (1995), saying; {{cquote|'I dunno, nowadays they'll publish anything.' Infamous because it was never completed, it was for a long time stated that 'Shada' would have been the highlight of the seventeenth season. What was filmed doesn't quite encourage such optimism. It's a very cheap looking story, and there are lashings of bad puns and dull comedy, including three takes on the 'One lump or two?/Sugar?' joke. Against that, the basic plot is interesting – almost justifying its six episodes, which is rare – and the Cambridge scenes, though stilted, are well executed. It's hugely flawed, but it's a shame that this one was clobbered by a strike and '[[The Creature from the Pit]]' wasn't.&lt;ref name=Discontinuity /&gt;}}

Patrick Mulkern reviewed the 2017 partially reconstructed version for ''[[Radio Times]]''.  Mulkern thought that despite "pockets of magic to enjoy" it was a "sprawling but far-from-epic serial." The humour was repetitive and fell flat and the action pedestrian.  Mulkern recommended Gareth Roberts' novelisation as a superior alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mulkern |first1=Patrick |title=Tom Baker returns in Shada but is this lost Doctor Who still a plodder? |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-07-25/tom-baker-returns-in-shada-but-is-this-lost-doctor-who-still-a-plodder/ |publisher=''[[Radio Times]]'' |date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symbolist movement''' in [[Romania]], active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, marked the development of [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] in both [[Literature of Romania|literature]] and [[Art of Romania|visual arts]]. Bringing the assimilation of [[France]]'s [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Decadent movement|Decadence]] and [[Parnassianism]], it promoted a distinctly urban culture, characterized by [[cosmopolitanism]], [[Francophilia]] and endorsement of [[Westernization]], and was generally opposed to either rural themes or [[Patriotism|patriotic]] displays in art. Like its [[Western Europe]]an counterparts, the movement stood for [[idealism]], [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]] or [[exoticism]], alongside a noted interest in [[spirituality]] and [[esotericism]], covering on its own the ground between local [[Romanticism]] and the emerging [[modernism]] of the ''[[fin de siècle]]''. Despite such unifying traits, Romanian Symbolism was an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], factionalized and often self-contradictory current.

Originally presided upon by poet and novelist [[Alexandru Macedonski]], founder of ''[[Literatorul]]'' magazine, the movement sparked much controversy with its stated disregard for established convention. The original circle of Symbolists made adversaries among the [[Conservatism|conservative]] ''[[Junimea]]'' club, as well as among the traditionalist writers affiliated with ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' review and the [[left-wing]] [[Poporanism|Poporanists]]. However, Romanian Symbolism also radiated within these venues: sympathetic to ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[art for art's sake]] principles, it also communicated to [[Neo-romanticism|neoromantic]] sensibilities within the traditionalist clubs, and comprised a [[Socialism|socialist]] wing of its own. In parallel, the notoriety of Macedonski's circle contributed to the development of other influential Symbolist and post-Symbolist venues, including [[Ovid Densusianu]]'s ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'' and [[Ion Minulescu]]'s ''[[Revista Celor L'alți]]'', as well as to the birth of artists' clubs such as ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]''. The latter category of Symbolist venues helped introduce and promote the aesthetics of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Vienna Secession]], [[post-Impressionism]] and related schools.

Before and during [[World War I]], with the birth of magazines such as ''[[Simbolul]]'' and ''[[Chemarea]]'', the modernist current within Symbolism mutated into the [[avant-garde]] trend, while the more conservative Symbolist circles made a return to [[Neoclassicism]]. Other manifestations of Symbolism, prolonged by the ideology of [[Eugen Lovinescu]]'s ''[[Sburătorul]]'' review, continued to play a part in Romanian cultural life throughout the [[interwar period]].

==Early Symbolism==

===Origins===
[[File:Le Vaisseau fantôme Macedonski L'Élan littéraire.PNG|thumb|260px|One of [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s poems, in ''[[L'Élan Littéraire]]'' (1885)]]
The ground for Parnassianism and Symbolism in Romania was prepared by the Romania public's introduction to the poetry and essays of [[Charles Baudelaire]]. One participant in this process was the French author [[Ange Pechméja]], exiled for his opposition to the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], who settled in [[Bucharest]] and published what is purportedly the first article on Baudelaire to have been circulated in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eiland, Michael W. Jennings, notes to [[Walter Benjamin]], "Central Park", in ''The Complete Works of Walter Benjamin, Volume 4: 1938-1940'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.197.  {{ISBN|0-674-01076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest echoes from within the country were found among the ''Junimists'': as early as the 1870s, the club's magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' published several works by Baudelaire, translated from [[French language|French]] by [[Vasile Pogor]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.8"&gt;Cernat, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these texts had echoes in ''Junimist'' literature. Active later in the decade, poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] probably accommodated some Symbolist themes into his own Romantic and [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] works, most notably in his 1872 novel ''[[Poor Dionis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Junimea'' poet [[Veronica Micle]] (Eminescu's lover) may also have assimilated the nostalgia typical of French Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUaug9.html "Valeria Micle Sturdza"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of contact stood at the core of ''Junimist'' theory, where the group's doyen, [[Titu Maiorescu]], had placed the concept of "art for art's sake", stating his opposition to the [[didacticism]] endorsed by his various rivals while aligning himself with [[Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics|Schopenhauerian aesthetics]] and other constructs of [[German philosophy]]. This approach also showed Maiorescu's appreciation for the artistic principles of [[United States|American]] poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who was a direct influence on the French Symbolists or Parnassians—the ''Junimist'' philosopher had in fact read Poe's theoretical essays, "[[The Poetic Principle]]" and "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]", in a French-language translation signed by Baudelaire.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.75-76; Ornea, p.52, 54&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maiorescu generally ignored and at times expressed a strong rejection of French-inspired modern literary schools, either Parnassian or Symbolist.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.412-413, 437, 685. See also: Ornea, p.53, 117, 301-304; Vianu, Vol. II, p.45-46, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such contacts, the earliest form of native Symbolism emerged from the mainstream, non-''Junimist'', Romantic tradition. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argues that the Symbolist movement's later evolution reflected an original clash of ideas, between the "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], conservative and [[Germanophile]]" nature of ''Junimism'' and the "revolutionary, cosmopolitan, [[Progressivism|progressivist]] and Francophile" position of Romanian Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the Romantic school in Romania's southern area of [[Wallachia]], [[Alexandru Macedonski]] provoked scandal by openly challenging the dominance of ''Junimist'' figures. One such ill-famed campaign focused on Eminescu, who was coming to be recognized as Romania's [[national poet]], and who stood for political conservatism, [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric]] traditionalism, [[ethnic nationalism]] and the direct influence of [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/rivalul_lui_eminescu "Rivalul lui Eminescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.230, 242, 407, 412, 520-521, 683; Cernat, p.10-11; Vianu, Vol. II, p.243, 351-360, 379, 387; Vol. III, p.353-356&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to these incidents, critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] noted: "Actually, with the incompatibility between Maiorescu and Macedonski, between ''Junimea'' and the Macedonskian club, a border is traced [...] separating the 19th century from the 20th."&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; While Eminescu's approach still evolved within the limits set by ''Junimea'', it served to inspire a large number of non-''Junimist'' traditionalists, whose didacticism, shaped by [[Populism|populist]] values, was hotly opposed by Macedonski and his followers.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.556-559, 643, 683; Cernat, p.14-15; Sandqvist, p.60-62, 197, 200, 202, 281. See also: Braga, p.16; Șotropa (2009), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conflicts were aired by means of Macedonski's Bucharest-based ''[[Literatorul]]'' review. Initially a purely anti-''Junimist'' platform hosting contributions from aging Romantic writers ([[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], [[V. A. Urechia]] etc.), it closed down several times and eventually reemerged as the main platform of early Romanian Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.515-543; Vianu, Vol. II, p.243, 351-393, 387-389, 398, 418-419, 420, 472-473, 483; Vol. III, p.355-356, 384-386. See also: Ornea, p.137, 233, 301-304, 308-309; Suciu, p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt; The circle had among its representatives a number of Macedonski's young disciples and colleagues, themselves more or less influenced by the aesthetics of Decadence and Symbolism: [[Th. M. Stoenescu]], [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu]], [[Caton Theodorian]], [[Carol Scrob]], [[Dumitru Karnabatt]], [[Mircea Demetriade]], [[Donar Munteanu]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523, 531-532, 594-597, 701-702, 719; Vianu, Vol. II, p.351, 359-360, 373-374, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's own participation in Symbolism had an international character. It dates back to the mid-1880s, when his French-language poems were first published in French or [[Belgium|Belgian]] Symbolist periodicals (''[[La Wallonie]]'' and ''[[L'Élan Littéraire]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11-12; Sandqvist, p.197; Suciu, p.104, 109; Vianu, Vol. II, p.362; M. Vida (2007), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgactiv"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Gulea, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=410 "Activ, retroactiv"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, the Romanian writer made repeated efforts to consolidate his reputation as a European Symbolist and enhance the profile of his ''Literatorul'' group, publishing his [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'' in [[Paris]] and establishing personal contacts with French and [[Francophone]] authors.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190-191, 245; Cernat, p.11-12, 42, 88-89, 184, 402; Sandqvist, p.199-200, 240; Suciu, p.106-107; Vianu, Vol. II, p.369-371, 376-379, 381, 420, 436-448, 467-472; Vol. III, p.352-353&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism between Macedonski and Petică===
[[File:Constantin Jiquidi - Un poet simbolist.JPG|thumb|260px|"The Symbolist poet", as portrayed by cartoonist [[Constantin Jiquidi]]. At the bottom, a stack of papers with the title ''[[Literatorul]]'']]
Analyzing the overall eclectic nature of the movement originating with ''Literatorul'', Mihai Zamfir concluded: "on Romanian territory, all currents united themselves into a synthetic 'newism' ".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.12"&gt;Cernat, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, literary historian [[Mircea Braga]] argued that Romanian Symbolism was more a state of mind than a program, its theses being "numerous and often imprecise".&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; In line with these developments, the Symbolist milieus had as a shared focus their admiration for the [[French Third Republic|Third French Republic]], and for Paris as ''la Cité des Lumières'' ("the City of Lights").&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 17, 59. See also: Boia, p.61, 102-103, 190-191, 235, 245-246; Sandqvist, p.119, 120, 197-200, 203, 240, 302; Șotropa (2009), p.38-39; Suciu, p.102, 103-110&lt;/ref&gt;

As another unifying element in their post-Romantic opposition to the traditionalists and their advocacy of national specificity, the emerging Symbolists generally valued cosmopolitan [[individualism]] and cultivated [[exoticism]]. In this context, [[Dimitrie Anghel]] attracted critical praise with elaborate fantasy prose and floral-themed [[lyric poetry]], rich in Decadentist and eccentric imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.302, 563, 603, 652, 683, 687-691, 750-751, 832, 835, 845, 858, 864, 960; Cernat, p.11, 18-19, 73, 351&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the fold of regular Symbolism, but directly inspired by [[François Coppée]], [[Haralamb Lecca]] delved into macabre subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.592&lt;/ref&gt; More frequently, the choice of exotic subjects was modeled on Macedonski's poems, and fed by echoes of the [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|major explorations]], which were becoming familiar news in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Anghelescu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Calatoriile-intre-literatura-si-viata-reala*articleID_15039-articles_details.html "Călătoriile, între literatură și viața reală"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 312, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ispinzele"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Toate-pinzele-sus*articleID_372-articles_details.html "Toate pînzele sus!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 100, January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This fashion was notably illustrated by [[Iuliu Cezar Săvescu]], who sang the deserts and the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref name="ispinzele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.686&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Karnabatt and his wife [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt|Lucrezzia]] took Symbolism to the realm of [[travel writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], "Dimitrie et Lucrezzia Karnabatt: voyages symbolistes", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.95-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Bovarysme|Bovaryist]]" and "[[snob]]bish" tendency, Cernat notes, was what made many members of the movement seek to acquire for themselves an urban identity which clashed with the rural ideal and the religious mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15-19&lt;/ref&gt; One other defining trait, which endured as a distinct tradition within Romanian Symbolism, was Macedonski's interest in alternatives to established religion, primarily manifested by his [[Esotericism|esoteric]] studies, and taken up by his disciples Karnabatt, [[Alexandru Petroff]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 17. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p.372-373, 386, 389, 430&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandru Obedenaru]].&lt;ref name="sfmasa"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Șerban Foarță]], [http://www.romlit.ro/masa_intelectualilor "La masa intelectualilor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 38/2003&lt;/ref&gt; In later manifestations of Symbolism and Decadentism, this interest merged itself with a stated or implicit preference of other affiliates for [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]] in front of the majority religion, [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17, 42&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these ideas were also inspiring the Romanian-born aristocrat [[Charles-Adolphe Cantacuzène]], who was debuting as a poet in France, and who borrowed his mystical subjects from the Symbolist doyen [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;Houssais, p.33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification with France came together with respect for the declining local aristocracy, the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]], whom some of the Romanian Symbolists preferred over both the peasant majority and the competitive [[Capitalism|capitalist]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.16, 18, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; It became a component of a larger Symbolist [[counterculture]]: several members of the movement, Macedonski included, found inspirational value in [[social alienation]] and individual failure, driving some of them to sympathize with the [[proletariat]] and the urban [[underclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.515-516, 523-524, 561-563, 652, 685, 697, 702, 706; Cernat, p.18, 51; Vianu, Vol. II, p.389-391, 398-406, 421-422, 480. See also: Ștefănescu, p.308; Suciu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group as a whole was still nominally opposed to the [[Socialism|socialist]] circles of literary theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and his ''[[Contemporanul]]'' review, who primarily advocated a [[working class]] and [[Literary realism|realistic]] version of didacticism.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.545-565, 602, 685; Cernat, p.20; Ornea, p.308-358. See also Sandqvist, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; This gap between was traversed by Macedonski's younger friend, the socialist poet and novelist [[Traian Demetrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.561-563, 685, 697, 719, 726-727. See also: Ornea, p.357-358; Vianu, Vol. II, p.361-362, 377-378, 389, 391, 409, 421; Vol. III, p.285-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski's ideology was itself marked by inconsistency and eclecticism, often allowing for the coexistence of Parnassian and Symbolist opposites, and eventually turning into [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523-529; Cernat, p.11-12, 16; Suciu, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Also attracted into this Neoclassical mix was the poetic work of occasional contributors to Symbolist reviews: [[Panait Cerna]], [[Mihai Codreanu]], [[Oreste Georgescu]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.534-536, 648-653. See also: Ornea, p.263, 303; Vianu, Vol. II, p.366-367, 369, 377, 387, 390-391, 418-419, 463, 465-467; Vianu, Vol. III, p.353-354, 386-387&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest internal restructuring of Romanian Symbolism occurred in 1895, a moment of effervescence in literary history. At the time, ''Literatorul'' was facing financial difficulties, its role being supplanted by a large number of magazines (''[[Revista Contimporană]]'', ''Revista Literară'', ''Revista Olteană'', ''Revista Orientală'', ''Révue Franco-Roumaine'' etc.), most of them  gravitating around Macedonski's circle.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 40&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liga Ortodoxă'', a new magazine launched by Macedonski during the interval, published the first-ever contributions by young poet [[Tudor Arghezi]], later one of the most acclaimed figures in Romanian letters.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.808; Cernat, p.8, 15, 29; Vianu, Vol. II, p.369; Vol. III, p.475-476&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure among Macedonski's disciples to establish himself shortly after 1900 was poet and critic [[Ștefan Petică]], originally a socialist influenced by Dobrogeanu-Gherea.&lt;ref name="mzpetica"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/tefan_petic__suavul_vistor "Ștefan Petică – suavul visător"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.685&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted for his attempts to set up contacts abroad, Petică was especially known for his overall erudition and his familiarity with [[English literature]], with which came a stream of [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[Aestheticism|Aestheticist]] influences into Romanian Symbolist poetry and prose.&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cǎlinescu, p.685-686; Cernat, p.12, 15, 16; Șotropa (2009), p.39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the programmatic articles published by him in 1899 and 1900 do not clarify his exact relationship with Symbolism, his 1902 volume ''Fecioara în alb'' ("The Virgin in White") was described by researchers as the first product of mature Symbolism in Romania,&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.15"&gt;Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Solii păcii'' ("The Messengers of Peace") is rated as the first Symbolist work in [[Theater of Romania|Romanian drama]].&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt;

The turn of the century saw the Symbolist affiliation of [[George Bacovia]], who published the first poems of what became, in 1916, the ''[[Plumb (Bacovia)|Plumb]]'' volume—inaugurating a period in his work centered on the sentimental depictions of acute alienation, sickness and suburban monotony.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.561-562, 702, 706-709, 821, 824, 844, 944; Cernat, p.15, 16, 23, 319-320; Sandqvist, p.208; Șotropa (2009), p.40; Vianu, Vol. III, p.383-391&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1904 also marked Arghezi's emancipation from Macedonski's school and the start of his search for an individual approach to Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.10, 16-22, 24; Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Directly inspired by Baudelaire, the young writer circulated the first poems in the ''Agate negre'' ("Black Agates") cycle and began editing his own periodical, ''Linia Dreaptă''.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.10, 16-22; Călinescu, p.678, 683, 687, 808; Cernat, p.15, 29, 56, 304; Vianu, Vol. III, p.478-479&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tinerimea Artistică'', Symbolism and Art Nouveau==

===Birth of ''Tinerimea Artistică''===
[[File:Nicolae Petrescu-Găină - Tinerimea Artistică, Zeflemeaua, 1903.JPG|thumb|300px|Some of the ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' founders, in a caricature by [[Nicolae Petrescu-Găină]] (1903)]]
The same interval brought the first explicit manifestations of Symbolism in [[Art of Romania|local visual arts]]. The second half of the 1890s witnessed the birth of opposition to [[academic art]] under the guidance of Macedonski's associate, poet, political agitator and art patron [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], who set up an organization based on the French ''[[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 42. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Bogdan-Pitești, together with [[Ioan Bacalbașa]] and [[Ștefan Ciocâlteu]], founded ''Ileana'', an international art society dedicated to the promotion of new art currents.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.42-43. See also: Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168; Juvara, p.74, 75, 76; Sandqvist, p.59; M. Vida (2007), p.55-56; Vianu, Vol. II, p.370; Vlasiu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''Ileana'' financed and advertised the arrival to Bucharest of [[Joséphin Péladan]], a French Decadentist writer and [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] mystic.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.42-43, 407. See also: Șotropa (2009), p.45; Vianu, Vol. III, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; After 1900, the ''Ileana'' group began publishing an eponymous art magazine, the first one of its kind in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; but was undecided about which style Romanian art should follow.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168; Juvara, p.75; Sandqvist, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1890s saw the worldwide emergence of [[Art Nouveau]] as a Symbolist art form, challenging the popularity of [[Impressionism]]. The indirect impact of [[Vienna Secession]] was major, even outside the realm of visual arts, prompting literary historian [[Ștefan Cazimir]] to suggest the existence of a Secession period in local letters during the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.12"/&gt; Connections with French Symbolist aesthetics were being preserved, in Paris itself, by sculptor, actor and lawyer [[Constantin Ganesco]]&lt;ref&gt;Houssais, p.29-33&lt;/ref&gt; and, with noted success, by the [[Greeks in Romania|Greek Romanian]] painter and printmaker [[Michel Simonidy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Badea-Păun, "Michel Simonidy, la tentation d'une carrière parisienne", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.103-118. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.171&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors of the 1970 overview ''Pictura românească în imagini'' ("Illustrated Romanian Painting"), a new Art Nouveau school was born around 1900: "The predilection for Symbolist imagery, for the plant-like ornament, especially the floral one, for the decorative [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]], for the matte [[pastel]] in brushwork techniques, are all [...] stylistic traits characteristic for this visual aesthetics, which was not fully developed in our country, but which was symptomatic in what regards the creation [...] of a new art climate".&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, the innovating aesthetics were first promoted by means of ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' society. Created in 1901, it reunited artists familiarized with both France's Art Nouveau scene and the Secession phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.59-60; Șotropa (2009), p.37-38; M. Vida (2007), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Ileana'', ''Tinerimea'' was still frequented by mainstream conservatives, and, art historian [[Tom Sandqvist]] argues, only radicalized itself after 1905—the year when it became home to both the post-Impressionist [[Camil Ressu]] and the Secessionist [[Dimitrie Hârlescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, art historian Mariana Vida notes, the society was stylistically undecided, but its members tended to display the same Symbolist psychology: "the Symbolist artist is a decadent, swept over by ''[[Wiktionary:morbidezza|morbidezza]]'' and [[eroticism]], persuaded by suffering, despising the [[bourgeois]] life. Jewels, shiny stones, exotic flowers [...], perfumes, obscurities and spectral lights emphasize themes that appeal to the senses and a piercing [[synesthesia]]."&lt;ref name="M. Vida 2007, p.57"&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.57&lt;/ref&gt; She also argues: "In the case of visual arts, the problem of defining Romanian Symbolism remains up for debate, given the stylistic complexity of this phenomenon, the interferences of Art Nouveau aesthetics and a strong local color, the result of the tastes and mentalities of an area located at the Gates of the Orient."&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Ipostaze-ale-modernismului-%28I%29*articleID_22882-articles_details.html "Ipostaze ale modernismului (I)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 503, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tinerimea'' and official art===
[[File:Ștefan Luchian - Primavara.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Ștefan Luchian]], ''Primăvara'' ("Spring")]]
The blending of Symbolism and traditional art remained a characteristic of ''Tinerimea'' art. [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], the academic Impressionist, was the respected ''Tinerimea'' forerunner, his status serving to moderate the Symbolist influence. However, according to some interpretations, Grigorescu's last works also bordered on Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; A major figure among the ''Tinerimea'' group was [[Ștefan Luchian]], whose canvasses and pastel drawings hesitate between Grigorescu's Impressionism, Art Nouveau and original research into new techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167, 168, 173-179; Juvara, p.75, 77; Pavel, p.73, 76, 83, 86-87, 97; M.

The aging ''Tinerimea'' mentor [[George Demetrescu Mirea]] mainly worked with academic subjects, which critics have described as grandiloquent and stale,&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.164-166, 171&lt;/ref&gt; but allowed himself to be influenced by the French Symbolists.&lt;ref name="msriècle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/un_pictor_fin_de_sicle "Un pictor fin de siècle"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although he and Verona were lionized by the traditionalists for their main contributions (idyllic and Grigorescu-like),&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167, 170, 172&lt;/ref&gt; Mirea's pupil [[Ipolit Strâmbu]] also steered toward Symbolism in some of his portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.74, 76; M. Vida (2007), p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Initially trained in academic painting, [[Constantin Artachino]] veered toward Symbolism when seeking inspiration in the [[fairy tale]].&lt;ref name="M. Vida 2007, p.57"/&gt; Some Symbolist echoes were also identified in the canvasses of [[Gheorghe Petrașcu]] and [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]], as well as in the engravings of [[Gabriel Popescu (graphic artist)|Gabriel Popescu]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.59, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The echoes of Symbolism and Secession were also present in the works of ''Tinerimea'' sculptors [[Oscar Späthe]] and [[Friedrich Storck]], both of whom were also inspired by the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Munich Academy]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.74, 75, 77; Șotropa (2007), p.21-23; M. Vida (2007), p.61; Teacă, p.68, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Constantin, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Visuri-si-himere*articleID_21773-articles_details.html "Visuri și himere"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 474, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Späthe, who earned his peers' recognition as the leading Romanian Secessionist, was inspired to create works which blended the [[Byzantine revival]] or a set of tributes to the ''[[Quattrocento]]'' into a Secession setting, his example being closely followed by Storck.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.21-23&lt;/ref&gt; The echoes within Romanian sculpture were still minor, since, critics have noted, Romanian sculpture itself was underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2009), p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tinerimea''{{'}}s international ambitions also brought it into contact with European Symbolists, some of whom exhibited in Bucharest: [[Gustav Gurschner]], [[Henri-Jean Guillaume Martin]], [[Carl Milles]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.78; M. Vida (2007), p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; At home, Späthe's intercession&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt; gave Romanian Symbolism its official sponsor, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]] (the future [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen-Consort]]), an admirer of the Art Nouveau phenomenon in general. She was famously the owner of a large Art Nouveau collection at her [[Pelișor Castle]] in [[Sinaia]], where she gathered the prints of [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Henri Privat-Livemont]] etc., as well as [[decorative art]] drawn in her own hand.&lt;ref name="asisublimul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Adrian-Silvan Ionescu]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/sublimul-art-nouveau-3100497/ "Sublimul Art Nouveau"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', March 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Marie's taste, and her features, inspired the works of Romanian Symbolist sculptors into the next decade;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.21, 25&lt;/ref&gt; her daughter [[Ileana of Romania]] was herself an amateur artist and writer, also won over by the Art Nouveau fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1900 generation of painters and decorative artists stimulated the gradual incorporation of Art Nouveau into the vocabulary of modern [[Romanian architecture]]. In this context, the Symbolist legacy was often adapted into an allegorical expression of [[nationalism]] and [[historism]], with the Bucharest group sometimes known as ''Arta 1900'' ("Art of 1900").&lt;ref&gt;Barend, p.88-89; Sandqvist, p.58. See also Vlasiu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The style called ''[[Neo-Brâncovenesc]]'' (or "Neo-Romanian"), which assimilated the Art Nouveau guidelines, was announced by [[Anghel Saligny]] and later taken up by [[Ion Mincu]].&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"&gt;{{ro icon}} Virgil Mihaiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/arhitectur_art_nouveau_din_romnia_n_premier_la_lisabona "Arhitectură Art Nouveau din România în premieră la Lisabona"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The merger of decorative styles in [[handicraft]]s received enthusiastic support from ethnographer [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], and was adapted into the mural paintings of [[Abgar Baltazar]] and [[Ștefan Popescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu, ''passim''. See also: Juvara, p.74, 76, 77; M. Vida (2007), p.59-60, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

''Neo-Brâncovenesc'' or pure Art Nouveau played an important part in remodeling the urban landscape, in Bucharest as well as in the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Constanța]] (where [[Petre Antonescu]] and Frenchman [[Daniel Renard]] designed the [[Constanța Casino]]).&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"/&gt; This urban renaissance also enlisted contributions from [[Nicolae Ghica-Budești]], also known as a Secession [[interior design]]er,&lt;ref&gt;Barend, p.89; Sandqvist, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion D.

==Symbolist expansion==

===Regional branches===
The reaction against parochialism and traditionalism was strengthened by the diffusion of Symbolism and Decadentism into other the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s provincial areas, as well as by the steady influx of disappointed [[middle-class]] provincials into Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16-17, 59, 203-204; Vianu, Vol. II, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and Symbolist promoter [[Constantin Beldie]] recorded in his memoirs the arrival into the capital of "so many young men with their hair grown and with no [[cuff]]s on their shirts", leaving their places of origin "because their parents did not understand them" and motivated by the encouragements "of some literary sheet or another, that would eventually be dragged down into the murky waters of journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The fascination of provincial Romanian adolescents with the poetic themes of Symbolism was later documented (and criticized) in the novel ''[[La Medeleni]]'', by the traditionalist [[Ionel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Angelo Mitchievici]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MEDELENIiul8.html "''La Medeleni'': hotarul nevăzut"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to definitions from both within and without the Symbolist movement, there followed a structuring of Symbolism along the cultural priorities or characteristics of [[Historical regions of Romania|historical regions]]: an extrovert and suggestive school, heralded by Macedonski himself, in the southwestern province of Wallachia; and a [[Melancholia|melancholic]] branch to the north and east, in [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16-17, 37-38, 52; Vianu, Vol. III, p.386-388&lt;/ref&gt; The "Wallachians", primarily judged as exponents of an artistic approach, are Macedonski, Demetrescu and [[Ion Pillat]], alongside [[Alexandru Colorian]], [[Elena Farago]], [[Barbu Solacolu]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; Of special note among the Symbolists emerging from Wallachia, [[Al. T. Stamatiad]] was a cherished disciple of Macedonski, who left flowery erotic verse and, in succession to Petică's Aestheticism, [[prose poem]]s loosely based on those of [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523, 686, 701-702, 858&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum, the early representatives of "Moldavian" Symbolism include Petică, Bacovia, Anghel, [[Gabriel Donna]], [[Alfred Moșoiu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]] and [[Alexandru Vițianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 21; See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.386-388&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], the spread of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]] in general was helped along by "a certain insurgent fever of souls brought up in small Moldavian ''[[târg]]uri'' and exasperated by their somnolent atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.16"&gt;Cernat, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat also asserts: "The dramatic lessening in administrative importance of [[Iași]]—Moldavia's former capital—generated a strong feeling of frustration among local intellectuals".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.16"/&gt;

A distinct product of "Moldavian" Symbolism was the Iași-based review ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'', founded in 1905 by the aspiring academic [[Ovid Densusianu]], and published until 1925. Critics have suggested that Densusianu's image of Symbolism was rather complex and its agenda still eclectic: ''Vieața Nouă'' harbored a group of authors with distinct Neoclassical traits, who treasured [[free verse]] as a puristic form of poetic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.8; Călinescu, p.683-685; Cernat, p.16, 20-22, 31, 56, 61, 94-95, 297, 402&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical was characterized not just by an advocacy of urban and [[Westernization|Westernized]] culture, but also by a strong interest in the common heritage of [[Romance languages]] and tendencies toward [[Pan-Latinism]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683-684; Cernat, p.20-21, 297; Vianu, Vol. III, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; with Densusianu calling into question the traditionalist notion that Romanian purity was only preserved in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"&gt;Sandqvist, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieața Nouă'' frequently published translations of modern French authors, from [[Remy de Gourmont]] and [[Marcel Proust]] to [[Paul Claudel]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also enlisted the participation of Densusianu's disciples in the field of literary criticism, within Moldavia and elsewhere: [[D. Caracostea]], [[Pompiliu Păltânea]] and [[Petre Haneș]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683, 710-711; Cernat, p.61. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.130-131, 134-140&lt;/ref&gt; With that, the influence of "academic" Symbolism stretched into Romania's new province of [[Northern Dobruja]], where poet [[Al. Gherghel]] was stationed.&lt;ref name="gvsase"&gt;{{ro icon}} Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/ase_poei_uitai "Șase poeți uitați"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Densusianu's academic current is seen with some reserve by researchers, who argued that its followers were only accidentally Symbolist, and primarily advocates of conventional approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Densusianu was more a Francophile than a Symbolist, and, as an immigrant from [[Transylvania]] (at the time in [[Austria-Hungary]]), out of touch with "the spirit of the new school."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.683"&gt;Călinescu, p.683&lt;/ref&gt; In Cernat's view, Densusianu's "tastelessness" and "narrow dogmatism" were a downgrading factor within the Symbolist environment, indirectly contributing to a schism between the Neoclassical and innovative sides of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.21, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Although noted by the traditionalists as a most polemical magazine&lt;ref name="Chendi, p.63"&gt;Chendi, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhat successful in its competition with ''Junimea'',&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.11, 16, 246, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieața Nouă'' remained a minor addition to the literary landscape, with very low circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sămănătorist'' reaction and 1908 revival===
Especially after 1905, the Symbolist trend was faced with a stronger reaction from the traditionalist and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] camp, headed by the new literary magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]''. Through historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was for a while its leading exponent, this circle instigated the public against Francophilia and cosmopolitanism, to the point of organizing the large-scale nationalist riots held in front of the [[National Theater Bucharest]] (1906).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.353; Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga found Symbolism trivial, calling it "''[[Lupanar (Pompeii)|lupanarium]]'' literature",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adina-Ștefania Ciurea, [http://www.romlit.ro/scriitori_n_boxa_acuzailor "Scriitori în boxa acuzaților"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2003&lt;/ref&gt; while, in critic [[Ilarie Chendi]], the traditionalist magazines found a vocal adversary of Macedonski's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.639; Teacă, p.68; Vianu, Vol. II, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Sămănătorul'' cultivated its own [[Neo-romanticism|neoromatic]] branch of the Symbolist current, which Cernat described as a sign that the conservative segment of Symbolism was also emancipating itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The Symbolist-''Sămănătorist'' wing was notably represented by two of the magazine's leading contributors: [[Ștefan Octavian Iosif]] and his friend Dimitrie Anghel.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601-605, 683-691; Cernat, p.16-19, 21, 73; Ornea, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Anghel's collaboration with Iosif took the for of a literary duo, a significant product of which was the neoromantic drama ''Legenda funigeilor'' ("Gossamer Legend", 1907).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.597, 665, 689-691; Cernat, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sămănătorul'' also opened itself to contributions from other authors formed by Symbolism, from Petică and Stamatiad&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601; Cernat, p.18-19, 21&lt;/ref&gt; to Farago and [[Alice Călugăru]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.681, 702-705. See also Cornis-Pope, p.232, 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at that stage, first-generation Symbolism in general was becoming more accepted by the cultural establishment, engendering some mutations at the movement's core. In contrast to their teacher Macedonski, several Romanian Symbolists were adopting neoromantic attitudes and viewing Eminescu's poetry with more sympathy, treasuring those Eminescian traits which were closest to Decadentism (idealism, moroseness, exoticism).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 21, 26, 27, 209, 211, 227. See also: Braga, p.9, 16; Marian, p.112-113&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, more radical traditionalist ideologues such as Iorga continued to view the current with alarm: in 1905, Iorga notably used ''Sămănătorul'' to state his dislike for Anghel's floral-themed poetry, which he believed was suited to "boyar" tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; On a more intimate level, Petică, seen by Mihai Zamfir as "the most Eminescian Romanian poet",&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt; was developing an original ethno-nationalist interpretation of art, infused with [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.685; Cernat, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, a Symbolist core was defining itself as the [[Elitism|elitist]] alternative to the ''Sămănătorul'' [[populism]].&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ion_minulescu "Ion Minulescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 51-52/2003&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908, poet [[Ion Minulescu]] was becoming the new herald of Romanian Symbolism, or, according to George Călinescu, its "most integral exponent".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.691&lt;/ref&gt; Minulescu's ascendancy was nevertheless synonymous with the movement's decline, inaugurating a mutation into the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, ''passim''; Cernat, p.8, 15-17, 21-29, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; His short-lived periodical, ''[[Revista Celor L'alți]]'', was notorious for publishing the manifesto ''Aprindeți torțele!'' ("Light Up the Torches!"), viewed by critics as either the first explicitly Symbolist document of its kind or the earliest voice of the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 15, 25-26, 97; Sandqvist, p.202-203&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested to the readers that the "literary present" needed to be "lit up", claiming to align itself with those "young people who have the courage of tearing themselves from the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto went on to explain Minulescu's take on artistic revolution: "[Young people] can only view the past with respect. They reserve their love for the future. [...] Liberty and individuality in art, the preservation of old forms acquired from their elders, the tendency in favor of things new, quaint, bizarre even, only extracting the characteristic parts out of life [...] and only focusing on things that set one man apart from another. [...] If literary tradition finds a revolutionary color on such flagpoles, so be it—we accept it!"&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; Sandqvist summarizes the general objective as: "Art must create something new in any case, always and everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism meets Futurism and Expressionism===
Minulescu's moment of glory was unusual in its European context. Paul Cernat, who interprets ''Aprindeți torțele!'' as a Symbolist work inspired by the ideas of French cultural critic [[Remy de Gourmont]], notes that, despite the movement's goal of reaching simultaneity with [[Western culture]], the moment of its publication came twenty years after France's original ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 25-27, 97&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Cernat also notes, international Symbolism was falling behind the more vocally [[anti-establishment]] expressions of modernism: [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Futurism]] etc., several of which were coming to describe the older movement as effeminate and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 12-14, 21-23, 83-95, 97&lt;/ref&gt; As in [[German-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]], the Art Nouveau scene of Romania was acting as a catalyst for the new Expressionist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.428; Pavel, p.75-78, 83-89&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that Romanian Symbolism was belated to the point of anachronism is supported by other commentators. George Călinescu wrote: "[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]], the Parnassians and the Symbolists were only discovered in our country almost a century after their emergence [in France]."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.683"/&gt; According to Sandqvist: "The Romanian context is characterized by the fact that the Romanian writers did not synchronize their symbolism with the contemporary, academicized phase of French symbolism, but went straight to the sources and sought out none other than [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], Baudelaire, Verlaine, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[Eugen Negrici]] reacts against the "illusion" according to which Romanian Symbolism announced the modernist phenomenon, while also arguing: "When, around 1900, French Symbolism was exhausted as a recipe, the Romanian one was just about getting born. Its flowering at roughly the same time as modern European poetry was configuring its typology is what has been leading us to proclaim its modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Eugen Negrici]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=33&amp;nr=371 "Iluziile literaturii române"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-1908 effort of synchronization with the European scene was a conscious one on the part of some Romanian Symbolists. Citing previous verdicts, linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu suggests that the period saw poets moving closer to the practice of Symbolism, overcoming the mainly theoretical and post-Romantic phase of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Sandqvist reports: "Contemporary writers and intellectuals, as well as 'ordinary' readers, were shocked as much by the [''Revista Celor L'alți'' group's] disillusioned, sarcastic, and bizarre way of handling lyrical motifs with the help of, for instance, intertwined sounds, colors, and scents, as by their choice of subject matter, where the city parks, the streets, and the buildings are inhabited by prostitutes, criminals, the insane, and [[erotomania]]cs and where hospitals, restaurants, cathedrals, and palaces play a prominent role as 'scenes of the crime.' Everything anguished, neurotic, macabre, bizarre, exotic, unusual, theatrical, grotesque, [[elegiac]], light-hearted, sensuous, dripping, and monotonous was celebrated as well as everything trivial, everyday, tedious, and empty, at the same time as the poets were borrowing freely from world literature, blending images and metaphors, motifs, and atmospheres."&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"/&gt;

Minulescu's columns in ''Revista Celor L'alți'', like his parallel articles for ''[[Viitorul]]'' daily, popularized the works of Symbolist and post-Symbolist writers, from Rimbaud, [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Albert Samain]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]] to [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.26-27. See also: Sandqvist, p.170, 202-203, 237; Ștefănescu, p.306; Șotropa (2009), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, ''Revista Celor L'alți''{{'}}s choice of name (literally, "the others' magazine") indicated a break with Densusianu's version of Symbolism, although the ''Vieața Nouă'' doyen still contributed to Minulescu's review.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1908, ''Vieața Nouă'' had published Densusianu's influential praise of free verse poetry, ''Versul liber și dezvoltarea estetică a limbii literare'' ("Free Verse and the Aesthetic Development of the [[Literary language|Literary Language]]").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.15"/&gt; In particular, news about the spread of Futurism divided local writers: Densusianu's skepticism&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; was overshadowed by the indignation of [[Dumitru Karnabatt]]. The latter, who would subsequently become a contributor to traditionalist papers,&lt;ref&gt;Chendi, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; suggested at the time that all the Futurists were insane.&lt;ref name="ipviitor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_viitor_de_o_sut_de_ani "Un viitor de o sută de ani"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist bohemians===

Minulescu's own poetry of the period was noted for its insolent and flamboyant language, its urban themes and its inspiration from [[Romance (music)|romanzas]]—all characteristics attributed by critics to the Wallachian tradition within Symbolism.&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.658, 691-697, 702, 814, 832, 835, 842-843, 930, 938; Cernat, p.15, 16, 17, 22-29, 31, 65, 87-88; Sandqvist, p.170, 202-209, 237, 374; Vianu, Vol. III, p.374-382&lt;/ref&gt; Its success with a middle class feminine public was reportedly devastating;&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt; it also unusually earned Minulescu the respect of a leading ''Junimea''-bred satirist, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22; Sandqvist, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; noted earlier for his derision of Macedonskian Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui "Nimeni nu poate sări peste umbra epocii lui"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2009; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177, 184, 188, 366, 373-376, 387&lt;/ref&gt;

In Minulescu's time, the Symbolist movement began cultivating a [[Bohemianism|bohemian society]], which in turn rested on Romania's older [[coffee culture]]. Its use of [[coffeehouse]]s as informal clubs consequently became at once a mark of Romanian Symbolism and a characteristic of early 20th century literary life.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.692, 694, 695; Cernat, p.15, 17, 22-23, 51, 137, 203-204; Sandqvist, p.118, 120-121, 130, 197, 203-204; Vianu, Vol. III, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt; The Symbolists' example in this respect was taken up by traditionalist authors: the two currents soon after faced each other on a daily basis, debating lively in Bucharest establishments such as ''[[Casa Capșa]]'', ''[[Kübler Coffeehouse|Kübler]]'' and ''[[Terasa Oteteleșanu]]''.&lt;ref name="sfmasa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 16, 17, 44, 51, 91; Sandqvist, p.118, 120-121, 130, 197, 203-204. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.208&lt;/ref&gt; The two camps were however united by professional interest, and together created the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], which became functional in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAapr8.html "Secolul breslei scriitoricești"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant event occurred in 1912, when Macedonski made his return from an extended stay in [[Paris]]. His cause charmed the younger poets, among whom [[Ion Pillat]] and [[Horia Furtună]] became his dedicated promoters and publicists.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.380-381; Vol. III, p.350-355&lt;/ref&gt; The late Symbolist period was especially important for Pillat and Furtună, whose poems adhere closely to the models set by Macedonski (in Pillat's case, with an emphasis on exoticism).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.727, 857-861; Vianu, Vol. III, p.350-361&lt;/ref&gt; Pillat's Symbolist debut also had an international aspect: familiarized in Paris with the French Symbolist and Parnassians, he translated their work at home, presided over an "Academy of the 10" while in France, and later authored definitive anthologies of Symbolist poetry.&lt;ref name="cpvolupt"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Pillat, [http://www.romlit.ro/voluptatea_lecturii "Voluptatea lecturii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/1999. See also Balotă, p.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; Pillat's colleague [[Tudor Vianu]], who spoke about his own affiliation with Ovid Densusianu's Symbolism in 1913, described the cultural significance of renewed debates: "Romanian Symbolism was a chapter in the permanent ''[[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns|querelle des anciens et des modernes]]''. We [Symbolists] were inspired by the idea that modern life may enter the universal synthesis of art and that, once he rises above the archaism and traditionalism of consecrated literary models, a poet must test himself on the road toward those subjects that characterize the life and the civilization of his own age."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.128-129&lt;/ref&gt; The informal faction, regrouped around Macedonski, Davidescu and Stamatiad, was soon joined by [[Alexandru Dominic]], [[Oreste Georgescu]], [[Adrian Maniu]] and [[Marcel Romanescu]];&lt;ref name="cpvolupt"/&gt; those who also followed Densusianu included Vianu, [[Alexandru Colorian]], [[Anastasie Mândru]] and several other young poets.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.127-129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left-wing contacts===
In the wake of Romania's [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 Peasants' Revolt]], Symbolism was consolidating its links with the [[left-wing]] movements, which were at the time recovering from the split of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] into several small groups. The leftist representatives of Symbolism were finding new allies among the scattered socialist circles and setting up connections with [[Poporanism]], the leftist version of traditionalism. Such contacts were built on Arghezi's collaboration with socialist activist [[N. D. Cocea]] and the left-leaning writer [[Gala Galaction]] (later known as a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] theologian), who had started their relationship while working on ''Linia Dreaptă'', moving on to create ''[[Viața Socială]]'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' and then on a succession of short-lived papers.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.678, 681, 808; Cernat, p.8, 18, 22, 23, 29-32, 34-35, 39, 44, 61-75, 90, 98, 313, 402; Vianu, Vol. III, p.278-280, 315, 479-481. See also Chendi, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The mix of Symbolists and socialists was described as ineffectual by the traditionalist witness Chendi, who, in 1912, argued: "Mr. Cocea wanted to break through and resorted to our young Decadents and Symbolists in Bucharest, who nevertheless, having not one thing in common with the doctrines of socialism, could not pay as much service to the magazine [''Viața Socială''] as to prevent from going under, in explicable manner."&lt;ref name="Chendi, p.63"/&gt;

In Cocea's case, this opening toward [[modern art]] was motivated by his generic interest in cultural innovation, explained by him as a wish to surpass both "antiquated artistic formulas" and "the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.8"/&gt; His own literary contribution, only partly connected with Decadentism, was often in the [[Erotic literature|explicitly erotic genre]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Arghezi, who had by that moment embarked on and forfeited a career in Orthodox monasticism, was beginning to merge influences from Symbolism with traditionalist and avant-garde [[poetics]], into a new original format.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.9-34, 48, 71, 73, 75-76, 84, 112; Călinescu, p.51, 589, 658, 690, 694, 808-819, 826, 866, 868, 870, 875, 879, 884, 903, 906-907, 942, 944; Cernat, p.8, 9, 15, 21-22, 34, 48, 53, 56-57, 77, 122, 123, 139-141, 148-150, 184, 203, 207, 273, 275-277, 299, 321-322, 334-336, 339-340, 344-345, 349, 351; Sandqvist, p.4, 130, 234, 374; Vianu, Vol. II, p.451; Vol. III, p.359, 394, 484-503&lt;/ref&gt; His disappointment with the Church experience was by then also manifested in his search for an alternative [[spirituality]], his vocal [[anticlericalism]] and his interest in [[Christian heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.27-34; Călinescu, p.809-814, 816, 818-819, 911, 929; Cernat, p.15, 17-18, 141, 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

A promoter of both Decadentism and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], Gala Galaction was affiliated with the main Poporanist venue, ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.678-681; Cernat, p.8, 34; Vianu, Vol. II, p.367, 369; Vol. III, p.274-295&lt;/ref&gt; The latter magazine, occupying the middle ground between Dobrogeanu-Gherea's socialism and ''Sămănătorism'', was generally opposed to art for art's sake, but had its own separate links with the Symbolist environment. These reached to the top of its editorial board: the publication's ideologue and co-founder [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] sympathized with its [[lyricism]], and, like various other writers from the Poporanist schools, adopted Decadent themes in his own works of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.19, 20, 21, 29-32, 34, 90. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.95-07&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, the review also hosted one of the first scholarly studies of Symbolism to be produced in Romania, the work of woman critic [[Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.20, 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively after that date, the Poporanist circle opened itself toward those representatives of Symbolist poetry who had parted with Densusianu's branch, upholding Arghezi as a major Romanian author.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.21-22, 30. See also Chendi, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided exposure to distinct representatives of feminine Symbolist poetry, illustrated there by Alice Călugăru or Farago.&lt;ref&gt;Cornis-Pope, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the aesthetic implications of Ibrăileanu's traditionalism and ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s cooperation with the governing [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] drew criticism from the more radical Cocea.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, another distinct link with leftist politics was preserved through the [[Proletarian literature|proletarian-themed school]] of Symbolist poetry, inaugurated by [[Traian Demetrescu]] and later illustrated by Bacovia, [[Mihail Cruceanu]], [[Andrei Naum]], [[Alexandru Toma]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 18&lt;/ref&gt; This wing of Symbolism, together with the Arghezi-Galaction tandem, also enjoyed close relationships with some advocates of [[Social Realism]], among them [[I. C. Vissarion]] and [[Vasile Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17, 29, 30, 74-75, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist climate and modern art venues===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Lux in tenebris lucet.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], ''Lux in tenebris lucet'', 1909]]
The literary mutation was echoed in local modern art, where the currents emerging from [[post-Impressionism]], [[Synthetism]] and Fauvism were being slowly acclimatized. This transition was in large part owed to graphic artist [[Iosif Iser]], known for his adversity to Secession art, but also for his contributions to the [[German Empire|German]] ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]''&lt;ref name="plsbrittany"/&gt; and his borrowings from Art Nouveau cartoonists like [[Thomas Theodor Heine]] and [[Félix Vallotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Iser organized a Bucharest exhibit of works by French-based modernists [[André Derain]], [[Jean-Louis Forain]] and [[Demetrios Galanis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15-16, 25, 46, 407&lt;/ref&gt; Also famous as the illustrator of Minulescu and Arghezi,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; he progressively incorporated the newer artistic styles into his personal palette—resulting in what some have called "Iserism".&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt; Like many other artists and writers, he frequented Bogdan-Pitești's newly founded Bucharest club or the artists' colony his patron had set up in [[Colonești, Olt|Colonești]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.39, 43-44, 402, 405-406, 407&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], there emerged a pattern of anti-Symbolism among Romanian painters, including those who studied with French Symbolist teachers.&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8939 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (IV)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 2, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandrescu writes that Romanian art students were "opaque to both the symbolic substance and the decorative efflorescence that so enthused the Paris of their formative years", only preserving from this environment a love for the "[[picturesque]]".&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"/&gt; Art historians have traditionally placed the moment of rebellion in visual arts in or around 1910, when ''Tinerimea Artistică'' finally split into traditionalist-classical Symbolist wing and a modernist one.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-46, 156; Juvara, p.77-79; Sandqvist, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; The period also witnessed the arrival into art criticism of Symbolist poet [[Theodor Cornel]]. Although he died a young man in 1911, Cornel is credited with having introduced Romanians to the [[Primitivism|primitivist]] and exotic tendencies of post-Impressionism, and to have been among the first authoritative critics in the country to discuss such new phenomena as Cubism or [[Abstract art|Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-47. See also: Grigorescu, p.430; Pavel, p.72-74&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes in competition with the Moldavian Expressionist painter [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]].&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.183-184&lt;/ref&gt; This context produced the first works by Romanian primitivists: [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], [[Friedrich Storck]], [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], and, foremost among them, sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.46-47, 340, 398; Sandqvist, p.184. See also Pavel, p.74-75, 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this group, Brâncuși did not generally follow the Symbolist guidelines, and instead reached international fame with an original semi-abstract modernist style influenced by [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 46-48, 157, 199, 212, 224-225, 238-239, 311, 324, 331, 392, 398, 404, 409; Grigorescu, p.26, 134, 408-409; Juvara, p.78-79; Pavel, p.81, 97-98; Sandqvist, p.184, 249-251, 255, 351, 353; Vanci, p.216-217. For the Symbolist roots of Brâncuși's art, see also: Șotropa (2007), p.22, 23-24; Matei Stîrcea-Crăciun, "La dimension symboliste de la sculpture brancusienne. Étude de cas: ''Le Baiser''", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.83-88; Vlasiu, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion also discarded all forms of Symbolism by the end of the decade, and incorporated into his art the solid shape painting of [[Paul Cézanne]],&lt;ref name="mvlola"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Intre-tensiunile-expresionismului-si-noul-umanism*articleID_14558-articles_details.html "Între tensiunile expresionismului și noul umanism"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 300-301, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while Cuțescu-Storck was still a classical Symbolist in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.63; Teacă, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; With draftsman [[Ary Murnu]], she contributed Art Nouveau illustrations to the ''Tinerimea'' catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.56, 66&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911, ''Tinerimea'' had also received into its ranks the painter [[Theodor Pallady]], whose debut works were dominated by Symbolist imagery,&lt;ref name="msriècle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.63; Teacă, p.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; but who was later a prominent anti-Symbolist.&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

The new generation of Romanian Symbolist artists also included several sculptors who, like Brâncuși, trained with French master [[Auguste Rodin]]: [[Horia Boambă]], [[Teodor Burcă]], [[Anghel Chiciu]], [[Filip Marin]], [[Ion Jalea]], [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], [[Alexandru Severin]].&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.23-26&lt;/ref&gt; Boambă earned a short-lived notoriety with works contrasting delicate figures with rough surfaces, while Marin alternated academic busts with Symbolist statuettes.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt; A poet as well as sculptor, Severin was close to Alexandru Macedonski, with whom he founded ''Cenaclul Idealist'' ("The Idealist Club"), also including painters [[Alexis Macedonski]], [[Leon Alexandru Biju]] and [[Dimitrie Mihăilescu]].&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt; His sculptures, notably exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1908, displayed his interest in the mysterious or expressed his admiration for Rodin.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The young Paciurea was mainly adapting Rodin's Impressionist themes to the Romanian historist school, and only later became a truly Symbolist artist.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Insula'' and ''Simbolul''===
[[File:Alexandru Szathmary - Interior oriental.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alexandru Satmari]], ''Interior oriental'' ("Oriental Interior", 1916), with a portrait of [[Claudia Millian]]]]
Since shortly before the [[Second Balkan War]] and continuing down to [[World War I]], local Symbolism experienced other more radical mutations into the avant-garde. Paul Cernat suggests that this interval brought into existence a "Symbolism of the independents" or "people's Symbolism", opposed to Densusianu's version but indebted to "Minulescianism", to Bacovia and to Arghezi.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; The new expression of Romanian Symbolism, Cernat also notes, was playful, theatrical and centered on the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'', receiving post-Symbolist influences not just from Expressionism and Futurism, but also from [[Imagism]], [['Pataphysics]] or ''[[Zutisme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23, 26-32, 50-54, 61-75, 88-93, 95, 341, 402&lt;/ref&gt; As the inventor of Futurism and propagandist of the new artistic credo, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] maintained close links with Romanian intellectuals, efforts which notably brought him into contact with Alexandru Macedonski.&lt;ref name="dgactiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.88-89; Sandqvist, p.200, 235-245, 383&lt;/ref&gt;

These new tendencies made an impact on the work of established figures within the Symbolist movement. Minulescu began infusing his original Symbolist style with borrowings from more radical modernists, becoming one of the few Romanian authors of the 1910s to incorporate elements of Futurism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8-9, 26-29, 87-88, 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; and introducing some Expressionist techniques in his works for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.696. Braga, who denies Minulescu's Symbolism and sees him as a [[Neo-Romanticism|neoromantic]], also notes that some of his poetry is the literary equivalent of paintings by [[Paul Gauguin]] (p.11-12).&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Bacovia modified his own style by appropriating characteristics of Expressionist poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.9; Cernat, p.23, 71. See also Grigorescu, p.373, 416&lt;/ref&gt; Among the new representatives of this trend were the innovative poet [[Adrian Maniu]] and his younger emulators, [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. All of them, in varying degrees, owed inspiration to the innovative Symbolism of Laforgue, whose hallmark poetic motif, that of the hanged man, they each reworked into tribute poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Maniu parted with Symbolism almost immediately after this stage, and the form of post- and anti-Symbolist [[experimental literature]] he generated helped to inspire similar moves on his colleagues' part.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.702, 708, 822-824, 838, 888, 896, 907; Cernat, p.50-54, 72, 91, 97, 119, 143-144, 325, 341, 397-398, 412, 887, 896-897; Grigorescu, p.413-415; Sandqvist, p.75, 128-130, 166, 170, 244-245, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in spring 1912, Minulescu's new review ''Insula'' consecrated some of these developments. In Cernat's view, the new publication surpassed ''Revista Celor L'alți'' in both radicalism and public exposure.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.27"&gt;Cernat, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted contributions by poet and critic [[N. Davidescu]], who clarified the magazine's position in a series of articles, postulating a difference between Decadentism (seen as a negative phenomenon and identified as such with traditionalism) and Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, his texts spoke about Futurism as having some "absurd and useless parts", and being overall monotonous.&lt;ref name="ipviitor"/&gt; Davidescu's own poetry of the period modernized borrowings from Baudelaire, Macedonski and [[Paul Verlaine]], exploring the exotic and the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.697-698&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle of ''Insula'' affiliates notably included Bacovia, Beldie, Cruceanu, Dragoslav, Karnabatt, Ștefănescu-Est, Vițianu, and (on his literary debut) Maniu.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.27"/&gt; They were joined by [[Șerban Bascovici]], [[D. Iacobescu]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Mihail Săulescu]], [[Theodor Solacolu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Dem. Theodorescu]] and Minulescu's wife [[Claudia Millian]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27-28, 65, 104&lt;/ref&gt; These authors illustrated a diversity of approaches within the Symbolist milieu. Many preserved the fascination with the exotic, from Ștefănescu-Est's colorful depictions of imaginary lands to Săulescu's dreams of solitary [[atoll]]s, whereas Isac's version of Symbolism created unconventional lyrical pieces, mostly noted for their Imagism and their ironic twists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.700-702, 710&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on decorative and artificial subjects was also preserved by Millian, in works which often depict scenes of seduction,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.835&lt;/ref&gt; and by Sperantia, who found his niche on the margin of Parnassianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Minulescu's cheerfulness and in agreement with the Moldavian wing of the Symbolist movement, Iacobescu wrote sad poems reflecting his losing battle with [[tuberculosis]], and gained a following among young Romanian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.709-710; Cernat, p.65; Vianu, Vol. III, p.86-91&lt;/ref&gt; Other than these writers, the ''Insula'' group played home to [[Nae Ionescu]], the future [[far right|far-right]] philosopher—at the time a cultural promoter with Futurist and [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27, 28, 40-41, 51, 95, 137, 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the same year, Vinea, Tzara and graphic artist [[Marcel Janco]]—all still high school students at the time—began publishing ''[[Simbolul]]'' magazine. This new Symbolist and post-Symbolist tribune received contributions from Minulescu, from his ''Insula'' group, and even from Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51; Sandqvist, p.75, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other contributors were [[Poldi Chapier]], [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Barbu Solacolu]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]] and [[George Stratulat]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-51, 90, 99-100. See also Sandqvist, p.72-78&lt;/ref&gt; Especially through the articles of Maniu and Emil Isac, the paper made a point of shunning convention, rekindling polemics with the traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-50; Sandqvist, p.75-77, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; Janco, together with Iser, Maniu and Millian, provided the illustrations for the few issues ''Simbolul'' published before closing down in December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's new socialist magazine, ''[[Facla]]'', signified the start of collaborations between the leftist activists and various of the ''Simbolul'' contributors. Illustrated by Iser, the magazine enlisted Vinea as a literary columnist—inaugurating the adolescent poet's parallel evolution into an opinion journalist with socially radical views.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30, 61-75, 92-94, 97-108, 132-134, 131-145, 148, 205-208, 403&lt;/ref&gt; Rebelling against traditional, [[Positivism|positivist]] criticism, the young author made sustained efforts to familiarize his public with aesthetic alternatives: [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s poetry, Gourmont's essays, the theoretical particularities of [[Russian Symbolism]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.61-75, 92-94, 100-101, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eclectic magazines===
[[File:Înşir'te mărgărite, Oradea, 1926.JPG|thumb|310px|Amateur actors in costume for a performance of ''[[Înșir'te mărgărite]]'' ([[Oradea]], 1926)]]
A product of Densusianu's school, the Iași-based magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' grouped various of Densusianu's admirers: [[I. M. Rașcu]] (the publication's founder), Cruceanu, Sperantia, Stamatiad, Vițianu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684-685; Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rașcu and Cruceanu favored a delicate Symbolism individualized by exotic settings (Cruceanu) or [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] devotion (Rașcu).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.705-706&lt;/ref&gt; ''Versuri și Proză'' nevertheless gave positive coverage to Futurism,&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; hosting contributions from Arghezi, Bacovia, Macedonski and Minulescu alike,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684; Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from more rebellious modernist authors and new wave Symbolists—including articles by its co-editor Hefter-Hidalgo, pieces by Maniu and the first-ever works signed by [[F. Brunea-Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34, 55, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt; The publication also registered the debut of [[Perpessicius]], later known as a poet and critic with Symbolist sensibilities,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55, 313&lt;/ref&gt; and the early lyrical works of [[Nicolae Budurescu]] and [[Dragoș Protopopescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, others who followed Densusianu's principles went on to create provincial versions of ''Vieața Nouă'': ''Farul'', ''Sărbătoarea Eroilor'' and Stamatiad's ''Grădina Hesperidelor''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.31, 64, 97, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolists like Minulescu or Arghezi also found unexpected backing from the conservative ''Junimist'' [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] and his disciple [[Ion Trivale]], [[art for art's sake]] advocates who allowed such works to be published in their ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 21-22, 31, 34. See also Călinescu, p.643-644&lt;/ref&gt; Their literary club was also home to Stamatiad, [[Anastasie Mândru]], [[I. Dragoslav]] and other young men who admired Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.379-380&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude, Cernat suggests, was linked to Dragomirescu's personal preference for [[Richard Wagner]]'s theories on music, which showed a predisposition for modernism, and which had led him into a debate with his former mentor Maiorescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, art historian Adriana Șotropa notes that both Dragomirescu and Trivale promoted an individual form of Aestheticism,&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2009), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; while Dragomirescu biographer Adrian Tudorachi assessed that ''Convorbiri Critice'' and the Symbolists shared a love for "interiority" in literary expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Cistelecan, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna107.pdf "Dincolo de canon"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 107, February 2007, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such points of contact, Trivale was mostly noted for his overall rejection of Symbolist literature,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.644&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Convorbiri Critice'' circle endured as a permanent target for ridicule on the part of young modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.7-8, 63&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Junimist'' figure, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], opened his paper ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' to contributions from various figures in the Symbolist and modernist field. The conservative venue notably published Tzara's early poems, Cocea's art chronicles, the pro-Symbolist articles of novelist [[Felix Aderca]] and various pieces by the ''Simbolul'' group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 30-31, 34, 46, 47, 51, 54, 61, 89-91, 102-103, 108, 109, 308, 402, 408. See also: Călinescu, p.683; Chendi, p.63; Sandqvist, p.126, 196, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-''Junimist'' magazines were joined in this context by [[Constantin Banu]]'s eclectic review, ''[[Flacăra]]'', itself noted for circulating the writings of young Symbolists and post-Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.713, 808; Cernat, p.23, 32, 54, 61, 107-108, 213; Vianu, Vol. II, p.382; Vol. III, p.383&lt;/ref&gt; One new voice emerging from its circle was [[Victor Eftimiu]], whose work in drama was largely a neoromantic adaptation a [[fairy tale]] format, with the genre conventions introduced by [[Edmond Rostand]] (''[[Înșir'te mărgărite]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.713-716&lt;/ref&gt; His other contributions in verse moved between the extremes of Neoclassical reworkings of [[Greek mythology]] and sentimental Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.688, 716-719, 722, 727, 837&lt;/ref&gt; Also affiliated for a while with ''Flacăra'', where he made his debut as a poet, [[Tudor Vianu]] later turned to a career in literary history, and was especially noted for the moderation of his views.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.912-913. See also: Balotă, p.256-269; Vianu, Vol. III, p.127-133&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such critical inclusivism, the Symbolist movement profited from the intercession of established journalists with Symbolist credentials: Beldie, Cocea and Pillat, all of whom promoted it within the mainstream press.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 30-31, 408&lt;/ref&gt; The environment hosted poet [[Barbu Nemțeanu]], whose version of Symbolism generally followed an "[[Intimism|intimist]]" perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; alternating with humorous depictions of provincial life.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.709&lt;/ref&gt; Another poet in this succession was [[Luca Caragiale]], whose work stood for a cosmopolitan reinterpretation of urban [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.710&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-cultural Symbolism and ethnic enclaves===
[[File:Hans Bulhardt - Female figure, drawing, 1907.JPG|thumb|150px|Ink drawing by [[Hans Bulhardt]] (1907)]]
A distinct milieu to participate in the post-Symbolist transition was that of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian]] writers and artists, a category to which Iacobescu, Nemțeanu, Aderca, Brunea-Fox, Hefter-Hidalgo, Iser, Janco and Tzara all belonged. Traditionally seen by various critics as a coagulating factor for the emerging avant-garde, to which they purportedly contributed their ideal of eluding ''[[shtetl]]'' culture, their protest in favor of [[Jewish Emancipation|political emancipation]], and their [[Secularism|secularist]] graft of [[Jewish philosophy]], these figures were received with interest by the left-wing Symbolists, who militated for cultural pluralism and social integration.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.32-38&lt;/ref&gt; Originally writing in the line of "Moldavian" Symbolism and Arghezi, to which he attached the influence of his [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] roots and [[bucolic]] echoes from Romanian traditionalism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 15, 16, 17, 34, 36-38, 56, 65, 98, 132, 135, 139-140, 143, 149, 153, 201, 203-204, 208-209, 211-213, 222-223, 226-227, 269, 271-274, 286-289, 292, 299, 307-308, 310, 324, 336, 398, 405-406, 408, 409, 410, 412, 413; Grigorescu, p.418-420&lt;/ref&gt; poet and critic [[Benjamin Fondane|Benjamin Fondane (Fundoianu)]] became a leading exponent of this process. Over the late 1910s also, his writings incorporated echoes from Expressionism, announcing his eventual presence at the forefront of Romania's avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36, 274; Grigorescu, p.418-420. See also Sandqvist, p.354-355&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before World War I erupted on Romania's border, the Iași modernist environment witnessed the journalistic debut of two Jewish intellectuals, each of them owners of a literary review with Symbolist and leftist agendas who declared their allegiance to Arghezi: [[Eugen Relgis]] (''Fronda'') and [[Isac Ludo]] (''Absolutio'').&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34, 55-57, 97, 98, 99, 402, 412&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, a Jewish and [[Zionism|Zionist]] application of Art Nouveau, directly inspired by the art of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] lithographer [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], was developed in drawing by [[Reuven Rubin]] (whose paintings of the time experimented with primitivist aesthetics).&lt;ref&gt;Milly Heyd, "The Uses of Primitivism: Reuven Rubin in Palestine", in Ezra Mendelsohn (ed.), ''Art and Its Uses: The Visual Image and Modern Jewish Society. Studies in Contemporary Jewry, Vol. VI'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford etc., 1990, p.61-64.  {{ISBN|0-19-506188-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism also covers an early period in the career of [[Lola Schmierer Roth]], the [[Galați]]-born Jewish artist.&lt;ref name="mvlola"/&gt;

Located at the time in Austria-Hungary, the regions of [[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]] were largely inhabited by [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian people]], but, before the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|1918 political union]], were virtually untouched by Romanian Symbolism. Despite the Transylvanian origins of Densusianu, Iosif or Emil Isac, and the massive circulation of French Symbolist texts by the Romanian newspapers of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Blaj]] (''Românul'', ''Unirea''),&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p.307&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of Symbolism among the Romanians on the northern slope of the [[Carpathians]] remained minor, and the appeal of traditionalist literature in such communities was virtually unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601-602, 683-685; Cernat, p.19-20, 50; Chendi, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Some Symbolist echoes were captured in the poems of [[Octavian Goga]], editor of the traditionalist paper ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.610-611; Sandqvist, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the paintings of [[Octavian Smigelschi]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vida, p.37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of interest was contrasted by the region's [[Hungarians|Magyar]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] [[intelligentsia]], which assimilated international Art Nouveau and, more distantly, Symbolism as vehicles of national revival, in line with the architectural work of [[Ödön Lechner]]. In some of the Transylvanian urban centers, including [[Baia Mare|Baia Mare (Nagybánya)]], [[Oradea|Oradea (Nagyvárad)]], [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj (Kolozsvár)]], [[Târgu Mureș|Târgu Mureș (Marosvásárhely)]] and [[Timișoara|Timișoara (Temesvár)]], the public commissioned Art Nouveau buildings from major architects, such as Lechner and [[Otto Wagner]].&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"/&gt; Among the [[German language|German]]-speaking Transylvanian Saxons and the Romanians, an early Symbolism was promoted by [[Hans Bulhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Popica, [http://tara-barsei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/popica2007.pdf "Tradiție și inovație în arta transilvăneană – cazul pictorului brașovean Hans Bulhardt"], in ''Țara Bârsei'', Nr. 6/2007, p.151-159; G. Vida, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvanian contributors to Symbolism and post-Symbolism in [[Hungarian art]] or [[Hungarian literature|literature]] include polymath [[Károly Kós]] and some early members of the [[Baia Mare School]] of painting.&lt;ref name="lb27-37"&gt;[[Leon Botstein]], "Out of Hungary: Bartók, Modernism and the Cultural Politics of Twentieth-Century Music", in Péter Laki (ed.), ''Bartók and His World'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton &amp; Chichester, 1995, p.27-37.  {{ISBN|0-691-00633-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna Secession aesthetics had some influence on several Transylvanian-born Hungarians, from Symbolist poet [[Endre Ady]]&lt;ref&gt;Berend, p.88; Fenyo, p.29-32; Sandqvist, p.55, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and [[20th-century classical music|modern classical]] composer [[Béla Bartók]]&lt;ref name="lb27-37"/&gt; to painters [[Emerich Tamás]], [[Árpád Vida]], [[István Balogh (painter)|István Balogh]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vida, p.37, 40-46. See also Pavel, p.76-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, artist [[János Mattis-Teutsch]] moved between Secession Symbolism, ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' and Abstraction, while also bridging the parallel developments of Hungarian, Saxon and Romanian art.&lt;ref&gt;Vanci, p.217-218.

==Late Symbolism==

===World War I splits and decline===
From late 1914 to early 1916, during the period when Romania conserved its neutrality while World War I raged in neighboring areas, the new Symbolist generation was also radicalizing itself on political grounds, identifying with ideals such as [[pacifism]] and [[proletarian internationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23, 35, 39-40, 63-64, 97-108, 132-135, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; The political message was expressed through a number of publications that were both literary and polemical in nature: Arghezi's ''Cronica'', Bogdan-Pitești's ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' and, most subversively, Cocea's ''[[Facla]]'' and ''[[Chemarea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 30, 31-32, 34-35, 39, 45, 47, 51, 54, 61-75, 92-94, 97-110, 116-120, 132-135, 139-141, 148, 188, 402, 403, 405, 407. See also Sandqvist, p.4, 78, 125-128, 131-132, 170, 196, 244, 348, 355&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was edited by Vinea, and primarily functioned as an avatar of Cocea's political press, surfacing and resurfacing under various names in his attempt to elude wartime [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-108, 132-135&lt;/ref&gt; Its cultural agenda and its move away from Symbolism were however identified by Paul Cernat in the disparate graphic and literary elements: cover reproductions of works by [[Félix Vallotton]]; Tzara's first non-Symbolist poems and Vinea's own "incisive" program; satirical pieces ridiculing [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s new publications and the neo-''Sămănătorist'' current; polemics with the supporters of Romanian Symbolism at ''Vieața Nouă'' and ''Flacăra''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-110, 116-120, 403, 407&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than constituting a voice for the avant-garde, Cernat notes, ''Chemarea'' symbolized a moment when "the Romanian pre-avant-garde plugged itself into the pulse of a European-wide sensitivity touched by the radical crisis of its dominating values."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sandqvist (building on previous assessments from Romanian writer [[Eugène Ionesco]]), discusses the ''Chemarea'' group as a Symbolist faction, borrowing freely from the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.4, 7, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The war scattered and divided the various Symbolist milieus along the larger divide between the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and [[Central Powers]] camps. A significant portion of the movement split with Francophilia, either by campaigning in favor of [[pacifism]] or by rallying with the Central Powers' cause. A notorious case was that of Bogdan-Pitești, by then host to a large circle of protégé writers or artists, who used his position and wealth to advance a [[Germanophile]] ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94-95, 189-195, 203, 342; Cernat, p.34, 39-45&lt;/ref&gt; The old Macedonski, by then disappointed with France and the Francophiles, was also sympathetic to the German cause.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103-104, 246-248; Vianu, Vol. II, p.381-384, 387&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the pro-Entente cause was enthusiastically supported by those Symbolists who still strongly identified with Francophilia: Minulescu, Densusianu, [[N. Davidescu]], [[Victor Eftimiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.61, 74, 78, 102-103, 113, 117, 235. See also: Vianu, Vol. II, p.384; Vol. III, p.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The situation became conflictual after the National Liberal cabinet rallied Romania with the Entente, opening Romania to a [[Romania during World War I|German-led invasion]] and having to take refuge in Iași. Several of the Symbolists and modernists in Bucharest were among those who either continued to support or did not actively reject the Central Powers' administration of Romania, leaving their adversaries in Iași to describe them as [[Collaborationism|collaborationists]]. After the [[armistice with Germany]] of 1918, this charge resulted in the arrest of several Symbolist figures, Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești, Galaction and [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.339-344; Cernat, p.39, 45, 54, 132, 139&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Maniu&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103-105; Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luca Caragiale]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103, 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; maintained links with the occupiers, but avoided prosecution. Cocea, who supported the Entente in the name of Francophile ideals, spent part of the war years in the [[Russian Empire]], where he was won over by [[far left]] ideas shortly before the [[October Revolution]], returning to his country a committed [[Communism|communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar survivals===
The voice of Symbolism was preserved in the writings of some old affiliates who remained active on the literary scene, but also found new adherents. Already known for his Symbolist poetry and stories, [[Mateiu Caragiale]] made a late and critically acclaimed debut in the novel form with ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'', noted for its merger of modernist tone and Decadentist aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.897-900; Cernat, p.16, 53, 81, 148, 184, 207, 351, 352, 397; {{ro icon}} [[Șerban Foarță]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ale_turnurilor_umbre.. " 'Ale turnurilor umbre...' "], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 30/2008; Vianu, Vol. III, p.170-182&lt;/ref&gt; It earned Caragiale a large following, and, as late as 2001, was nominated by a panel of critics "the best 20th century Romanian novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ROMANUL-ROMANESC-AL-SECOLULUI-XX*articleID_3917-articles_details.html "Romanul românesc al secolului XX"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 45-46, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; One of the new Symbolists, [[Camil Baltazar]], preserved the Moldavian tendency, including the elements it shared with the avant-garde, producing a distinctly morose poetry that romanticized [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.52, 325; Grigorescu, p.416&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of similar subjects marked early chapters in the poetry of [[Demostene Botez]]&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.707, 708, 819-822, 824, 832, 844, 859; Vianu, Vol. III, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dimitrie Batova]].&lt;ref name="gvsase"/&gt; In contrast, poets such as [[George Gregorian]], [[Ion Al-George]], [[Perpessicius]] and [[George Talaz]] cultivated Symbolist subjects with Neoclassical touches and elements from the local lyrical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.657-658, 728, 851-854&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets illustrating this new Symbolist tendency were [[Grigore Bărgăuanu]], [[Mihail Celarianu]], [[Dumitru Gherghinescu-Vania]], [[Ion Sofia Manolescu]], [[Virgiliu Moscovici-Monda]], [[I. Valerian]] and [[D. N. Teodorescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.842-845, 944, 960-961&lt;/ref&gt; joined by [[Mihai Moșandrei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_restituire2 "O restituire"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2006&lt;/ref&gt; More or less pronounced echoes from French Symbolism were also present in the work of some poets who were affiliated with ''[[Viața Românească]]''{{'}}s interwar circle: [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], [[Otilia Cazimir]], [[Alexandru Al. Philippide]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.778-779, 832-835, 843. See also: Balotă, p.125-161; Cornis-Pope, p.232; Grigorescu, p.410-411&lt;/ref&gt; In line with these developments, the interwar also preserved a role in mainstream academic criticism for two former Symbolist promoters, Perpessicius and [[Tudor Vianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.18, 149, 151, 153, 298, 313-330, 340, 346-349, 411-412; Ornea, p.25, 102-104, 111, 125, 139, 145, 377. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.470-474&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of [[Greater Romania]] brought late Symbolism into [[Bessarabia]], stimulating the [[Literature of Moldova|Bessarabian literary scene]]. A generation of Romanian-speaking Bessarabian poets embraced Symbolism, in some cases with influences from other forms of modern writing. Particularly relevant in this context, [[George Meniuc]] embraced Symbolist poetry before moving toward Romanian traditionalism.&lt;ref name="abarcadia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Burlacu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/Alexandru%20BURLACUm.htm "Poezia basarabeană: Arcadia în negativ (I)"], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/Alexandru%20BURLACUap.html "Arcadia în negativ (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March–April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itpoezia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Țurcanu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TURCANUiun6.html "Poezia basarabeană din interbelic"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_meniuc "George Meniuc"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of Bessarabian Symbolism, often alongside Expressionism, was encouraged by several literary magazines—a leading presence among them was ''[[Viața Basarabiei]]'', which officially claimed to be a neo-''Sămănătorist'' publication, followed by ''[[Bugeacul]]'', ''[[Poetul]]'' and ''[[Itinerar]]''.&lt;ref name="abarcadia"/&gt; The Symbolist school's representatives in that region were a diverse gathering. Meniuc's way of merging traditionalism with Symbolism and other currents was notably followed by [[Nicolai Costenco]] or [[Alexandru Robot]].&lt;ref name="abarcadia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itpoezia"/&gt; Other authors in this succession are [[Sergiu Grossu]], [[Bogdan Istru]], [[Teodor Nencev]],&lt;ref name="abarcadia"/&gt; [[Eugenio Coșeriu]], [[Liviu Deleanu]] and [[Magda Isanos]].&lt;ref name="itpoezia"/&gt; Late in the 1920s, Romanian Symbolist poetry was also having echoes in [[Albanian literature]], primarily through the work of [[Albanians in Romania|Albanian Romanian]] resident [[Aleksandër Stavre Drenova]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Elsie]], ''Albanian Literature: A Short History'', [[I.B. Tauris]], Centre for Albanian Studies, London &amp; New York, 2005, p.104.  {{ISBN|1-84511-031-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In visual arts, Symbolism still had some interwar followers. ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' survived nominally until 1947, but lost its significance even before 1920.&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.79-80; Șotropa (2009), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of Symbolism was kept alive through a late arrival, sculptor [[Dimitrie Paciurea]]. His work in the 1920s comprised a series of Secession-inspired "[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimeras]]", which earned much critical attention.&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.88-89; Șotropa (2007), p.24, 27; (2009), ''passim''. See also Grigorescu, p.444&lt;/ref&gt; Paciurea reportedly shocked traditionalist sensibilities—an admirer, painter [[Nicolae Tonitza]], wrote that it left "cretin smiles" on the faces of experts.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2009), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; His later work bridged such influences with admiration for [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s poetry and the [[Byzantine revival]] aesthetics.&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alina Skultety, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-8-2008-ii-4730.html "Forme de sculptură modernă"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 961, August 2008; Șotropa (2007), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Ceclia Cuțescu-Storck]] revived Art Nouveau in her historically themed murals and [[stained glass]] work.&lt;ref&gt;Barend, p.89; Drăguț ''et al.'', p.264; Sandqvist, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; In [[decorative art]] as well as in book illustration, Symbolism and Art Nouveau were prolonged well into the 1930s by the work of [[Costin Petrescu (painter)|Costin Petrescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.264&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Beller]],&lt;ref name="asisublimul"/&gt; [[Mișu Teișanu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Tudor Octavian]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/misu-mihai-teisanu-1884-1944-2987392 "Mișu (Mihai) Teișanu (1884-1944)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', February 19, 2003; [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/de_ce_s-a_suparat_ion_barbu "De ce s-a supărat Ion Barbu?"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 10/2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mina Byck Wepper]].&lt;ref&gt;Marian Constantin, "Sur quelques panneaux décoratifs de jeunesse de Mina Byck Wepper", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art.

===Interwar returnees and ''Sburătorul''===
Various critics have discussed the presence of or even return to Symbolism within the avant-garde environment, despite its radicalization as Futurism, [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] or [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. The neutrality years had witnessed a milestone in the history of avant-garde literature, with the activity of [[Urmuz]], an eccentric civil servant whose life ended in public suicide. Urmuz's [[Absurdism|absurdist]] prose, occasionally supported by the [[performance art]] of his actor friend [[George Ciprian]], fascinated the bohemian environment, but was only published with Arghezi's assistance in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.9, 48, 50, 91-92, 131, 156, 180, 181-197, 206, 222, 269, 271, 321-323, 329-335, 339-391, 394, 395, 397, 403, 404-405, 412, 415; Grigorescu, p.423-424; Sandqvist, p.19-22, 209, 218-237, 245, 248, 372, 375. See also Călinescu, p.888-890, 921&lt;/ref&gt; Following a parallel avant-garde trend, Tzara and Janco settled in neutral [[Switzerland]] during the war years, where they contributed to the very invention of Dada. Rallying from Romania with his former ''Simbolul'' colleagues, Vinea stated his affiliation with the radical trends, while remaining an eclectic and overall isolated figure. ''[[Contimporanul]]'', the magazine he founded with Janco upon the latter's return to Romania, moved between radical politics, eclectic Constructivism and praise for Arghezi's poetic synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50-51, 53, 72, 75-81, 83, 116, 120-312, 403-404, 407-413; Grigorescu, p.385, 389, 391-394; Sandqvist, p.217, 345-370&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing at the time, both Vinea and [[Benjamin Fondane]] looked back critically on Romanian Symbolism, describing it as imitative, in whole or in part, of France's model, and as such detrimental to Romanian authenticity or spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.208-209, 408&lt;/ref&gt; Their jargon notwithstanding, ''Contimporanul'' still published the work of authors who urged respect for Symbolism (most notably, the journalist Horia Verzeanu).&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successive avant-garde episodes, Vinea himself preserved a traceable link to Symbolism, which resurfaced in his works of poems and prose until the final years in his life&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.896-897; Cernat, p.75-81, 116-130, 148, 150-151, 180-186, 266-267, 308-311, 351-352, 398, 422; {{ro icon}} Gabriela Ursachi, [http://www.romlit.ro/iulie3 "Iulie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 28/2004; Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/avangarda_napoi "Avangarda înapoi!"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 19/2006&lt;/ref&gt; (according to one interpretation, the link with Symbolism was even preserved by Tzara himself, despite his international profile in Dada and Surrealism).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Beitchman, "Symbolism in the Streets", in ''I Am a Process with No Subject'', [[University Press of Florida|University of Florida Press]], Gainesville, 1988, p.27-52. {{ISBN|0-8130-0888-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving between Fondane's version of bucolic literature and a similar commitment to Surrealism, the younger Jewish poet [[Ilarie Voronca]] maintained links with Symbolist [[poetics]] throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38, 325. See also: {{ro icon}} [[Bogdan Crețu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BCRETUiul7.html "Ilarie Voronca: Morala și religia poemului"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2007; [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Parisul-lui-Ilarie-Voronca*articleID_18951-articles_details.html "Parisul lui Ilarie Voronca"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 403-404, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contimporanul'' itself remained open to the contribution of other Symbolists throughout its existence, and, as a consequence, alienated the new avant-garde trend of the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50-51, 148-153, 408&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the refusal of severing links with the Symbolist past and their overall eclecticism, made both Vinea and Voronca the targets of ridicule from the more radical Surrealist faction around ''[[unu]]'' review.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38, 241-244&lt;/ref&gt; However, the latter environment also kept a traceable link to Symbolist aesthetics, particularly the literary wing of Secession art, through the fiction and translations of [[H. Bonciu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900-901; Grigorescu, p.416-417, 418. See also {{ro icon}} Gabriela Glăvan, [http://www.litere.uvt.ro/vechi/documente_pdf/stiintefilologice/2006_integral.pdf "H.

Despite having been lampooned by ''[[Facla]]'', ''Insula'' and the other Symbolist circles,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.28, 63-65&lt;/ref&gt; literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]] came to identify with the essence of Romanian modernism by the 1920s. Initially inspired by the ''Junimea'' guidelines and the critical tradition of his native Moldavia, he slowly adapted his style to [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionist literature]], but for long remained skeptic of more ambitious modernist experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.799-808; Cernat, p.61, 63-65, 134-135, 297, 299, 304, 308, 310, 314-315, 319-320, 326, 348, 404, 411-412; Ornea, p.31, 37-38, 47, 67-68, 70, 124-125, 133, 139-147, 267-268, 377; Vianu, Vol. II, p.11, 314-316; Vol. III, p.98, 270-271, 315, 394, 403-404&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Lovinescu's ideology came to resemble Symbolism: there various point of contact between his main tribune, ''[[Sburătorul]]'', and the more nostalgic wing of post-Symbolism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovinescu was for a while credited as a "Symbolist critic".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Victor Buciu, [http://www.romlit.ro/cronicarul_antifoiletonistic "Cronicarul antifoiletonistic"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 39/2008; Gabriela Omăt, [http://www.romlit.ro/e._lovinescu_-_proze_uitate "E. Lovinescu - proze uitate"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 33/2002&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless still a censor of those Symbolists who had sided with the Central Powers during the wartime regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.808; Cernat, p.39, 45. See also Boia, p.326, 364-365&lt;/ref&gt; This hostile attitude further irritated his various adversaries, who found it ironic that the former enemy of Symbolism had come to be perceived by the general public as the leading authority on modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.64, 134, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitating between ''Sburătorul'' and ''Contimporanul'' were various new poets with eclectic tastes, who cultivated a poetry based on the aesthetics of mystery and formal purism. These "[[Hermeticism (poetry)|hermeticist]]" or "[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]]" authors, having as their leading representatives [[Ion Barbu]] and the younger [[Dan Botta]], moved its international reference point back to the roots of Symbolism, with [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.48, 57-96, 104, 112, 172-184, 202, 279, 360; Călinescu, p.645, 750, 792, 840, 866, 867, 892-896, 901-907; Carlson, p.77, 78; Cernat, p.78, 81, 147-148, 152-153, 170, 238-239, 351-352, 402; Vianu, Vol. III, p.392-469&lt;/ref&gt; In varying degrees, this tendency was also illustrated by [[Radu Boureanu]], [[Barbu Brezianu]], [[Eugen Jebeleanu]], [[Simion Stolnicu]], [[Cicerone Theodorescu]] and [[Andrei Tudor]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.901-907; Cernat, p.153. According to Călinescu, the "Hermeticist" trend also marked periods in the careers of [[Emil Botta]], [[Virgil Gheorghiu (avant-garde poet)|Virgil Gheorghiu]], [[Emil Gulian]], [[Mircea Pavelescu]], [[Ion Pogan]], [[Alexandru Robot]], [[Horia Stamatu]], [[Vladimir Streinu]] and various members of the ''[[Iconar]]'' circle.&lt;/ref&gt; In Transylvania, another school of poets, presided over by [[Aron Cotruș]], cultivated a merger of modernist social protest and rural settings, but with distinct echoes from [[Russian Symbolism]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.841-842, 942-943; Grigorescu, p.411-413&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Radu Stanca]] experimented with Symbolism and Aestheticism before joining the [[Sibiu Literary Circle]].&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/iunie2009.pdf "I. Negoițescu — între exaltare și rațiune"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 6/2009, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===From censorship to Neosymbolism===
The 1920s and '30s witnessed a transition of various formerly Symbolist authors toward folkloric traditionalism. This was in particular the case of Maniu (who did not entirely abandon his modernist language, but fused it into a new style) and [[Ion Pillat]], both of whom gravitated around the neo-traditionalist publication ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.645-646, 805, 819, 824-826, 845, 866-868, 902, 932, 937, 938, 944; Cernat, p.19, 36-38, 51, 54, 72, 98, 109, 135-137, 143-145, 151-152, 184, 203-204, 208-210, 234-238, 308, 311-312, 398, 402, 408. See also: Balotă, p.97-124; Vianu, Vol. III, p.362-373&lt;/ref&gt; The group also comprised poet and future far-right politician [[Nichifor Crainic]], who blended Symbolism and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilkean]] verse into radical traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Livezeanu]], "After the Great Union: Generational Tensions, Intellectuals, Modernism, and Ethnicity in Interwar Romania", in ''[http://www.nec.ro/fundatia/nec/publications/nation.pdf Nation and National Ideology.

Davidescu]]'s rejection of his own Symbolist roots, making him an advocate of didactic poetry and the author of nostalgic prose,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.698-699&lt;/ref&gt; came together with political radicalization. Like [[Nae Ionescu]] and Crainic, Davidescu became a far-right affiliate, and eventually a supporter of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.137, 153&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution also touched his image of the past: Davidescu initially demanded the revival of Symbolism as a Neoclassical tendency (an ideal stated in his polemic with Fondane during the 1920s), and, in the process of editing a 1943 anthology of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' poetry, substituted the term "Symbolist" for "Parnassian".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.12, 153, 171, 406&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolist aesthetics made an uncharacteristic comeback in official art under the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who commissioned works from [[Ivan Meštrović]], the [[Croatia|Croat]] master of Secession sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.revista22.ro/carol-calare-pe-mihai-nebunul-4539.html "Carol călare pe Mihai (Nebunul)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 948, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] banned the Jewish Symbolists, alongside many other Jewish writers; this approach was notably resisted by George Călinescu, whose 1941 study of Romanian literature featured ample coverage of Jewish contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-177.  {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the first decades of [[Communist Romania|communist rule]], when the politically motivated art of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]] monopolized the cultural scene, the legacy of Symbolism was stifled and its surviving representatives were among the prime targets of [[Censorship in Communist Romania|official censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.78-80; Cernat, p.129-130, 354-359.

The age of [[liberalization]], coinciding with the final Gheorghiu-Dej years and the rise of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], reversed the censorship trend: by the late 1960s, Symbolism had been largely recognized as part of Romania's literary and artistic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt; With the relaxation of censorship came a general revival of modernism, which included, in some cases, the adoption of [[Neosymbolism]].

A generation later, the ''[[Optzeciști]]'' writers, seeking escape from communist realities, took refuge in the bookish and imaginative universe. This opened several links with the Symbolist generations, and the more evident Neosymbolist aesthetics were deduced by critical opinion in lyrical works by the ''Optzeciști'' [[Mircea Cărtărescu]] and [[Traian T. Coșovei]].&lt;ref name="pcivanescu"/&gt; After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], several new arrivals to literature embraced Neosymbolist aesthetics.

It consists of four movements and is considered the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself. It has many melodic resemblances to both ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', two theatre works that diverted Borodin's attention on and off during the six years of composition.

==Composition==
Although he had a keen interest in music, Borodin's scientific research and teaching duties as an adjunct professor of Chemistry in the Medico-Surgical Academy at [[St. Petersburg]] since 1874 interrupted his composition of the Second [[Symphony]]. As a result, this symphony took several years to complete.

{{quote|On visiting him I seldom found him working in the laboratory which adjoined his apartment. When he sat over his retorts filled with some colorless gas and distilled it by means of a tube from one vessel into another, I used to tell him that he was ‘transfusing emptiness into vacancy’. Having finished his work, he would go without me to his apartment, where he began musical operations or conversations, in the midst of which he used to jump up, run back to the laboratory to see whether something had not burned out or boiled over; meanwhile he filled the corridor with incredible sequences from successions of ninths or sevenths.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Lee. Greenwalt. "A Study of the Symphony in Russia from Glinka to the Early Twentieth Century." (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilm, 1972), 120.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Rimsky-Korsakov]]}}

Immediately after the successful premiere of his first symphony in E-flat conducted by [[Mily Balakirev]] at the Imperial Russian Music concert in 1869, Borodin began writing the Second Symphony in B minor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Abraham]], foreword to Alexander Borodin, "Symphony No. 2 in B minor," 1869–76 (London: Ernst Eulenberg), ii.&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, he left off work on the piece in order to work on ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (Knyaz Igor), an opera based on a 12th-century epic "the Story of Igor's Army," suggested by his friend and first biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]]. Borodin suddenly decided to abandon ''Prince Igor'' in March 1870, criticizing his own inability to write a libretto that would satisfy both musical and scenic requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W Oldani, "Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir’yevich," in [[Grove Music Online]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com] (accessed 10 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He told his wife, "There is scarcely any drama or scenic movement… Anyhow, opera seems to me an unnatural thing… besides I am by nature a lyricist and symphonist; I am attracted by the symphonic forms."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after setting ''Prince Igor'' aside, Borodin returned to the B minor Symphony, assuring Stasov that the "materials" created for the opera would be used in the newly revived symphony. According to Stasov in an article contributed to the "Vestnik Evropi" in 1883, Borodin told him more than once that in the first movement he wished to depict a gathering of Russian warrior-heroes, in the slow movement the figure of a bayan—a type of Russian [[accordion]], and in the finale a scene of heroes feasting to the sound of guslis—an ancient plucked instrument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He composed most of the first movement in April 1870, and he wrote it out onto a piano score a year later, in spring 1871. In that same year he sketched the Scherzo and Andante. That summer he orchestrated the first movement, and in October he drafted the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borodin's work on the symphony was again interrupted when the Director of the Imperial Theatres, Stephan Gedenov, asked him to collaborate on an extravagant opera-ballet ''[[Mlada]]'' with other members of [[Vladimir Stasov]]'s "mighty little heap," namely [[Cesar Cui]], [[Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Maes, A History of Russian Music: From Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar, translated by [[Arnold J. Pomerans]] and Erica Pomerans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In his usual fashion of composing, Borodin borrowed heavily from earlier works, in this case ''Prince Igor''. The show was ultimately cancelled because of production costs, and Borodin once again turned to the B minor Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new interest took his attention away from the composition once again in the fall of 1872 as the [[Tsar Alexander II]]'s government passed legislation allowing women to take advanced medical courses. As an advocate of the new campaign, Borodin became the founder of a School of Medicine for women, where he taught several courses. Despite these distractions, Borodin finished the piano score in May 1873.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Oldani, "Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir’yevich."&lt;/ref&gt;

The following academic year (1873–74), more and more aggravated that he was not receiving support or recognition for his scientific work, he published his last paper on aldehydes and turned to teaching; it was at this time that he became director of the Medical-Surgical Academy's laboratory facilities. Meanwhile, he also took up ''Prince Igor'' again and worked on orchestrating the final three movements of the symphony, although this work was not ultimately completed until 1875.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In the autumn of 1876, the [[Russian Musical Society]] showed an interest in performing the symphony; however, Borodin was disconcerted to find that he had lost the full score.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Although the middle movements were eventually found, he had to reorchestrate the outer two movements while sick in bed. The work was premiered 10 March 1877&lt;ref&gt;26 February/10 March. Dates in scholarly texts for this and other Russian works are frequently shown with both the earlier [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] dates, and later [[Gregorian calendar]] dates; Russia used the Eastern Orthodox calendar until the fall of tsarist Russia with the beginning of the [[communist]] regime when [[Lenin]] changed to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;/ref&gt; under the baton of [[Eduard Nápravník]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This symphony fits in the debate over the merit of [[folklore]] elements and traditional western art music values, which was a central conflict of [[Romantic nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was popular, but according to Rimsky-Korsakov, only enjoyed "moderate success" because Borodin had written the brass part too thickly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Borodin's relationship with [[Liszt]] also had impacted his symphonic writing. Later in 1877, Borodin traveled to Germany in order to enroll some of his chemistry pupils in Jena University. While in Germany, Borodin visited Liszt in [[Weimar]] where the two played through both of Borodin's symphonies in four-hand piano arrangements. Liszt had been an admirer of Borodin's music and he arranged performances of Borodin's symphonies, making them the first Russian symphonies to be received abroad. Regarding Borodin's attempt to revise his score, Liszt said,

{{quote|Heaven forbid! Do not touch it; alter nothing. Your modulations are neither extravagant nor faulty. Your artistic instinct is such that you need not fear to be original. Do not listen to those who would deter you from following your own way. You are on the right road. Similar advice was given to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who wisely ignored it. Despite the adage that ‘there is nothing new under the sun,’ your Second Symphony is entirely new. Nobody had done anything like it. And it is perfectly logical in structure."…. From another source you are always lucid, intelligent and perfectly original […] work in your own way and pay no attention to anyone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

==Score and edition==
In 1879 Borodin revised the orchestration of the symphony and thinned out the heavy brass parts. The premiere of this final version took place 4 March 1879 under the baton of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] at a Free School Concert.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, v.&lt;/ref&gt; Borodin became occupied with the symphony one last time in 1886, while preparing the manuscript full score for the printer. He made a few refinement changes suggested by Rimsky-Korsakov, who also provided the [[metronome]] markings based on the successful second performance.

==Description==
[[File:Theme from the second symphony (Borodin's tomb).JPG|220 px|thumb|Theme of the first movement on Borodin's grave monument.]]

The B minor [[Symphony]] is arguably the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself, and is considered to be one of his greatest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It has many melodic resemblances to both ''Prince Igor'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', which were two theatrical works that diverted Borodin's attention away from the B minor symphony between 1869–75.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; According to the account of Borodin's friend [[Nikolay Kashkin]], the symphony's striking and abrupt opening theme originated from the abandoned chorus of [[Polovtsian]]s,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biographer Serge Dianin notes that there is a common thread present in all three pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Dianin, Borodin, translated by Robert Lord (London: [[Oxford University Press]], 1963), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dianin, "it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes [[Borodin]] uses in these works." &lt;ref&gt;According to Dianin, "it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes [[Borodin]] uses in these works."&lt;/ref&gt; The relation to the heroic world of ''Prince Igor'' led Stasov to nickname the work the "''Bogatirskaya simfoniya''" ("Heroic symphony").&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Allegro moderato===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=73]]

Excluding the E natural, the opening theme is made up of an [[octatonic]] subcollection which consists of the major and minor 3rd above the tonic. The alternation between major and minor thirds is found throughout the symphony, and is based on this opening theme.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The lyrical second theme in D major not only sets a contrast to the first theme, but also to present the cyclic elements evident in the whole work. This is very recognizable in the trio of the [[scherzo]] movement, and distantly echoed in the finale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Maes states that the second theme is a protyazhnaya stylization, which he defines as "a splendid form of melismatically decorated song set to poetry of great expressive power and lyrical intensity." &lt;ref&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second theme in the recapitulation is also in E-flat (a diminished fourth away from the opening theme), making it an [[enharmonic]] major third above B natural. This makes the interchange between the major and minor third not only melodic, but structural as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Musicologist A. Peter Brown notes that the first movement is a [[sonata form]], shaped by a somewhat unusual key scheme in the recapitulation, and provides the following analysis of the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;A. Peter Brown and Brian Hart, The European Symphony from ca. 1800 to ca. 1930, vol. 3, part B: Great Britain, Russia, and France. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008), 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Borodin treats the exposition in a typical manner, S in the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] does not return to the tonic key or even to a closely related key. Instead, he uses two keys (E-flat and C) which are not only distant from B minor, but also unrelated to the tonic key of S in the exposition. Brown concludes with the following thoughts about the first movement:

{{quote|For a supposedly dilettante [[composer]] who had little training in the academic studies of musical composition, this first movement is a significant accomplishment. Though it has virtually no [[polyphony]], Borodin has sustained this piece with attractive melodies motivically interrelated, a large-scale sense of rhythm, effective orchestration in the revised version, and idiosyncratic use of harmony and [[modulation]], particularly in the recapitulation. This masterly first movement is a considerable advance over that of his First Symphony, whose high originality made it at times less effective.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2008), 316&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In spite of the first movement's sonata-like form, according to Brown, musicologist Francis Maes states that because of a compulsive repetition of the motto – in sequences, diminutions, and augmentations – the orchestration – with intensive use of the low brass – and the peculiarity of tempo changes, "all this turns the first movement into a montage of contrasts rather than into a developing sonata form."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Despite this apparent conflict, music critic David Fanning argues that Borodin's use of melodic material, and the heroic themes that result, are "virtually unprecedented in the history of the symphony." &lt;ref&gt;Fanning, David. "Building a Library; Borodin's Symphony No. 2." [[BBC Music Magazine]]. Vol. 5, issue 8. (London: [[BBC]] Magazines, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===II. Scherzo. Molto vivo===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=74]]

The second movement is unconventional in many ways, as it moves to the key of F major – a very remote key; which may have been Balakirev's idea originally.&lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; It breaks from the usual triple meter, and it groups together unusual lengths of phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Borodin opts for {{music|time|1|1}} time with a tempo marking of 108 – four quarter notes to a bar with a whole note receiving the beat – and alternates between four and five bar phrases, with an occasional one or two bar phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great deal of rhythmic contrast between the two main ideas; the first is firmly on the beat, while the second is syncopated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

After a four bar introduction, a majority of the [[Scherzo]] proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a "kaleidoscope of color."&lt;ref&gt;After a four bar introduction, a majority of the Scherzo proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a "kaleidoscope of color."&lt;/ref&gt; Dianin notes that the second subject in this passage ends in an unusual fashion, marked by descending leaps of a fourth;&lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; while Maes points out the recollection of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], particularly the [[oriental]]-sounding Trio (Allegretto).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Following the transition to the Allegretto section in {{music|time|6|4}}, we have the second main theme. Brown had the following thoughts of this portion of the second movement:

{{quote|Perhaps, this Allegretto is a Russian Barcarolle with its lilting rhythms in compound-duple meter, mild [[hemiola]]s, and a melody marked [[cantabile]] e dolce. Borodin's orchestration of the background is almost [[Klangfarben]] with harp, triangle, and horns providing a pointilistic accompaniment. The form builds through repetitions of its four-measure theme with changes to its background in good kuchkist fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the Allegretto is a return of the Scherzo proper, which [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] found to be the weak link in the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

===III. Andante===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=75]]
According to Borodin's friend and chief biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]], the third movement of the symphony was intended to depict the Slavic minstrel [[Boyan (bard)|Boyan]] accompanying himself on a [[gusli]] (a type of [[zither]]), represented by the [[harp]]. While this movement is similar to the third movement of his first symphony, the structure differs being [[rondo]]-like:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Andante begins with what Oldani calls "one of Borodin's most serene melodies," &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; played by solo clarinet and accompanied by the harp, and what follows is a horn solo with the ornamental grace notes that are quite typical of Borodin's lyrical melodies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This melody is heard from various instruments throughout the piece, while some of the material incorporates the interaction between minor and major thirds present in the Allegro (I).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The movement ends in a similar fashion to how it began, with clarinet solo followed by horn solo, accompanied by harp. Maes eloquently summarizes the mystique of the third movement by pointing out how powerfully it refers to the "mythical, imaginary world of both ''Ruslan'' and ''Prince Igor''." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===IV. Finale. Allegro===

According to Oldani the finale is in sonata form, but more free than the first movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, Brown points out that there are at least three viable ways to interpret the formal structure of this movement:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt; 1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic sonata form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.&lt;ref&gt;1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic [[sonata]] form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.&lt;/ref&gt; This section begins with a pentatonic theme in the violin and viola, with the development consisting of a [[whole-tone]] passage which is also used in both Mlada and the prologue of ''Prince Igor''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stasov states that this movement is a scene of great celebration, which Borodin conveys by writing Slavic dances in mixed triple and duple meter, and [[syncopated]] [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeats]]. These elements, combined with the addition of cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and bass drum, give the music not only a Slavic dance feel, but also makes it "[[Music of Turkey|Turkish]]" sounding to western ears.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Each dance has its own bold rhythmic motion which is a result of the syncopation, as well as the resilient anacrustic formations;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Dianin describes the tone of the movement as being "bright and jubilant." &lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
According to Dianin, Stasov believed that Borodin had the knights and [[heroic]] figures of ancient Russia in mind with this piece. "The first movement depicts an assembly of Russian knights […] the Scherzo could be intended to suggest a headlong chase, but it could equally well be a festive scene […] the third movement was to have depicted Bayan, the legendary minstrel who appears in the ''Lay of Igor's Campaign'' […] and the finale is meant to depict ‘the knights’ feast, the sound of the gusli, and a jubilant throng of people." &lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianin concludes by stating that the overall character of Borodin's Symphony No. 2 is patriotic, and that he is showing his sincere admiration for the strength and courage of the men of old, who "saved Russia from her enemies."&lt;ref name="Dianin, Borodin, 209"&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Borodin not only admired these great heroes of Russian history, but was able to capture their essence in his music.&lt;ref name="Dianin, Borodin, 209"/&gt; In summing up the work, Brown had the following comment:

{{quote|The Second Symphony proved to be Borodin's great work. Whatever Borodin's technical limitations as a composer, they fail to be revealed in this symphony. The power, the playfulness, the lyricism, and the liveliness incorporated into each of the movements make for a compelling gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7099">"'''Television and the Public Interest'''" was a speech given by [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) chairman [[Newton N. Minow]] to the convention of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] on May 9, 1961. The speech was Minow's first major speech after he was appointed chairman of the FCC by President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In the speech, Minow referred to American commercial television programming as a "'''vast wasteland'''" and advocated for programming in the [[public interest]]. In hindsight, the speech marked the end of a [[Golden Age of Television]] that had run through the 1950s, contrasting the highbrow programs of that decade with what had appeared on American television in [[1960–61 United States network television schedule|1960 and 1961]].

{{quote|When television is good, nothing &amp;mdash; not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers &amp;mdash; nothing is better.

But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite each of you to sit down in front of your own television set when your station goes on the air and stay there, for a day, without a book, without a magazine, without a newspaper, without a profit and loss sheet or a rating book to distract you. Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that what you will observe is a vast wasteland.

You will see a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly commercials &amp;mdash; many screaming, cajoling, and offending. And most of all, boredom. True, you'll see a few things you will enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, I only ask you to try it.&lt;ref&gt;Newton N. Minow, "[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/newtonminow.htm Television and the Public Interest]", address to the National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, D.C., May 9, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his speech Minow also shared advice to his audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Television and all who participate in it are jointly accountable to the American public for respect for the special needs of children, for community responsibility, for the advancement of education and culture, for the acceptability of the program materials chosen, for decency and decorum in production, and for propriety in advertising. This responsibility cannot be discharged by any given group of programs, but can be discharged only through the highest standards of respect for the American home, applied to every moment of every program presented by television. Program materials should enlarge the horizons of the viewer, provide him with wholesome entertainment, afford helpful stimulation, and remind him of the responsibilities which the citizen has toward his society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/documents/vast_wasteland.htm|title=Newton Minow: The 'vast wasteland' of television speech|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was a landmark speech for the medium of [[television]], at a time when there were only three networks in the United States and when the realm of television was much less vast than it would later become.  Nonetheless, it is counted as one of a hundred best American speeches of the 20th century by several authorities and selected as one of twenty-five 'Speeches that Changed the World' by Vital Speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmurry.com/pdf/01_04_07_BestofVitalSpeeches.pdf The Best of Vital Speeches of the Day: 25 Speeches That Changed Our World.] ''McMurry.'' 4 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2018}} Related writings include his book (co-written with Craig LaMay) ''Abandoned in the Wasteland: Children, Television, &amp; the First Amendment''.

The phrase "vast wasteland" was suggested to Minow by his friend, reporter and freelance writer [[John Bartlow Martin]]. Martin had recently watched twenty consecutive hours of television as research for a magazine piece, and concluded it was "a vast wasteland of junk." During the editing process, Minow cut the words "of junk." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fallows|first=James|title=Where the Phrase 'Vast Wasteland' Came From|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/where-the-phrase-vast-wasteland-came-from/238743/|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=The Atlantic Monthly|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minow often remarks that the two words best remembered from the speech are "vast wasteland," but the two words he wishes would be remembered are "public interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ted|title="A Vast Wasteland," 50 Years Later|url=http://www.wilshireandwashington.com/2011/05/a-vast-wasteland-50-years-later.html|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=Variety magazine|date=9 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517224745/http://www.wilshireandwashington.com/2011/05/a-vast-wasteland-50-years-later.html|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lambasting of the state of United States television programming prompted Sherwood Schwartz to name the boat on his television show ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' after Newton Minow; the wreck was named the ''Minnow''.&lt;ref name=SantaClaraLawReview&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwartz, Sherwood|title=Inside Gilligan's Island |year=1994|pages=xv}} cited in {{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol39/iss1/4/|title=Legal Tales from Gilligan's Island|author=Jarvis, Robert M. |journal=Santa Clara Law Review|publisher=Santa Clara University Law School |year=1998|volume=39|pages=185|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Strand Magazine''''' was a monthly [[magazine]] founded by [[George Newnes]], composed of short fiction and general interest articles. It was published in the United Kingdom from January 1891&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; to March 1950, running to 711 issues,&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike. ''The Age of the Storytellers'', The British Library and Oak Knoll Press, p. 196. 2006. {{ISBN|0-7123-0698-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the first issue was on sale well before Christmas 1890.
Its immediate popularity is evidenced by an initial sale of nearly 300,000. Sales increased in the early months, before settling down to a circulation of almost 500,000 copies a month which lasted well into the 1930s. It was edited by [[Herbert Greenhough Smith]] from 1891 to 1930.
The magazine's original offices were in Burleigh Street off [[Strand, London|The Strand]], London. It was revived in 1998 as a quarterly magazine.

It was normally bound as six-monthly volumes, from January to June and July to December, but from the mid-1930s this varied, and the final volumes in the late 1940s ran from October to March and April to September, the final volume CXVIII (118) running from October 1949 to March 1950. 

==Fiction==
The [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] were first published in ''The Strand'' with illustrations by [[Sidney Paget]]. With the serialisation of Doyle's ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', sales reached their peak. Readers lined up outside the magazine's offices, waiting to get the next instalment. [[E. W. Hornung]]'s stories about [[A. J. Raffles]], the "gentleman thief", first appeared in ''The Strand'' in the 1890s. Other contributors included [[Grant Allen]], [[Margery Allingham]], [[J. E. Preston Muddock]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Mary Angela Dickens]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Walter Goodman]], [[E. Nesbit]], [[W. W. Jacobs]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Arthur Morrison]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Georges Simenon]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[Max Beerbohm]], [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Dornford Yates]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. Once a sketch drawn by [[Queen Victoria]] of one of her children appeared with her permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/StrandMagazine3/Strand3#page/n1/mode/2up |title=''The Strand Magazine'', Volume 1, Issue 3 (March 1891), pp. 226ff |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puzzles==
In addition to the many fiction pieces and illustrations, ''The Strand'' was also known for some time as the source of ground-breaking brain teasers, under a column called "Perplexities", first written by [[Henry Dudeney]]. Dudeney introduced many new concepts to the puzzle world, including the first known [[cross-figure|crossnumber]] puzzle, in 1926. In that same year, Dudeney produced an article, "The Psychology of Puzzle Crazes", reflecting and analysing the demand for such works. He edited Perplexities from 1910 until he died in 1930. G.H. Savage became the column's editor, soon to be joined by [[W. T. Williams|William Thomas Williams]] (as W.T. Williams), who in 1935 authored the best-known [[cross-figure]] puzzle of today. The puzzle goes by many names, the original being "The Little Pigley Farm". It has also been known as "Dog's Mead", "Little Pigley", "Little Piggly Farm", "Little Pigsby", "Pilgrims’ Plot", and "Dog Days".

==Cover==
The magazine's iconic cover, an illustration looking eastwards down London's [[Strand, London|Strand]] towards [[St Mary-le-Strand]], with the title suspended on telegraph wires, was the work of Victorian artist and designer [[George Charles Haité]]. The initial cover featured a corner plaque showing the name of Burleigh Street, home to the magazine's original offices. The lettering on the plaque in Haité's design was later changed when Newnes moved to the adjacent address of Southampton Street. A variation of the same design was featured on the cover of a sister title, ''The Strand Musical Magazine''.

==Final days==
The magazine format changed to the smaller [[digest size]] in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Strand Magazine'' ceased publication in March 1950, forced out of the market by declining circulation and rising costs. Its last editor was [[Macdonald Hastings]], distinguished [[war correspondent]] and later TV reporter and contributor to the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' boys' comic.

==United States edition==

The magazine also published a United States edition from February 1891 through February 1916. In its early years, the contents of the U.S. edition were identical with those of the U.K. edition, though usually with a one-month time lag. As the years went on there were some differences in the contents of the two editions, reflecting fiction for which ''The Strand'' did not hold the U.S. rights (such as ''The Return of Sherlock Holmes'', which was commissioned by ''Collier's'') and non-fiction that would not interest most U.S. readers (such as articles about personalities in the House of Commons). The circulation of the U.S. edition was minimal in the early 1890s but was reported at 150,000 by 1898. The U.S. edition was discontinued in 1916 due to logistical difficulties arising from World War I.&lt;ref&gt;See Philip G.

'''''The Wounded Deer'''''  (''El venado herido'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is an [[oil painting]] by [[Mexican art]]ist  [[Frida Kahlo]] created in 1946. It is also known as '''''The Little Deer'''''. Through ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo shares her enduring physical and emotional suffering with her audience, as she did throughout her creative oeuvre. This painting in particular was created towards the end of Kahlo's life, when her health was in decline. Kahlo combines [[pre-Columbian]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Christian]] symbols to express her wide spectrum of influences and beliefs.

==Background==
Frida Kahlo was plagued with poor health her entire life. In 1925, she was in a bus accident that resulted in serious injuries to her entire body. Her spine, ribs, pelvis, right leg, and abdomen were particularly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka.''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; She would deal with the wounds from this accident for the rest of her life. Kahlo painted this [[self-portrait]] before an operation on her spine, which would leave her bedridden for almost a year. During her recovery, she wore a steel corset, which can be seen in her late self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1993. Page 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Her right leg would eventually be amputated up to her knee, as a result of [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1993. Page 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of cultural influences reflect Kahlo's own background. She had a German father and a Mexican mother, thus she was aware of traditional European and Mexican ideas during her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka. ''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that Kahlo was interested in Eastern Religion during the later years of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''Frida Kahlo''. London: Tate Publishing, 2005. Pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Kahlo married fellow [[Mexican art]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] for the second time. Their second marriage saw many of the same problems as their first, filled with jealousy, affairs, and arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka. ''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time she created ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo made a drawing of a young deer in her diary, which is thought to be inspired by her pet deer, Granizo.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''The Diary of Frida Kahlo: an Intimate Self-Portrait''. New York: N.H. Abrams, 1995. Page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wounded Deer'' was given by Frida Kahlo to close friends Arcady and Lina Boytler as a wedding gift.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial. Page 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo paints herself as an animal and human hybrid. She has the body of a deer along with antlers extending from her own head. The deer is standing up, its legs extended in action. Its front right leg is elevated off the ground, as though it is injured or in motion. In the deer's body are nine arrows, creating wounds from which blood flows. The deer is in a forest; nine trees are on the right of the deer, and a broken branch lies in the foreground. Only the tree trunks can be seen in the [[picture plane]]; none of the foliage above is visible. One of the branches on the tree in the right of the foreground is severed. It is probable that the detached limb is the branch located on the ground before the deer. The broken branch is prominent, as it is given more detail by the artist than all of the forest floor. Kahlo's face stares stoically at the viewer, showing little sign of pain. Her neck and head are upright and alert. A set of deer ears emerge from behind Kahlo's own. In the background a body of water is present, which can be seen through the trees. Though the sky is bright, a bolt of lightning strikes down from a white cloud. The word "carma" ([[karma]]) is written in the bottom left corner of the painting, after the artist's signature and the year of creation. ''The Wounded Deer'' is mostly rendered with green, brown, and gray tones, as well as small measures of blue and red. The painting’s physical dimensions are very modest, measuring at only 22.4 x 30 centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Souter, Gerry. ''Frida Kahlo: Beneath the Mirror''. Parkstone International, 2010. Page 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation and analysis==
In this painting, Kahlo shares her lifelong splanchnic pain with her audience.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann. "Three Painters with a Natural Bond; a Passion for Place and Culture Unites O'Keeffe, Kahlo and Carr". ''The Washington Post'', February 10, 2002.&lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/409252883&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New Yorhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_contentk: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The pain she represents is not only physical, but emotional torment caused by her relationship with husband, [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New York: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the grand murals of her [[Mexican muralism|Mexican]] contemporaries, such as Diego Rivera, [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Clemente Orozco]], the paintings of Frida Kahlo were small. Some critics interpret the scale of her works as a sign of isolation, which also downplays her painful circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Booker, Bobbi. "Private Kahlo Works Unveiled". ''Philadelphia Tribune'', February 17, 2008. &lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/337870948&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Mexican tradition to place a broken branch on a grave. This is taken as an acknowledgement of the artist's deteriorating health.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judy Chicago]] and [[Frances Borzello]]. ''Frida Kahlo: Face to Face''. Munich; New York: [[Prestel Publishing|Prestel]], 2012. Page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wounds on the body of the deer, Kahlo does not paint a face of anguish, but of strength.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New York: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars point out that the antlers on Kahlo's head are those of a stag, a male deer.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabelle Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dosamantes-Beaudry, Irma. "Frida Kahlo: Self-Other Representation and Self-Healing Through Art". ''The Arts in Psychotherapy'' 28, no. 1, February 2001. Pages 5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo is representing herself as part male and part female, as well as elements of human and animal features. This hybrid form is often explained by the artist's influence of [[pre-Columbian]] ideas and traditions, which hold the belief that the right foot is represented by a deer.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, days were represented by a symbol and a number. Important dates such as birthdays were used in predictions. Kahlo adopted the deer as a symbol for herself because of its connection to the right foot, and in the [[Aztec]] calendar, she was born on day nine. These two symbols together were not good, as nine was a symbol for earthly elements as well as the underworld, which was made up of nine phases.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The number nine can be seen twice in ''The Wounded Deer'': there are nine trees in the left side, before the clearing that reveals the ocean and lightning bolt, as well as nine arrows protruding from the body of the deer. An additional nine can be seen in the points of her antlers, if counted together.

In the painting, the deer's front right leg is raised off the ground, perhaps in a reflection of Kahlo's own impairment.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she painted ''The Wounded Deer'', Kahlo had difficulty walking, which she would attempt to correct through a spinal surgery later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''The Diary of Frida Kahlo: an Intimate Self-Portrait''. New York: N.H. Abrams, 1995. Page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some art historians believe that Frida Kahlo's decision to portray herself with male and female features is a reflection of her own sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo." The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This perception recognizes her [[bisexuality]]. Other interpretations of the figure relate the male and female elements, referred to as [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]], to pre-Columbian [[Aztec]] beliefs that hold relationships between animals and parts of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the word "[[karma|carma]]", painted in the lower left corner of the painting, is controversial. It was Kahlo's own belief that her life was planned out by destiny or fate, and therefore she could not prevent any of the difficulties she faced.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, her misfortune must have been caused by deeds from her previous lives.

An influence of [[Christianity]] is also integrated through reference to the story of [[Saint Sebastian]], a martyr who was tied to a tree and shot by arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann. "Three Painters with a Natural Bond: A Passion for Place and Culture Unites O'Keeffe, Kahlo and Carr". ''The Washington Post'', February 10, 2002.&lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/409252883&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Sebastian | Biography - Christian Martyr". Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed April 15, 2015. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/531221/Saint-Sebastian&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols combine to reflect Kahlo's multi-cultural reality - a reality which also represents a spectrum of gender possibilities. Frida Kahlo renders herself with these juxtaposing features to explore the concept of the self. Through these changes, identity is seen as dynamic and complex, not a fixed state.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''Frida Kahlo''. London: Tate Publishing. 2005. Pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Yellow Crucifixion''''' is a painting by [[Marc Chagall]]. It was painted in 1943 and is on display at [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in [[Paris, France]].

== Description of Artwork ==

The piece reworked many themes that first occurred in Chagall's more famous artwork ''[[White Crucifixion]]'' whereby the suffering of Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]] was communicated through the image of [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] as a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is not the central image of this picture, and instead shares the canvas with a large green Torah scroll and [[angel]]. This positioning emphasises the Jewish character of Jesus in this work, supported by Jesus wearing a Jewish prayer shawl ([[tallit]]) and [[tefillin]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrounding details are scenes from the programs occurring in Europe. There is a burning [[shtetl]] to the right, surrounded by distressed looking figures. Below this is found a Jew wearing traditional Jewish clothing (and a placard) and a fleeing woman with her child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scene is reminiscent of the story of Jesus’ flight to Egypt as a child.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible. Matt. 2.13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme that has been reworked into the ''Yellow Crucifixion'', which first appeared in the ''White Crucifixion'', is the presence of a ship. The significant difference is that in this painting, the ship is shown sinking into the waters. This is undoubtably an allusion to the [[Struma disaster|''Struma'' disaster]] in 1942. The fact that Jesus is looking down on the ship, watching the passengers, is said to convey the artist's own passage to [[New York City]] from Europe that took place by ship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

Other details include fish leaping out of the sea and a goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Piece ==

Reformed theologian Jürgen Moltmann mentions this painting as being his muse while writing ''The Crucified God'', a book which has been called a Christian [[Holocaust theology|theology after Auschwitz]]:

"In front of me hangs Marc Chagall’s picture ''Crucifixion in Yellow''. It shows the figure of the crucified Christ in an apocalyptic situation: people sinking into the sea, people homeless and in flight, and yellow fire blazing in the background. And with the crucified Christ there appears the angel with the trumpet and the open roll of the book of life [Rev 14.6]. This picture has accompanied me for a long time. It symbolizes the cross on the horizon of the world, and can be thought of as a symbolic expression of the studies which follow." &lt;ref&gt;''The Crucified God'', xxii; See also Moltmann’s autobiography, ''A Broad Place'', p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7874">'''Theatre Pro Rata''' is a small, professional theatre company operating in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], United States.  The company's name is derived from the term [[pro rata]], which comes from the Latin for "in proportion."  Their mission:  To each of us: a foundation in the play, a pursuit of creative excellence, and a continuation of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreprorata.org Theatre Pro Rata website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 2000 under the artistic direction of '''Carin Bratlie''', the company gained local notoriety with ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' as part of the 2002 Minnesota Fringe Festival. Shortly thereafter, Theatre Pro Rata began to produce regular seasons and has taken up residence at the [[Gremlin Theatre]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].

In 2008, ''Metamorphoses'' was named one of the top ten productions of the year by ''[[Lavender Magazine]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=John Townsend | title=2008 Theater Year in Review | work=Lavender Magazine |url=http://www.lavendermagazine.com/archives/issue-354/2008-theater-year-in-review/ |  year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the set design for ''Killer Joe'' named among the best of 2008 by ''[[City Pages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Quinton Skinner | title=The Year's Best Set Designs | work=City Pages |url=http://www.citypages.com/2008-12-24/arts/the-year-s-best-set-designs/ |  year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Theatre Pro Rata produced [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]'s translation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Life of Galileo]]'', coinciding with the [[International Year of Astronomy]] and featuring a gender-blind cast led by Noë Tallen in the title role.

Beginning in 2015 with their production of The Illusion by Tony Kushner, Theatre Pro Rata will perform one show of each season at Park Square Theatre's new Andy Boss Thrust Stage as part of a theatrical collaboration between the two companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9106">The '''Videogame Rating Council''' ('''V.R.C.''') was introduced by [[Sega]] of America in 1993 to rate all [[video games]] that were released for sale in the [[United States]] on the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Game Gear]], [[Sega CD]], and [[Sega Pico|Pico]]. The rating had to be clearly displayed on the front of the box, but their appearance in advertisements for the video game was strictly optional. It was later supplanted by the industry-wide [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]].

== History ==

{{See also2|[[Entertainment Software Rating Board#Background|Background of the Entertainment Software Rating Board]]}} As the [[16-bit era]] of video games began in the late 1980s, their content became more realistic. The increased graphical and audio fidelity of the products made violent scenes appear more explicit, especially those containing blood.{{sfn|Caron|Cohen|2013|p=91}}  As controversy stemmed around the realism of this violence, 1992 games ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Night Trap]]'' entered the limelight. ''Mortal Kombat'' is a "brutal" fighting game and ''Night Trap'' is a [[full-motion video]] [[Sega CD]] game where players protect a [[slumber party]] from [[vampires]]. The games were at the center of [[1993 Congressional hearings on video games|federal hearings held from December 9, 1993 to March 4, 1994]] by United States Senators [[Joseph Lieberman]] and [[Herbert Kohl]].{{sfn|Budziszewski|2012|p=196}}{{refn|group=note|Formally, these were the joint hearings between the Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice of the Committee of the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information of the Committee of Governmental Affairs of the [[103rd United States Congress]].{{sfn|Budziszewski|2012|p=196}} }} . One quote that explains how Lieberman felt about video games during one of these trials is “Instead of enriching a child’s mind... these games teach a child to enjoy inflicting torture.”[https://kotaku.com/25-years-later-disgusting-night-trap-is-incredibly-tam-1797864067]. As a result, the video game industry was given a year to create its own classification system or to otherwise have one imposed on them by the federal government.{{sfn|Caron|Cohen|2013|p=91}}

Prior to the hearings, Sega had created its own Videogame Rating Council (VRC) in June 1993. The council consisted of experts in education, psychology, and sociology as appointed by Sega.{{sfn|Foerstel|1997|p=223}} The VRC was one of several ratings groups to appear (among them, [[The 3DO Company|3DO]]'s [[3DO Rating System]]). The VRC classified games that worked with Sega's consoles into three categories based on age:{{sfn|Caron|Cohen|2013|p=91}} GA ("general audiences"), MA-13 ("mature audiences"), and MA-17 ("for adults").{{sfn|Foerstel|1997|p=223}}  It was criticized by journalists and consumer groups for vagueness and inconsistency,{{sfn|Caron|Cohen|2013|p=91}} and other companies did not want Sega to be in charge of the ratings organization.{{sfn|Foerstel|1997|p=223}} The lead editorial in the January 1994 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also criticized Sega for failing to inform and educate the public on the ratings system, particularly noting that the ratings appeared on the game boxes but usually not in advertisements for the games, and that most parents "either haven't a clue as to what [Sega's ratings] mean, don't know that they exist, or don't know why the game got the rating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=Violence in Video Games... Part 2!|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=54|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=January 1994|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the hearings, the games industry created the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] in April 1994, which made a proposal for a rating system. The proposal was adopted by the United States Congress in July 1994 and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) was founded in September to execute the plan.{{sfn|Budziszewski|2012|p=196}} The VRC ultimately folded that year when replaced by the ESRB.{{sfn|Caron|Cohen|2013|p=91}} VRC ratings had been used on several hundred games made by Sega and others.{{sfn|Foerstel|1997|p=223}}

== Ratings ==

The three different ratings were as follows:
{|
| [[File:VRC General Audiences.svg|100px]] || '''GA''' &amp;mdash; '''General Audiences''': ''Appropriate for all audiences.'' No blood or graphic violence. No profanity, no mature sexual themes and no usage of drugs or alcohol.
|-
| [[File:VRC Mature 13.svg|100px]] || '''MA-13''' &amp;mdash; '''Mature Audiences''': ''Parental Discretion Advised.'' The game was suitable for audiences thirteen years of age or older (or teenagers). Game could have some blood in it and more graphic violence than a "GA" game.
|-
| [[File:VRC Mature 17.svg|100px]] || '''MA-17''' &amp;mdash; '''Mature Audiences''': ''Not [[appropriate for minors]].'' The game was suitable for audiences seventeen years of age or older. Games could have lots of blood, graphic violence, mature sexual themes, profanity, drug or alcohol usage.
|-
| &lt;!--[[Image:VRC NYR.JPG|100px]] (This space reserved for an image) --&gt; ||'''NYR''' or, '''Not Yet Rated''': This rating only appeared in advertising and indicated that the game had not yet been rated by the V.R.C. The modern equivalents would be [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]'s RP (Rating Pending) rating and [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]]'s TBC label.
|}
[[File:Recoloured Ratings.png|173px|frameless|none]]
The rating symbols appear above in their standard black and white format, but were typically recolored when appearing on actual box art.

==Before the Videogame Rating Council==
While rival console manufacturer [[Nintendo]] enforced [[Nintendo#Content guidelines|strict content guidelines]] for games released on its hardware, Sega differentiated itself with a more liberal content policy, allowing for the depiction of blood and graphic violence in software released on its home consoles, provided that the publisher label the game's packaging with a generic "Parental Advisory" warning.

Such an advisory was put on the packaging for the following games: ''[[Techno Cop]]'', ''[[Splatterhouse 2]]'' 

However, nudity and other sexual content remained taboo.  Games made for Sega systems generally toned down sexual content.

The nude fairies found in ''[[Stormlord]]'' were given some scantily clad attire, when the game was ported over to the Sega Genesis.

Similarly, when Sega localized ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'' for western consumers, it edited dialogue in the game to obscure a non-playable character's homosexuality.

==Notable cases==

===''Mortal Kombat''===
The video game company [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] brought ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' to the Genesis and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] in 1993. Both Sega and Nintendo ordered the game's graphic violence and blood to be toned down.

However, Sega allowed the player to restore the controversial content with a secret code, announced the creation of the Videogame Rating Council and gave ''Mortal Kombat'' an MA-13 rating. The result was that the Sega Genesis version of ''Mortal Kombat'' outsold the Super NES version. However, the commercial success of the game, including a marketing campaign by Acclaim to prepare consumers for "Mortal Monday", and the fact that the Videogame Rating Council opened the doorway for games to be sold on a Sega console system with adult content promoted national outrage.

The '''WAMPAS Baby Stars''' was a promotional campaign sponsored by the United States '''Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers''', which honored 13 (15 in 1932) young actresses each year whom they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. The campaign intermittently ran from 1922 to 1934.

==Overview==
The WAMPAS Baby Stars campaign began in 1922. Every year, publicists chose a group of young actresses who were under contract at major studios that they felt were on the threshold of stardom. Awardees were honored at a party called the "WAMPAS Frolic" and were given extensive media coverage. The awards were not given in 1930 and 1933 due to objections from independent film studios.{{sfn|Vogel|2010|p=20}} When the campaign was revived in 1934, freelance actresses, along with studio contract players, were included as the chosen "Baby Stars".{{sfn|Slide|2014|p=231}} 

The campaign ended after 1935, after which the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers disbanded.{{sfn|Slide|2014|p=231}} In 1956, a group of veteran stars, among them 1932 WAMPAS Baby Star [[Ginger Rogers]], chose a group of young actresses supposed to be known as The Wampas Baby Stars. However,  since the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers no longer existed, the idea fizzled. The selection took place nevertheless, and 15 "babies" were chosen: Phyllis Applegate, Roxanne Arlen, [[Jolene Brand]], Donna Cooke, Barbara Huffman (later known as [[Barbara Eden]]), Jewell Lain, Barbara Marx&lt;!-- not likely to be the same woman who married Zeppo Marx as she didn't marry Marx until the 1970s--&gt;, Lita Milan, Norma Nilsson, Ina Poindexter, Violet Rensin, [[Dawn Richard (model)|Dawn Richard]], and Delfin Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chuck Anderson|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/ladies88.htm|title=1956 lineup|publisher=B-westerns.com|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last surviving original WAMPAS Baby Star, [[Mary Carlisle]], died at the age of 104 on August 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ln-mary-carlisle-20180801-story.html|title=Mary Carlisle, a perpetual ingenue in dozens of 1930s films, dies at 104|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 1, 2018|archive-url=http://archive.is/GmhhF|archive-date=August 2, 2018|author=Bernstein, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zamorano Eighty''' is a list of books intended to represent the most significant early volumes published on the [[History of California|history]] of [[California]].  It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club, a [[Los Angeles]]-based group of [[bibliophile]]s.  Collecting [[first edition]]s of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors, though to date only four people have completed the task.&lt;ref name="volkmann"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dan-Volkmann-collector-of-rare-books-dies-3162597.php | title=Dan Volkmann, collector of rare books, dies | publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=May 7, 2009 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Tucker, Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for [[Agustín Vicente Zamorano]], the first [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] in California.&lt;ref name="zhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/history/ | title=History of the Zamorano Club | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 3, 2013 | author=Nunis, Doyce B., Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madness"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z-KL2voBoUC | title=A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | author=Basbanes, Nicholas A. | authorlink=Nicholas A. Basbanes | date=March 15, 1999 | pages=492–6 | isbn=978-0-8050-6176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifford "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-18/local/me-3445_1_zamorano-club | title=An Exclusive Club of Many Chapters | publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 18, 1988 | accessdate=June 4, 2013 | author=Soble, Ronald L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of committees of Club members, including former [[American Smelting and Refining Company]] executive [[Henry Raup Wagner]] and bibliographer Robert Cowan, assembled a list of a hundred books, eventually whittled down to eighty.  During this process, Cowan died, and his ''Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West'' was added to the list as a tribute.&lt;ref name="z80"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/zam80/ | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like [[Mark Twain]], [[John Muir]], [[Bret Harte]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters.  Some of the works exist in very few, highly sought after copies, while others were quite common and not particularly valuable, until interest in the list caused their prices to rise.&lt;ref name="Water2010"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIuC3A4_v_UC | title=The Zamorano 80 Revisited: A Collector's Update of a Classic Work | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | date=April 16, 2010 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Gordon J. Water | page=xi | isbn=978-1-4628-1868-6}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their "Zamorano number" or have special sections dedicated to items on the list.

Thomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list.  His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969.&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;  Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second.  Retired investment counselor Henry H. Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995.  The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann, who completed his collection in 1994, and it was auctioned in 2003.&lt;ref name=volkmann /&gt;&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifford /&gt;  Many other collectors have pursued this goal, including notorious [[bibliomane]] and book thief [[Stephen Blumberg]].&lt;ref name=Madness /&gt;

Only one institution, the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Yale University]], possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80, donated by Frederick W. Beinecke.  Both the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]] possess all but one of the volumes.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/DSIntro.htm | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=Dorothy Sloan Books | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Sloan, Dorothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarest book on the list is number 64, the [[dime novel]] ''[[The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta]]'' by [[John Rollin Ridge]] writing as "Yellow Bird".  Only two first-edition copies are known to exist, each used twice to complete the list.&lt;ref name=sloanJM /&gt;  It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy, which he sold to Streeter.  When Streeter's collection was being periodically auctioned, the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection.  This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke's Zamorano books.&lt;ref name="sloanJM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/64WebA12.htm | title=Auction 12: The Zamorano 80 Collection of Daniel G.

Blumberg wanted it so much he and his accomplices planned and researched a potential burglary of Clifford's house when that collector owned the book.&lt;ref name=Madness /&gt;
