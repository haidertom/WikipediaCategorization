[[File:S7300095.JPG|right|thumb|[[Stonehenge]] is one of the most famous [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] ancient monuments.]]
In British law, an '''ancient monument''' is an early [[history|historical]] structure or [[monument]] (e.g. an [[archaeological site]]) worthy of [[historic preservation|preservation]] and study due to [[Archaeology|archaeological]] or [[cultural heritage|heritage]] interest. The term differs from the American term "[[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]" in that U.S. National Monuments are [[List of National Monuments of the United States|comparatively few in number]] and may include natural formations; British ancient monuments are by definition manmade.

Ancient monuments are defined by the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46/section/61 |title=Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979   |date=4 April 1979 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as
*(a) any [[scheduled monument]] (of which there are currently more than 20,000&lt;ref name="DCMS Scheduled Monuments"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121204113822/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-04 |title= Scheduled Monuments |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |date=March 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and 
*(b) any other monument which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is of public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching to it.

'''Arte Povera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈarte ˈpɔːvera|pron}}; literally ''poor art'') is a [[contemporary art]] movement. The Arte Povera movement took place between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s in major cities throughout Italy and above all in [[Turin]]. Other cities where the movement was also important are [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Naples]] and [[Bologna]]. The term was coined by Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] in 1967&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=J.U-S.|title=Arte Povera’s radical simplicity|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/10/post-war-art|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Arte Povera|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454|work=MoMA: The Collection|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture.

The exhibition "Im Spazio" (The Space of Thoughts), curated by Celant and held at the Galleria La Bertesca in Genoa, Italy, from September through October 1967, is often considered to be the official starting point of Arte Povera.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Celant, who became one of Arte Povera's major proponents, organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book published by Electa in 1985 called ''Arte Povera Storie e protagonisti/Arte Povera. Histories and Protagonists'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place.

Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style. Key figures closely associated with the movement are [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Enrico Castellani]], [[Pier Paolo Calzolari]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Giuseppe Penone]],  [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Emilio Prini]], and [[Gilberto Zorio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4556-6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often used [[found object]]s in their works. Other early exponents of radical change in the visual arts include proto Arte Povera artists: [[Antoni Tàpies]] and the [[Dau al Set]] movement, [[Alberto Burri]], [[Piero Manzoni]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Spatialism]]. Art dealer [[Ileana Sonnabend]] was a champion of the movement.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

==Trends and concepts==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
* A return to simple objects and messages
* The body and behavior are art
* The everyday becomes meaningful
* Traces of nature and industry appear
* Dynamism and energy are embodied in the work
* Nature can be documented in its physical and chemical transformation
* Explore the notion of space and language
* Complex and symbolic signs lose meaning
* Ground Zero, no culture, no art system, Art = Life

==Artists==
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

[[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature. In his ''(Untitled /Twelve Horses)'', Kounellis brings the real, natural life into the gallery setting, by showing twelve horses racked-up on the gallery walls. Recalling the [[Dada]] movement and [[Marcel Duchamp]], his aim was to challenge what could be defined as art, but unlike Duchamp, maintains the objects real and alive, redefining the notion of life and art, while keeping both entities independent.{{Quote | text=The 'reality effect' is not secondary but constitutive.(...)Kounellis shifts the frontier of what can be defined as art, but there is never the idea that art should be dissolved into life. On the contrary, art is given a new message as a rite of initiation through which to re-experience life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Robert|title=Movements in Modern Art, Povera Arte|year=2004|publisher=Tate|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Piero Gilardi]], much like the aim of Arte Povera itself, was concerned with bridging the natural and the artificial. In his ''(Nature Carpets)'', 1965, which gained him recognition and assimilation into the Arte Povera movement, Gilardi built three-dimensional carpets out of [[polyurethane]] which used "natural" leaves, rocks, and soil as decoration, design and art meshed together to question societal sensibilities towards what is real and natural and how artificiality was being engrained into the contemporary commercialized world.

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' ({{lang-de|Bibliographie des Musikschrifttums}}), also known as '''BMS''' or [http://www.musikbibliographie.de:80/LNG=EN/ '''BMS ''online'''''], is an international [[bibliography]] of literature on music. It considers all kind of music and includes both current and older literature. Since 1968, the BMS editorial  staff has been working as the German committee for [[RILM]], too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rilm.org/globalNetwork/country.php?country=Germany RILM National Committee of Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography includes [[monograph]]s, master’s theses and doctoral [[dissertation]]s, articles and reviews from journals, [[Festschrift]]en, [[Proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[yearbook]]s, [[Anthology|anthologies]], and essays from critical reports.

'''BMS ''online''''' participates actively on [[Virtual Library of Musicology|ViFaMusik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamusik.de/literature.html?L=1&amp;cHash=2d26cd0946314ea51422f6a01ed26e4d BMS ''online'' in the Virtual Library of Musicology]&lt;/ref&gt; the central gateway for music and musicology in Germany.

==Format==

'''BMS''' was established in 1936 by the [[State Institute for Music Research]] in Berlin with the aim to list literature on music from all over the world. It was published in print from 1936 through 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiz1.fh-potsdam.de/volltext/diplome/05005.pdf Silvia C. E. Mai, ''Anforderung an eine Datenbank im SIM - Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung'', Berlin 2004, p. 4/ p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is available as '''BMS ''online''''' in a [[Online database|cumulative online database]], which is updated in real-time.

==History==

Established in 1936, the '''BMS''' resumed the bibliographic surveys printed in the [https://archive.org/details/jahrbuchdermusi00petegoog '''Jahrbücher der Musikbibliothek Peters''']. The first '''BMS''' editor was [[Kurt Taut]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Karstädt]]. Originally printed by [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Friedrich Hofmeister]] in Leipzig (Leipzig: Hofmeister, 1936-1941 [volumes 1.1936 to 4.1939]), after a span of four years '''BMS''' was stopped due to wartime limitations. The commencement of this bibliographic enterprise after World War II is owed to the musicologist and librarian [[Wolfgang Schmieder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/musik/mushist.html Wolfgang Schmieder CV in the University Library of Frankfurt a. Main]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the reconstituted [[State Institute for Music Research]] the first volume for 1950/51 appeared in 1954. Since that time the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' has been a regular publication of the [[State Institute for Music Research|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung]]. The last volume in print format was published in 2001 and covered the year 1988 (Frankfurt am Main: [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1954-1968 [volumes 1.1950/51 to 6.1960], Mainz: [[Schott Music|Schott]], 1969-2001 [volumes 1961 to 1988]). Since 2006, there has been the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' as '''BMS ''online'''''.

A '''bill of attainder''' (also known as an '''act of attainder''' or '''writ of attainder''' or '''bill of pains and penalties''') is an act of a [[legislature]] declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with [[attainder]] resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's [[civil rights]], most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry Vlll on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.

The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to [[due process]], the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the [[separation of powers]].

==Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Unlike the United States Constitution, there is no specific provision prohibiting the Commonwealth Government from passing bills of attainder. However, the [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that bills of attainder are unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for any body other than a Chapter III court to wield judicial power.&lt;ref name="Wheat case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1915|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 54] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Communist case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1951|litigants=[[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.pdf (1951) 83 CLR 1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1956|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the core aspects of judicial power is the ability to make binding and authoritative decisions on questions of law, that is, issues relating to life, liberty or property.&lt;ref name="Huddart"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1909|litigants=[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909)&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;330] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyukhovich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|32|1991|litigants=[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]] (War Crimes Act case) |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wielding of judicial power by the legislative or executive branch includes the direct wielding of power and the indirect wielding of judicial power.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1992|litigants=[[Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state constitutions in Australia contain few limitations on government power. Bills of attainder are considered permissible because there is no entrenched separation of powers at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers Federation of New South Wales v Minister of Industrial Relations'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 372, [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|46|1994|litigants=City of Collingwood v Victoria [No2] |parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 652 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[section 77 of the Constitution of Australia]] permits state courts to be invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction, and any state law that renders a state court unable to function as Chapter III court (Commonwealth jurisdiction) is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1996|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]] |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The States cannot structure their legal systems to prevent them from being subject to the Australian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]] |parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important distinction is that laws seeking to direct judicial power (e.g. must make orders)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|49|2009|litigants=International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission (Criminal Assets Recovery case) |parallelcite=(2009) 240 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 319 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are unconstitutional, but laws that concern mandatory sentencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NTSC|120|1997|litigants=Wynbyne v Marshall |parallelcite=(1997) 99 {{abbr|A Crim R|Australian Criminal Reports}} 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Moffatt'' [1998] 2 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 229, [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Vic, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; rules of evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1998|litigants=Nicholas v The Queen |parallelcite=(1998) 193 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 173 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; non-punitive imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1998|litigants=Fardon v Attorney-General (QLD) |parallelcite=(2004) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or tests,&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
In two cases of attempts to pass bills (in 1984 for [[Clifford Olson]] and in 1995 for [[Karla Homolka]]) to inflict a judicial penalty on a specific person, the speakers of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], respectively, have ruled that Canadian parliamentary practice does not permit bills of attainder or bills of pains and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 32nd Parliament, 2nd Session, 14 May 1984 {{cite web|title=Debates of the House of Commons: "An Act respecting the execution of Clifford Robert Olson|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC3202_03/1321?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2015|page=3683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 35th Parliament, 1st Session, 28 November 1995 {{cite web|title=Debates of the Senate: "Bill Concerning Karla Homolka|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_SOC3501_02/366?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2014|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Usage under English law====
The word "[[attainder]]", meaning "taintedness", is part of English [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;The word "attainder" does not, in fact, derive from a Latin expression meaning "tainted", but from a French expression meaning "to attain", in the sense of condemn. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/12725?redirectedFrom=attainder#eid&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, a criminal condemned for a serious crime, whether [[treason]] or [[felony]] (but not [[misdemeanor|misdemeanour]], which referred to less serious crimes), could be declared "attainted", meaning that his civil rights were nullified: he could no longer own property or pass property to his family by will or testament. His property could consequently revert to the Crown or to the [[mesne lord]]. Any [[peerage]] titles would also revert to the Crown. The convicted person would normally be punished by [[execution (legal)|judicial execution]]—when a person committed a capital crime and was put to death for it, the property left behind [[escheat]]ed to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. Attainder functioned more or less as the revocation of the feudal chain of privilege and all rights and properties thus granted.

Due to [[mandatory sentencing]], the due process of the courts provided limited flexibility to deal with the various circumstances of offenders. The property of criminals caught alive and put to death because of a guilty plea or jury conviction on a not guilty plea could be forfeited, as could the property of those who escaped justice and were outlawed; but the property of offenders who died before trial, except those killed during the commission of crimes (who fell foul of the law relating to ''[[felo de se]]''), could not be forfeited, nor could the property of offenders who refused to plead and who were tortured to death through ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.

On the other hand, when a legal conviction did take place, confiscation and "corruption of blood" sometimes appeared unduly harsh for the surviving family. In some cases (at least regarding the peerage) the Crown would eventually re-grant the convicted peer's lands and titles to his heir. It was also possible, as political fortunes turned, for a bill of attainder to be reversed. This sometimes occurred long after the convicted person was executed.

Unlike the mandatory sentences of the courts, acts of Parliament provided considerable latitude in suiting the punishment to the particular conditions of the offender's family. Parliament could also impose non-capital punishments without involving courts; such bills are called '''bills of pains and penalties'''.

Bills of attainder were sometimes criticised as a convenient way for the [[British monarchy|King]] to convict subjects of crimes and confiscate their property without the bother of a trial – and without the need for a conviction or indeed any evidence at all.

The first use of attainder was in 1321 against both [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester]] and his son [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester]]. They were both attainted for supporting [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] during his struggle with the [[Isabella of France|queen]] and barons.

In England, those executed subject to attainders include [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] (1478); [[Thomas Cromwell]] (1540); [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]] (1540); [[Catherine Howard]] (1542); Baron [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (1549); [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke Thomas Howard of Norfolk]] (1572); [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl Thomas Wentworth of Strafford]] (1641); Archbishop [[William Laud]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (1645); and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke James Scott of Monmouth]]. In the case of Catherine Howard, in 1541 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the first monarch to delegate [[Royal Assent]], to avoid having to assent personally to the execution of his wife.

After defeating [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and replacing him on the throne of England, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] had Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/richard-iii-the-truth-may-yet-be-discovered-8142320.html|title=Richard III: The truth may yet be discovered|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that this bill made no mention of the [[Princes in the Tower]], although it does declare him guilty of "shedding of Infants blood."&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard IIIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|ref=Kendall|title=[[Richard III (biography)|Richard the Third]]|authorlink=Paul Murray Kendall|publisher=[[W.

Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]). After the committee stages, the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day:&lt;ref name="british-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 15 May 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26317 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 4 December 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26867 |title=Index: A-J &amp;#124; British History Online &amp;#124; ''Journal of the House of Commons:'' volume 8 |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, when the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth| Duke of Monmouth]] landed in West England and started [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] in an effort to overthrow his uncle, the recently enthroned [[James II of England|James II]], Parliament passed an bill of attainder against him. After the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], this made it possible for King James to have the captured Monmouth put summarily to death. Though  legal, this was regarded by many as an arbitrary and ruthless act.

In 1753, the Jacobite leader [[Archibald Cameron of Locheil]] was summarily put to death on the basis of a seven-year-old bill of attainder, rather than being put on trial for his recent subversive activities in Scotland. This aroused some protests in British public opinion at the time, including from people with no Jacobite sympathies.

The last use of attainder was in 1798 against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]] for leading the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

====The Great Act of Attainder====
In 1688, King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland), driven off by the ascent of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], came to Ireland with the sole purpose of reclaiming his throne. After his arrival, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] assembled a list of names in 1689 of those reported to have been disloyal to him, eventually tallying between two and three thousand, in a bill of attainder. Those on the list were to report to Dublin for sentencing. One man, [[William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Lord Mountjoy]], was in the [[Bastille]] at the time and was told by the Irish Parliament that he must break out of his cell and make it back to Ireland for his punishment, or face the grisly process of being [[Drawing and quartering|drawn and quartered]].&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, ''History of England from the Accession of James the Second'' (London, 1855), 216–220&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament became known in the 1800s as the "[[Patriot Parliament]]".

Later defenders of the Patriot Parliament pointed out that the ensuing "[[Treaty of Limerick#The Williamite Settlement forfeitures|Williamite Settlement forfeitures]]" of the 1690s named an even larger number of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] suspects, most of whom had been attainted by 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E800002-045/index.html TO Davis, "The Irish Parliament of James II"], 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private bills====
{{main article|Private bill}}
{{About|legislation that affects a specific person|legislation proposed by a single MP|Private member's bill|section=yes}}

In the Westminster system (and especially in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term "private bill" (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act). Note however that "private bill" is a general term referring to a proposal for legislation applying to a specific person; it is only a bill of attainder if it punishes them; private bills have been used in some Commonwealth countries to effect divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Millar and Sheldon Goldenberg (1998). "Explaining Child Custody Determinations in Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Law and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 1, p. 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional uses of private bills include chartering corporations, changing the charters of existing corporations, granting monopolies, approving of public infrastructure and seizure of property for those, as well as enclosure of commons and similar redistributions of property. Those types of private bills operate to take away private property and rights from certain individuals, but are usually not called "bill of pains and penalties".

The last United Kingdom bill called a "Pains and Penalties Bill" was [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]] and was passed by the House of Lords in 1820, but not considered by the House of Commons; it sought to divorce [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] from King George IV and adjust her titles and property accordingly, on grounds of her alleged adultery, as did many private bills dealing with divorces of private persons.

It has been reported that no bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 at 97'' (Univ. of Kans. Press, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Attainder as such was also a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.&lt;ref name="british-civil-wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/impeachment-attainder.htm |title=BCW Project :: British Civil Wars, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Protectorate 1638-1660 &amp;#124; Impeachment &amp; Attainder |author=David Plant|publisher=british-civil-wars.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
Previously secret British [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]] papers released on 1 January 2006 have shown that, as early as December 1942, the War Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] had then advocated a policy of [[summary execution]] with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles. He was dissuaded by cabinet minister [[Richard Law, 1st Baron Coleraine|Richard Law]] who pointed out that the United States and Soviet Union still favoured trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Crossland [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article210371.ece "Churchill: execute Hitler without trial"], ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/nurnbergtrial.html Holocaust Education and Archive Research Team], "The 1st Nuremberg Trial"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Colonial era ====
Bills of attainder were used through the 18th century in England, and were applied to British colonies as well. Some colonists were inspired to the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] because of anger at the injustice of attainder. Although at least one American state used a bill of attainder to confiscate the property of a British [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalist]] (called [[Tory|Tories]]) during the war (New York, in the 1779 case of [[Parker Wickham]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker Wickham (1727–1785)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/parker.htm|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1789.

==== Constitutional bans ====
[[File:Constitution Pg2of4 AC-attainder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Excerpt from Article One, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the passing of bills of attainder]]

The [[United States Constitution]] forbids legislative bills of attainder: in federal law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]], and in state law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]]. The fact that they were banned even under state law reflects the importance that the framers attached to this issue.

Within the U.S. Constitution, the clauses forbidding attainder laws serve two purposes. First, they reinforced the [[separation of powers]], by forbidding the legislature to perform [[judiciary|judicial]] or executive functions—since the outcome of any such acts of legislature would of necessity take the form of a bill of attainder. Second, they embody the concept of [[due process]], which was partially reinforced by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution. The text of the Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 is "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed".

The constitution of every state also expressly forbids bills of attainder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} For example, [[Wisconsin Constitution|Wisconsin's constitution]] Article I, Section 12 reads:

{{quote|No bill of attainder, [[ex post facto law]], nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed, and no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.}}

Contrast this with the Texas version: Article 1 (Titled Bill of Rights) Section 16, entitled ''Bills of Attainder; Ex Post Facto or Retroactive Laws: Impairing Obligation of Contracts'': "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made". It is unclear whether a contract that calls for heirs to be deprived of their estate is allowed under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Reynolds |title=The Rule of Law and the Origins of the Bill of Attainder Clause |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stlr18&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |journal=St. Thomas Law Review |year=2005 |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases before the U.S. Supreme Court ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on only five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Nonattainder as a Liberty Interest", ''Wisconsin Law Review'', 2010, p. 1229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]'s first decisions on the meaning of the bill of attainder clause came after the [[American Civil War]]. In ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1866), the court struck down a federal law requiring attorneys practising in federal court to swear that they had not supported the rebellion. In ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867), the [[Missouri]] constitution required anyone seeking a professional's license from the state to swear they had not supported the rebellion. The Supreme Court overturned the law and the constitutional provision, arguing that the people already admitted to practice were subject to penalty without judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hart Ely|Ely, John H.]] ''On Constitutional Ground''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of judicial trial was the critical affront to the Constitution, the Court said.&lt;ref&gt;Nabers, Deak. ''Victory of Law: The Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil War, and American Literature, 1852–1867''. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, however, the Court upheld similar laws. In ''[[Hawker v. New York]]'', 170 U.S. 189 (1898), a state law barred convicted felons from practising medicine. In ''[[Dent v. West Virginia]]'', 129 U.S. 114 (1889), a state law imposed a new requirement that practising physicians had to have graduated from a licensed medical school or they would be forced to surrender their license. The Court upheld both laws because, it said, the laws were narrowly tailored to focus on an individual's qualifications to practice medicine.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Theodore. ''The Second Amendment Controversy—Explained.'' 2d ed. Indianapolis: iUniverse, 2002, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; That was not true in ''Garland'' or ''Cummings''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond481483"&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause". ''Virginia Law Review''. 70:475 (April 1984), p. 481-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court changed its "bill of attainder test" in 1946. In ''[[United States v. Lovett]]'', 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Court confronted a federal law that named three people as subversive and excluded them from federal employment. Previously, the Court had held that lack of judicial trial and the narrow way in which the law rationally achieved its goals were the only tests of a bill of attainder. But the ''Lovett'' Court said that a bill of attainder 1) specifically identified the people to be punished; 2) imposed punishment; and 3) did so without benefit of judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Robert Fairchild and Koniak, Susan P. ''Cases in Civil Liberties''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Washington, D.C.: Heritage Foundation, 2005, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; As all three prongs of the bill of attainder test were met in ''Lovett'', the court held that a congressional statute that bars particular individuals from government employment qualifies as punishment prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.

The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] (enacted in 1947) sought to ban [[strike action|political strikes]] by [[Communism|Communist]]-dominated [[trade union|labour unions]] by requiring all elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the [[Communist Party USA]], and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government. It also made it a crime for members of the Communist Party to serve on executive boards of labour unions. In ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]'', 339 U.S. 382 (1950), the Supreme Court had said that the requirement for the oath was not a bill of attainder because: 1) anyone could avoid punishment by disavowing the Communist Party, and 2) it focused on a future act (overthrow of the government) and not a past one.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;Welsh, Jane. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process". ''Brooklyn Law Review''. 50:77 (Fall 1983), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting current fears, the Court commented in ''Douds'' on approving the specific focus on Communists by noting what a threat communism was.&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, William M. ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States: The Birth of the Modern Constitution: The United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953''. New York: Macmillan, 2006, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had added an "escape clause" test to determining whether a law was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Brown]]'', 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Court invalidated the section of the statute that criminalized a former communist serving on a union's executive board. Clearly, the Act had focused on past behaviour and had specified a specific class of people to be punished. But if this specific focus in ''Brown'' was constitutionally invalid, why was it ''not'' constitutionally invalid in ''Douds''?&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause", ''Virginia Law Review'', April 1984, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; (Many legal scholars assumed that the ''Brown'' case effectively, if not officially, overruled ''Douds''.)&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Victor. ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court did not apply the punishment prong of its test, leaving legal scholars confused as to whether the Court still intended it to apply.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process", ''Brooklyn Law Review'', Fall 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court emphasised the narrowness and rationality of bills of attainder in ''[[Nixon v. Administrator of General Services]]'', 433 U.S. 425 (1977). During the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Congress passed the [[Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act]], which required the [[General Services Administration]] to confiscate former President [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidential papers to prevent their destruction, screen out those which contained national security and other issues which might prevent their publication, and release the remainder of the papers to the public as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Anthony. "U.S. Judge Rules Nixon Documents Belong to Nation", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld the law in ''Nixon'', arguing that specificity alone did not invalidate the act because the President constituted a "class of one".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;Stark, Jack. ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution''. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2002, p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, specificity was constitutional if it was rationally related to the class identified.&lt;ref name="Stark" /&gt; The Court modified its punishment test, concluding that only those laws which historically offended the bill of attainder clause were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also found it significant that Nixon was compensated for the loss of his papers, which alleviated the punishment.&lt;ref name="Stark75"&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court modified the punishment prong by holding that punishment could survive scrutiny if it was rationally related to other, nonpunitive goals.&lt;ref name="Stark75" /&gt; Finally, the Court concluded that the legislation must not be intended to punish; legislation enacted for otherwise legitimate purposes could be saved so long as punishment was a side-effect rather than the main purpose of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases considered by lower courts ====
A number of cases which raised the bill of attainder issue did not reach or have not reached the Supreme Court, but were considered by lower courts.

In 1990, in the wake of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], Congress enacted the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990|Oil Pollution Act]] to consolidate various oil spill and oil pollution statutes into a single unified law, and to provide for a statutory regime for handling oil spill cleanup. This law was challenged as a bill of attainder by the shipping division of [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref&gt;''SeaRiver Maritime Fin. Holdings, Inc. v. Pena'', 952 F.Supp. 9, D.D.C. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carringan, Alison C. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990", ''Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review'' 28:119 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] struck down the [[Elizabeth Morgan Act]] as a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;''Doris R. Foretich, et al. v. United States'', 351 F.3d 1198 (D.C.App. 2003); Leonning, Carol D. "Appeals Court Rules Against Morgan Law", ''Washington Post'' 17 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution in late 2009 barring the community organising group [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) from receiving federal funding, the group sued the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/nyregion/13acorn.html "Acorn Sues Over Funding Vote in House"]. ''New York Times'', 12 November 2009. Accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, broader bill, the Defund ACORN Act, was enacted by Congress later that year. In March 2010, a federal district court declared the funding ban an unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Michael B. "Funding Gone, Scandal-Plagued ACORN to Disband". ''Christian Science Monitor'', 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute "punishment".&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Rules Against Acorn". Associated Press: 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACORN v. United States|url = http://harvardlawreview.org/2011/01/second-circuit-holds-that-law-barring-acorn-from-receiving-federal-funding-is-not-a-bill-of-attainder-ae-acorn-v-united-states-618-f-3d-125-2d-cir-2010/|website = ACORN v. United States|accessdate = 23 July 2015|date = 20 January 2011|publisher = Harvard Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible cases ====
There is argument over whether the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] in the [[Terri Schiavo case]] was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven G. "The Terri Schiavo Case: In Defense of the Special Law Enacted by Congress and President Bush", ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 100:1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGough, Michael. "Terri's Law: Is It Constitutional?" ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 22 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Jr., Thomas C. "Terri Schiavo and the Law", ''Albany Law Review'' 67:843 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts considered a proposed Congressional bill to confiscate 90 percent of the bonus money paid to executives at federally rescued investment bank [[American International Group]] a bill of attainder, although disagreement exists on the issue. The bill was not passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ashby. "Would an AIG-Bonus Tax Pass Constitutional Muster? (A Tribe Calls 'Yes!')" ''Wall Street Journal'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Connor. "No Bill of Attainder... Shall Be Passed". ''The Atlantic'', 16 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the City of Portland's attempt to prosecute more severely those on a "secret list" of 350 individuals deemed by police to have committed "liveability crimes" in certain neighbourhoods was challenged as unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/secret-list-on-trial/Content?oid=1055123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.streetroots.org/2009/03/11/two-more-cases-add-list-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the House voted to defund [[Planned Parenthood]]. Democratic Representative [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]] called that vote a bill of attainder, saying it was unconstitutional as such because the legislation was targeting a specific group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House votes to defund Planned Parenthood - David Nather and Kate Nocera|url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49830.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = David Nather and Kate|last = Nocera|date = 18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the House reinstated the [[Holman Rule]], a procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reduce the pay of an individual federal worker down to $1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/the-holman-rule-once-allowed-congress-to-purge-leftists-from-government-agencies-now-its-back/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Institute of the Arts''' ('''CalArts''') is a private university in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing art]]s. It offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees among six schools: Art; Critical Studies; Dance; Film/Video; Music; and Theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including [[Nelbert Chouinard|Nelbert Murphy Chouinard]], a founder of [[Chouinard Art Institute]], [[Walt Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushkoff | first = Douglas | title =Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | year = 1995 | page = 102| isbn = 0-345-39774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students develop their own work, over which they retain control and copyright, in a workshop atmosphere.

As of 2017, the school has a 27.5% acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/about/institute/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[US News &amp; World Report]] has CalArts ranked #9 of "Best Graduate Fine Arts Programs." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CalArts was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (founded 1921) and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (founded 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://calarts.edu/about/history | title=CalArts: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial difficulties around the same time, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert Chouinard, was mortally ill. The professional relationship between Madame Chouinard and Walt Disney began in 1929 when Disney had no money and Madame Chouinard agreed to train Disney's first animators on a pay-later basis. It was through the vision of Disney, who discovered and trained many of his studio artists at Chouinard (including [[Mary Blair]], [[Maurice Noble]] and some of the [[Nine Old Men]], among others), that the merger of the two institutions was coordinated; the process continued after his death in 1966.&lt;ref name="RootsLAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/entertainment/ca-100_1_robert-perine-calarts-herbert-blau |title=The Roots of CalArts | accessdate=18 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining him were his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects), of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. The original board of trustess at CalArts included  [[Harrison Price]], [[Retlaw Enterprises| Royal Clark]], Robert W. Corrigan,  [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Roy O. Disney]], film producer Z. Wayne Griffin, [[H. R. Haldeman]], Ralph Hetzel (then vice-president of [[Motion Picture Association of America]]), [[Chuck Jones]], Ronald Miller, [[Millard Sheets]], attorney Maynard Toll, bank executive G. Robert Truex Jr. , [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Meredith Willson]], Peter McBean and Scott Newhall (descendants of [[Henry Newhall]]),  and the wives of [[Roswell Gilpatric]], J.L. Hurschler, Richard R. Von Hagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tn6902b.htm| title=Program: CalArts Groundbreaking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Alumni Association was founded as a nonprofit organization and was governed by a 12-member board of directors to serve the best interests of the institute and its programs. Members included leading professional artists and musicians, who contributed their knowledge, experience and skill to strengthen the institute. The 12 founding board of directors members were [[Mary Costa]], [[Edith Head]], [[Gale Storm]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Tony Duquette]], [[Harold Grieve]], [[John Hench]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Marty Paich]], [[Nelson Riddle]] and [[Millard Sheets]].

The ground-breaking for CalArts' current campus took place May 3, 1969. However, construction of the new campus was hampered by torrential rains, labor troubles and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|earthquake in 1971]]. CalArts moved to its present campus in the [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] section of the city of [[Santa Clarita, California]] in November 1971. From the beginning, CalArts was plagued by the tensions between its art and trade school functions as well as between the non-commercial aspirations of the students and faculty and the conservative interests of the Disney family and trustees. The founding board of trustees originally planned on creating CalArts as a school in an entertainment complex, a destination like Disneyland, and a feeder school for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://clancco.com/wp/2007/01/intervview_sergio-muoz-sarmiento_cal-arts_law/| title=Interview with Tom Lawson, Dean of CalArts School of Art, January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model is exemplified in the 1941 Disney film [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]. In an ironic turn of fate, they appointed Dr. Robert W. Corrigan as the first president of the Institute.

Corrigan, former dean of the School of Arts at [[New York University]] fired almost all the artists and teachers from Chouinard in his attempt to remake CalArts into his personal vision. [[Herbert Blau]] was hired as the Institute's provost and dean of the School of Theater and Dance. Subsequently, Blau was instrumental in hiring a number of professionals like [[Mel Powell]] (dean of the School of Music), [[Paul Brach]] (dean of the School of Art), [[Alexander Mackendrick]] (dean of the School of Film/Video), sociologist [[Maurice R. Stein]] (dean of Critical Studies), and [[Richard Farson]] (dean of the School of Design; now integrated in the Art school as the Graphic Design program), as well as other influential program heads and teachers such as Stephan von Huene, [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Bella Lewitzky]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Jules Engel]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Max Kozloff]], [[Miriam Shapiro]], [[Douglas Huebler]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Norman M. Klein]] and [[Nam June Paik]]  most of whom largely came from a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[avant-garde]] side of the art world. The fundamental principles established at the Institute by Blau and the late Corrigan included ideas like “no technique in advance of need,” and that a curriculum should be cyclical rather than sequential, returning to root principles at regular intervals, and that “we’re a community of artists here, some of us called faculty and some called students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.robertbenedetti.com/AwardSpeech.htm | title=Robert Benedetti-Acceptance speech for athe career achievement award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan held his position until 1972, when he was replaced by William S. Lund, a Disney son-in-law. Within a month of Lund's tenure as president, 55 of CalArts' 325 faculty and staff were fired. Structured schedules were introduced. Classes were trimmed back and, within a year, the Institute was operating on budget. Some credit Lund with saving CalArts. Others see his tenure as the end of an idealistic experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1889_1_walt-disney/2 |title=A Tradition of Tradition-Be-Damned  | accessdate=17 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Wharton | date=April 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert J. Fitzpatrick]] was appointed new president of CalArts. Holding this position for 12 years, in 1987
Fitzpatrick resigned as president to head [[Euro Disney S.C.A|Euro Disney]] in Paris. Nicholas England, former dean of the School of Music, was appointed acting president. One year later, [[Steven Lavine]], associate director for arts and humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation, was named new president.

On June 24, 2015 Steven D. Lavine announced he would step down as President of the California Institute of the Arts in May 2017, after an unprecedented 29-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-calarts-column-20150624-story.html|title=CalArts President Steven D.

Rajan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://president.calarts.edu|title=Introducing the next President at CalArts — Ravi Rajan|website=Introducing the next President at CalArts|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of the School of the Arts at the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] was unanimously elected as President, to begin in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-ravi-rajan-calarts-20161213-story.html|title=CalArts names Ravi Rajan president, the first Asian American to be named to the post|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the summer of 1987, CalArts became the host of the state-funded [[California State Summer School for the Arts]] (CSSSA) program. It began as a program to nurture talented high school students in the fields of [[animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[music]], [[theatre arts]], and [[visual arts]]. CalArts expanded on the concept by creating the [[Community Arts Partnership]] in 1990. While CSSSA is open to qualifying California students, CAP, as it is commonly known, is a service provided to students living within underprivileged communities in the Los Angeles County school system. Many CalArts faculty and students mentor the high school students in both programs.

In 1994, [[Herb Alpert]], a professional musician and admirer of the Institute, established the [[Alpert Awards in the Arts]] in collaboration with CalArts and his nonprofit the Herb Alpert Foundation. While the foundation provides the award for winning recipients, the school's faculty in the fields film/new media, visual arts, theatre, dance, and music select artists in their field to nominate an individual artist who is recognized for their innovation in their given medium. Recipients of this award are required to stay for a week as visiting artists at CalArts and mentor students studying their metier. In 2008, CalArts renamed the School of Music in his name, courtesy of a $15 million donation.

Over the years, the school has also developed on-campus, interdisciplinary laboratories, such as the [[Center for Experiments in Art, Information, and Technology]], [[Center for Integrated Media]], [[Center for New Performance at CalArts]], and the Cotsen Center for Puppetry and the Arts.

==Academics==
CalArts offers degree programs in [[music]], [[art]], [[Contemporary dance|dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[animation]], [[Experimental theatre|theater]], [[puppetry]], and [[creative writing|writing]].  Students receive intensive professional training in the area of their career purpose without being cast into a rigid pattern. Its focus is in [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[contemporary art]], and the Institute's stated mission is to develop professional artists of tomorrow- artists who will change their field.  With these goals in place, the Institute encourages students to recognize the complexity of political, social and aesthetic questions and to respond to them with informed, independent judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alpertawards.org/about/calarts | title=CalArts Statement }} for {{cite web | url=http://www.alpertawards.org/ | title=The Alpert Award in the Arts }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
Every school within the Institute requires that applicants send in an [[artist's statement]], along with a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] or [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] (depending on the Program) in order to be considered for admission. The school does not review an applicant's [[SAT]] scores without consent of the applicant, and does not consider an applicant's [[GPA]] as part of the admission process.

In a 2016 interview, design program faculty member Michael Worthington was asked "'''What kinds of students do best at CalArts?''', to which he responded, ''Energetic, enthusiastic, self-motivated, fast learners, idiosyncratic aesthetes, verbal and visual adventurers, risk takers, those who are smart and vocal with a critical eye for their own work and the work of others. Having technical, formal and typographical skills helps, but we can teach those things. Raw intelligence and criticality and an adventurous side matter more at the start. Above all, the students that do best are those that are committed to design and who are willing to put the time and energy into their own development and learning.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motionographer.com/2016/02/18/school-profile-calarts/ |title=School Profile: CalArts | accessdate=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception and foundation===
The initial concept behind CalArts' interdisciplinary approach came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("total artwork"), which Disney himself was fond of and explored in a variety of forms, beginning with his own studio, then later in the incorporation of CalArts. He began with the classic Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), where animators, dancers, composers, and artists alike collaborated. In 1952, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] was founded, where Disney integrated artists from his animation studio and elsewhere, as well as formally trained engineers and achieved creative critical mass in the development of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. He believed that the same concept that developed WDI, could also be applied to a university setting, where art students of different mediums would be exposed to and explore a wide range of creative directions. Disney himself has stated of his memorial school:

{{cquote|If you keep busy, your work might lead you into paths you might not expect. I’ve always operated like the [[The Three Princes of Serendip|princes of Serendip]], who went on quests not knowing what they would find.  That happens in science; some of our most important discoveries have come from scientists who were searching for something else. What young artists need is a school where they can learn a variety of skills, a place where there is cross-pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calarts.edu/~alumni/reunion/Images/Current_Insert.pdf |title=CalArts 30th Anniversary speech |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarkable thing that’s taking place in almost every field of endeavor is an accelerating rate of dynamic growth and change. The arts, which have historically symbolized the advance of human progress, must match this growth if they are going to maintain their value in and influence on society.  The talents of musicians, the self-expression of the actor, and the techniques and applications of fine and commercial artist are being use more and more in today's business-not by themselves but rather, in close association with each other. What we must have, then, is a completely new approach to training in the arts-an entirely new educational concept which will properly prepare artists and give them the vital tools so necessary for working in, and drawing from, every field of creativity and performance. I like the workshop idea, with students being able to drop in and learn all kinds of arts. A school should offer a kind of cross-pollination that would develop the best in its students. That is the direction I would like CalArts to take. It shouldn’t be a school where studies are rigid and narrow. Students should be able to study the whole spectrum of the arts.  Perhaps a musician would find he is more talented in arts; and vice versa. There is an urgent need for a professional school which will not only give its students thorough training in a specific field, but will also allow the widest possible range of artistic growth and expression. To meet this need is exactly why California Institute of the Arts has been created, and why we all believe so strongly in its importance. Students will be able to take anything - art, drama, music, dance, writing. They'll graduate with a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, and if they want a Bachelor of Arts they can go to other colleges and acquire a few more credits. The student body of CalArts shouldn't be over two thousand, and as many as possible should reside on campus. There should be some allowance for those who are talented, yet are not students; they should be able to express themselves without worrying about grades. There will be a lot of scholarships at CalArts. Those who can pay will pay; those who can't will get scholarships. We don't want any dilettantes at CalArts. We want people with talent. That will be the one factor in getting into CalArts: talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030707181300/http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archivedate= 2003-07-07 | title="What about an Integrated School?

==Facilities==

===Walt Disney Modular Theatre===
The Walt Disney Modular Theatre is an indoor performance space located within the California Institute of the Arts.

Funded by Lillian Disney, who lent support to Walt's venture into education, her gift to the school to remodel a campus theater and rename it the Walt Disney Modular Theatre in 1993. The modular theater is based on a concept suggested by [[Antonin Artaud]], who asserted that the ideal theater could be reconfigured for each and every new performance or play. When [[Walt Disney]] founded his Institute of the Arts, he requested suggestions from leaders in various artistic fields as to what would be the ideal tools for advancing the study and practice of their medium. One of the overwhelmingly popular suggestions from the theater community was a modular theater as suggested by Artaud. Disney had the Modular Theatre incorporated as the central performance space of his Institute. It was the first of its kind constructed, and remains one of only five in the world.

The chief feature of the theater is a segmented floor, divided into 348 4'x4' square platforms, each mounted on its own independent pneumatic pistons, allowing the floor to be reconfigured into whatever shape is desired. The theater is also composed of segmented pieces, so that walls can also be easily reconfigured, creating a virtually limitless number of possibilities in design. The theater is two stories tall from floor to ceiling—the [[pneumatic]] pistons reach another story down into the CalArts library, where they are a dominating architectural feature. There are doors on all sides of the theater so that the audience can be made to enter from whatever direction the artists choose. The theater can be divided into several playing spaces, the audience can be separated into several sections, and any combination of levels and directions can be used. The theater can also be configured into an environmental space, with the audience moving through multiple locations in the course of a show, or being presented with a virtual environment rather than one in which they are separate from the performance.

The Walt Disney Modular Theater is employed year-round by students and faculty at the CalArts, primarily those in the schools of Theater, Dance, and Music. Though the idea of modular theater has fallen out of fashion, in favor of environmental theater and the resurgence of [[proscenium]] spectacle theater, the theater remains in use, run by the Technical Direction Department, including both students and faculty.

It was designed by Fisher Dachs Associates, a collaboration between the Dean of the Theater School, [[Herbert Blau]], lighting designer [[Jules Fisher]], and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects).

===A113===

A113 is an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] that has been inserted into several animated television shows and feature films as a homage to a classroom at CalArts.

===Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall===
{{main|REDCAT}}

In 2003, CalArts established a performance theater in downtown Los Angeles called REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Center for New Performance, the professional producing arm of the CalArts Theater School, brings works to the space from both student and professional artists and musicians.

===Wild Beast===

In fall 2009, the Institute opened an on-campus music pavilion, known as the "Wild Beast". The {{convert|3200|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, free-standing structure serves as a space for classrooms and combined indoor-outdoor performance space. CalArts' President Steven Lavine has stated, “The core demand is that our Herb Alpert School of Music has doubled in size in the last decade; when we have guest artists, there is no place for them to perform&amp;mdash;And the second reason was to allow enough space for the general public to attend [...]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/calarts-is-addi.html |title=CalArts is adding a Wild Beast to its menagerie | accessdate=19 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Baldessari Art Studio Building===
In 2013, CalArts opened its John Baldessari Art Studio Building, which cost $3.1 million to build and features approximately 7,000 square feet of space—much of it used as studio space for art students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;David Ng (November 29, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127,0,7368564.story#ixzz2mLsg6Nv6 CalArts names new art studio building after John Baldessari]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206093355/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127%2C0%2C7368564.story |date=February 6, 2014 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and cultural influence==

In 2011, [[Newsweek]]/The Daily Beast listed CalArts as the top school for arts-minded students. The ranking was not aimed to assess the country's best art school, but rather to assess campuses that offer an exceptional artistic atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Ziemba |first=Christine N.|title=Newsweek/Daily Beast Ranks CalArts as Nation’s Most ‘Artistic’ College|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2011/08/30/newsweekdaily-beast-ranks-calarts-as-nations-most-artistic-college/|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=CalArts 24700|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng|first=David|title=CalArts named top school for arts-minded students|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/09/calarts-named-top-arts-school-in-new-ranking.html|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the Valencia campus, as [[Lillian Disney]] turned over the first shovel full of soil, director [[Bob Clampett]] stood behind her mugging for the flashing cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sito|first=Tom|title=Walt’s Jalopy: Animator Training through the Decades |url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walt-s-jalopy-animator-training-through-decades|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several students who attended CalArts' animation programs in the 1970s eventually found work at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and several of those went on to successful careers at Disney, [[Pixar]], and other animation studios.  In March 2014, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine highlighted the success of CalArts' 1970s animation alumni and briefly profiled several (including [[Jerry Rees]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Tim Burton]], [[John Musker]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], [[Henry Selick]] and [[Nancy Beiman]]) in an article illustrated with a group portrait taken by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] inside classroom [[A113]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=The Class That Roared|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/calarts-animation-1970s-tim-burton|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties, a group of CalArts animation students contacted animation director [[Ralph Bakshi]]. As he was in the process of moving to New York, they persuaded him to stay in Los Angeles to continue to produce [[adult animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wharton|first=David|title=Ralph Bakshi Works Still Getting People Animated  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-27/entertainment/ca-6468_1_ralph-bakshi-works|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi then got the production rights to the cartoon character [[Mighty Mouse]]. By Bakshi's request, [[Tom Minton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] then went to the CalArts campus to recruit the best talent from what was the recent group of graduates. They hired [[Jeff Pidgeon]], [[Rich Moore]], Carole Holiday, [[Andrew Stanton]] and Nate Kanfer to work on the then-new ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Scott|title=Q&amp;A: Toon Titan John Kricfalusi Hails Mighty Mouse Rebirth  |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/john-kricfalusi/ |newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Craig "Spike" Decker of [[Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation]] commented on the work of independent animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] stating that Hertzfeldt demonstrated good instincts coupled with his lack of interest in the world of commerce. In making a comparison, Decker made a reference to CalArts stating: "A lot of animators come out of CalArts — they could be so prolific, but then they're owned by Disney or someone, and they're painting the fins on the Little Mermaid. You'll never see their full potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Scott|title=Don Hertzfeldt is the most inventive underground animator in America. Will he ever make his peace with Hollywood? |url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/articles-e.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=New Times L.A. |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, members of the band [[Sonic Youth]], remarked in an interview with [[VH1]] about the band [[Liars (band)|Liars]], of which Angus Andrew and Julian Gross are CalArts luminaries. Moore's initial remarks were: "There's this whole world of young people who [think] everything's allowed. What Liars are doing right now is completely crazy. I saw them the other night and it was really great. It's really out-there". Gordon then stated "I'm not so crazy about the way [the Liars' They Were Wrong, So We Drowned] sounds. It's like 'how lo-fi can we make it?' But I think the content is really good". In reference to CalArts and Gordon's statement, Moore lastly remarked "They're art kids. They came out of CalArts and that's the kind of sensibility you have when you come out of these sort of places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bottomley |first=C. |title=Sonic Youth: Medicine For Your Ear |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |accessdate=9 March 2015 |newspaper=VH1.com |date=May 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508163128/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' op-ed piece "The Kids Aren’t All Right: Is over-education killing young artists?", published in 2005, curator [[Aaron Rose]] wrote about an observed trend he recognized in Los Angeles's most esteemed art schools and their MFA programs, including CalArts. He uses the example of Supersonic, "a large exhibition […] that features the work of MFA students from esteemed area programs like CalArts, Art Center, UCLA, etc." In his observation of the showcase he examined, "[...] the work left me mostly empty and with a few exceptions seemed like nothing more than a rehash of conceptual ideas that were mined years ago." He went on to state that "these institutions are staffed with amazing talents (Mike Kelley and John Baldessari among them). Legions of creative young people flock to our city [Los Angeles] every year to work alongside their heroes and develop their talents with hopes of making it as an artist." He goes on to further state "What happens too often in these situations, though, is that we find young artists simply emulating their instructors, rather than finding and honing their own aesthetics and points of view about the world, society, themselves. In the beginnings of an artist’s career, the power in his or her work should lie not in their technique or knowledge of art history or theory or business acumen, but in what one has to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Aaron|title=The Kids Aren’t All Right  |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-10-27/news/the-kids-aren-t-all-right/?showFullText=true |accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist Amanda Charchian was asked in an interview what she disliked about going to art school. In her response, she noted, "Most of my teachers came from the 1970′s CalArts conceptual art world, so they had us deconstruct everything we did in terms of the material being the message ([[Truth to materials]]). So if I used marble it had to be about social class, ancient sculpture, heaviness, etc. There was this idea that there’s nothing in the work that couldn’t relate to why you made it. Intuition was never enough of a reason."&lt;ref&gt;Kathan, Emma.

Today, CalArts is recognized alongside [[Black Mountain College]] and the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] as one of the truly successful experiments in American arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620044408/http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archivedate=June 20, 2006 |title="CalArts @ Moma", CalArts F/V website |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pixar University===
'''Pixar University''' is an in-house professional-development program within Pixar that expands the concept of employee education by broadening its focus from skills training to a more general fine-arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hempel|first=Jessi|title=Pixar University: Thinking Outside The Mouse|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pixar-University-Thinking-Outside-The-Mouse-2611923.php|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=SF Gate|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the educational model of CalArts. The program offers more than 110 courses: a complete film-making curriculum, classes on painting, drawing, sculpting and creative writing, which usually last four to sixteen weeks. These classes are available not only for animators, but everyone, from the security guard to cafeteria chef.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=William C. |title=How Pixar Adds a New School of Thought to Disney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/business/yourmoney/29pixar.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1579be4d45b9f9bb&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this setting, employees are allowed to miss work for a full slate in classes (about 14 per week) to raise the level of the best, cross-train, and develop mastery in whatever subjects may interest them. The vision behind the university is for employees to try new things, work together better and test new ideas, but one of the most important benefits from the program is to build morale, spirit and communication among employees. The dean of Pixar University, Randy S. Nelson, explains: "We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business. Instead of developing ideas, we develop people. Instead of investing in ideas, we invest in people. We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with lifelong learners. It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested. We want an organization filled with interested people.".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Title IX Complaint===
On August 29, 2014 a freshman student identified as Regina filed a Title IX complaint against CalArts, regarding CalArts' improper response to her reported rape by a classmate. According to [[Aljazeera]], the CalArts administration questioned the victim, "...ask[ing] her questions about her drinking habits, how often she partied, the length of her dress, how oral rape was even possible, whether she climaxed and whether climaxing was an issue when she'd been with her alleged rapist before."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was subjected to retaliation from friends of the perpetrator. The student filed a complaint against CalArts with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which was dismissed. The perpetrator was suspended for a year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Claire|title=CalArts to alleged rape victim: How long was your dress?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/10/14/calarts-sexual-assault.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Aljazeera America|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students walked out of their classes and protested in solidarity with the victim on October 23, later initiating a student-led meeting to discuss the issue of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Song|first=Jason|title=CalArts students protest school's handling of rape allegations |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calarts-protest-rape-20141023-story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahad|first=Shirley|title=CalArts students protest handling of rape cases |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/24/47627/calarts-students-protest-handling-of-rape-cases/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heddaya|first=Mostafa|title=After Walkout, CalArts Students Organize Against Administration |url=http://hyperallergic.com/158304/after-walkout-calarts-students-organize-against-administration/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small is committed to creating scholarly programming and research on contemporary anti-semitism at top tier universities internationally, and establishing contemporary antisemitism studies as a recognized academic discipline.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] from [[Oxford University]], and has taught at the [[University of London]], [[Ben Gurion University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Hebrew University]].

He also spoke as an expert on anti-Semitism at the Australian, British, Canadian, Chilean and Italian Parliaments, the German Bundestag, and at the United Nations, Geneva and in New York.

On September 19, 2006, Yale University founded The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism [http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/index.html], the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, housed at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, with Small as director and founder. He cited the increase in anti-Semitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study anti-Semitism] Associated Press, September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;''

In August 2010 in New Haven, Small was elected as the President of the newly formed International Association for the Study of Antisemitism (IASA).

Small was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. He was also an expert for the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. Charles Asher Small convened an historical conference at the Vatican in September 2017.  The ISGAP-Vatican Conference entitled "Antisemitism and Minority Rights in the Middle East: Regional and International Implications".   The international conference brought together scholars from around the world - Christian, Muslim, Copts, Bahai, Jewish, Catholic thinkers, as well as humans rights activists and policy makers including the British former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

==Study of Antisemitism==
Charles Asher Small and his colleagues at ISGAP have been at the forefront of ensuring that the scholars deal with issues of contemporary antisemitism at the academic level, around the world.

== Contributions ==
In a path-breaking article entitled "Anti-Israel Sentiment Predicts Anti-Semitism in Europe,"[http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/50/4/548.short] in The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Small and Yale's Prof. [[Edward Kaplan]] demonstrated that Europeans who hold deeply anti-Israeli views are  more likely to also have classic anti-Semitic opinions by a significant margin.  Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. "There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies," Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. "The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like," Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  "This is extraordinary. It's off the charts," says Small. "If a food or a drug was 56% more likely to cause cancer, it would be taken off the shelf."&lt;ref&gt;Yale expert: Not enough known about anti-Semitism, Aug. 8, 2007, Haviv Rettig Gur , ''The Jerusalem Post'' [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1186557401345&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter]&lt;/ref&gt;

CIAM promoted  [[modern architecture]] in the "Cubist style": the [[Bauhaus]], [[Weissenhof Estate|Weissenhof]], [[De Stijl]], and modern projects of the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. Parallel movements of the 1920s include [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalism]].]]

The '''Congrès internationaux d'architecture moderne''' (CIAM), or International Congresses of [[Modern Architecture]], was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the [[Modern architecture|Modern Movement]] focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==

The International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], Hélène de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and [[Sigfried Giedion]] (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th century [[manifesto]]s meant to advance the cause of "architecture as a social art".

Other founder members included [[Karl Moser]] (first president), [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Hendrik Berlage]], [[Victor Bourgeois]], [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], Max Ernst Haefeli, [[Hugo Häring]], Arnold Höchel, Huib Hoste, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (cousin of Le Corbusier), [[André Lurçat]], [[Ernst May]], [[Max Cetto]], Fernando García Mercadal, [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Werner M. Moser]], Carlo Enrico Rava, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, [[Mart Stam]], Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were to be [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Kolli]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Other later members included [[Minnette de Silva]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Uno Åhrén]], [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] (1929) and [[Fred Forbát]]. In 1941, [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]] was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in [[New York City]].

==Influence==

The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through [[urban planning]].

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier's competition entry for the [[Palace of the Soviets]], a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM's principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held onboard ship, the SS Patris II, which sailed from [[Marseille]] to [[Athens]].

Here the group discussed the principles of "The Functional City", which broadened CIAM's scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the "[[Athens Charter]]."

As CIAM members traveled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following [[World War II]], although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. [[Mart Stam]]'s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an "all-out attack on the city."

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group [[Team 10]] was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob B. Bakema]]).

{{Denmark culture}}
'''Danish Design''' is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and  production. Prominent examples are the [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]], the [[PH lamp]]s and the [[Sydney Opera House]] (Australia).

== Designers ==
Among the most successful designers associated with the concept are [[Børge Mogensen]] (1914–72), [[Finn Juhl]] (1912–89), [[Hans Wegner]] (1914–2007), [[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–71), [[Poul Kjærholm]] (1929–80), [[Poul Henningsen]] (1894–1967) and [[Verner Panton]] (1926–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=About Denmark |url=http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/?gclid=CNTh1cyYx5cCFQVMtAod-yYBRw |contribution=Danish Design and Architecture |publisher=Denmark |accessdate=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520092331/http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/?gclid=CNTh1cyYx5cCFQVMtAod-yYBRw |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designers of note include [[Kristian Solmer Vedel]] (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, [[Jens Harald Quistgaard]] (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements, [[Gertrud Vasegaard]] (1913–2007) for ceramics, and [[Ole Wanscher]] (1903–85), who had a classical approach to furniture design.

== History ==
{{See also|Danish modern}}
[[File:AJ 3101 ant.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Arne Jacobsen's Ant Chair, 1951]]
The [[Danish Culture Canon]] credits [[Thorvald Bindesbøll]] (1846–1908) with early contributions to design in the areas of [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[jewellery]], [[bookbinding]], [[silver]] and [[furniture]] although he is known in the rest of the world for creating the [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] logo (1904), still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/02_bindesboel.pdf | title = Thorvald Bindesbølls livsværk | publisher = Skoletjensten Kunstindustrimuseet | language = Danish | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 24 January 2013 | place = DK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canon also includes [[Knud V. Engelhardt]] (1882–1931) for a more industrial approach, especially in the rounded contours of his electric [[tram]]car designs which were widely copied.&lt;ref name=skoletj&gt;{{Citation | place = DK | url = http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/03_knud_v_engelhardt.pdf | title = Knud V. Engelhardts livsværk | format = PDF| publisher = Skoletjenesten Kunstindustrimuseet | language = Danish | accessdate = 22 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[textiles]], [[Marie Gudme Leth]] (1895–1997) brought the [[screen printing]] process to Denmark, opening a factory in 1935 which allowed her colourful patterns to be manufactured on an industrial basis.&lt;ref name =dbl&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Kunstner/Marie_Gudme_Leth | contribution = Marie Gudme Leth | title = Dansk Biografisk Leksikon | place = DK | language = Danish | publisher = Den store danske | accessdate = 23 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Sandgren]] introduced functionalism in the design of his masterful bookbindings. 
   
In the late 1940s, shortly after the end of the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.  After the end of the war, Europeans were keen to find novel approaches such as the light wood furniture from Denmark.  Last but not least, support in Denmark for freedom of individual expression assisted the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | format = PDF | title = Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs | place = DK | accessdate = 17 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established Furniture School at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]] played a considerable part in the development of furniture design. [[Kaare Klint]] taught [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] based on the size and proportions of objects, wielding considerable influence. [[Hans J. Wegner]], who had been trained as a cabinetmaker, contributed with a unique sense of form, especially in designing chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/ | contribution = Designers | title = Danish Furniture | accessdate = 17 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As head of the cooperative FDB furniture design studio, [[Børge Mogensen]] designed simple and robust objects of furniture for the average Danish family. [[Finn Juhl]] demonstrated an individualistic approach in designing chairs with an appealing but functional look.

In the early 1950s, American design also influenced Danish furniture. The American [[Charles Eames]] designed and manufactured chairs of moulded wood and steel pipes. These encouraged [[Arne Jacobsen]] to design his worldfamous [[Ant (chair)|Ant Chair]], Denmark's first industrially manufactured chair. Furthermore, as [[Shaker furniture]]—and especially its reputation for stripped down chairs—began to be more and more known abroad, it also influenced Danish designers.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Maggie, "Morphologies and Genealogies; Shaker Furniture and Danish Design," Design and Culture 7:3, 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poul Kjærholm]], [[Verner Panton]] and [[Nanna Ditzel]] followed a few years later, continuing the successful story of Danish design. Kjærholm worked mainly in steel and leather, Panton left Denmark during the 1960s to continue designing imaginative but highly unconventional [[plastic chairs]] while Nanna Ditzel, who also had a strongly individualistic approach, was successful in helping to renew Danish furniture design in the 1980s.

== Modern trends ==
[[File:Bernadotte Thermos.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Bernadotte's thermos jug, 2004]]
In the seventies Verner Panton made some of his most important designs. The Pantonova and the 1-2-3 System. They were a rave with the critics, but the consumers at the time found it too spacey. Today however it's true value to the design tradition is obvious. Danish furniture design failed to make any new important contributions in the 1980s. By contrast, industrial designers began to prosper, making use of the basic principles of focus on the user, respect for materials and attention to detail. For example, there are well known Danish designers, like Tobias Jacobsen (the grandson of [[Arne Jacobsen]]), who focused on the single elements of a violin when creating his chair "Vio" or on a boomerang when designing his eponymous sideboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fashionforhome.de/inspiration/designer/jacobsen | title = Designerprofile Tobias Jacobsen | publisher = Fashion For Home | access-date =2015-09-11| place = D}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Count Sigvard Bernadotte of Wisborg|Bernadotte]] &amp; Bjørn studio, established in 1950, was the first to specialise in industrial design, with an emphasis on office machines, domestic appliances and functional articles such as the thermos jug. The electronics manufacturer [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]], in collaboration with Bernadotte &amp; Bjørn and later with [[Jacob Jensen]] and [[David Lewis (designer)|David Lewis]], went on to excel in modern design work. Around the same time, the [[Stelton (company)|Stelton]] company collaborated with [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Erik Magnussen]] to produce their iconic vacuum jug, a huge international success.

Another successful design field is medical technology. Danish design companies like [[3PART]], [[Designit]] and [[Christian Bjørn Design|CBD]] have worked in this area with individual designers such as [[Steve McGugan]] and [[Anders Smith]].

In 2002 the Danish Government and the City of Copenhagen launched an effort to establish a world event for design in Copenhagen.  Originally understood as a tool for branding traditional Danish design, the non-profit organization ''INDEX:'' shifted focus after worldwide research and coined the concept of Design to Improve Life, which rapidly became celebrated in Denmark and around the world. The organization now hands out the biggest design award in the world biannual in Copenhagen, tours large scale outdoor exhibition around the world, run educational program as well as design labs and hosts a global network.{{Citation needed | date = February 2013}}

Today, there is strong focus on design in Denmark as industry increasingly appreciates the importance of design in the business environment. In addition, as part of its trade and industry policy, the [[Danish government]] has launched the [[DesignDenmark]] initiative which aims to restore Denmark to the [[international design]] elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ebst.dk/file/7260/designdenmark.pdf |title=DesignDenmark |publisher=The Danish Government |accessdate=17 December 2008 |place=DK |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530045252/http://www.ebst.dk/file/7260/designdenmark.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[Image:SydneyOperaHouse.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Utzon's Sydney Opera House, 1973]]
Modern [[Architecture of Denmark|architecture]] has also contributed to the concept of Danish design.

[[Arne Jacobsen]] was not just a furniture designer but one of the leading architects of his times. Among his achievements are the Bellevue Theater and restaurant, Klampenborg (1936), the [[Århus City Hall]] (with [[Erik Møller]]; 1939–42) and the [[Radisson SAS Royal Hotel, Copenhagen|SAS Royal Hotel]] (1958–60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/Architecture/WhoIsWhoInHistoricalDanishArchitecture/?wbc_purpose=basi |contribution=Who is Who in Historical Danish architecture |title=About |publisher=Denmark |place=DK |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520092105/http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/Architecture/WhoIsWhoInHistoricalDanishArchitecture/?wbc_purpose=basi |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jørn Utzon]] (1918–2008), Denmark's most widely recognized architect, is remembered for his expressionist [[Sydney Opera House]] (1966) and the later [[Bagsværd Church]] (1976) with its wavy concrete roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/copenhagen/bagsvaerd_kirke_utzon.htm |title=Bagsvaerd Kirke, København |website=e-architect |access-date=18 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henning Larsen]] (b. 1925) is the architect who designed the boldly modern [[Copenhagen Opera House]] on the island of [[Holmen naval base|Holmen]] which was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/copenhagen/copenhagen_opera_house.htm |title=Copenhagen Opera House |website=e-architect | access-date=18 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent achievements ==
Today, the concept of Danish design is thriving in an ever-wider number of fields. Among recent highlights are:
*  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York has chosen to outfit 95% of its new [[Yoshio Taniguchi]]-designed home with furniture by Danish design company [[GUBI]].
* The Danish [[Zenvo]] ST1 supercar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The phrase “Danish design” brings to mind odd-looking chairs and bright-colored handbags — not (this supercar).

'''David Sloan Wilson''' (born 1949) is an [[Americans|American]] [[evolutionary biologist]] and a Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at [[Binghamton University]]. He is a son of the author [[Sloan Wilson]] and co-founder of the [[Evolution Institute]].

==Academic career==

Wilson graduated with a B.A. with high honors in 1971 from the [[University of Rochester]]. He then completed his Ph.D. in 1975 at [[Michigan State University]]. He then worked as a Research Fellow in the Biological Laboratories at [[Harvard University]] from 1974-1975. He then held a dual position as a Research Associate in Zoology at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and the [[University of Washington]] from 1975 to 1976. After this he was a Senior Research Officer at the [[South Africa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n National Research Institute for the Mathematical Sciences from 1976 to 1977.

Wilson moved back to the United States and held an Assistant Professorship in the Division of Environmental Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]], from 1977 to 1980. He then served as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the [[Kellogg Biological Station]] and Department of Zoology of [[Michigan State University]] from 1980 to 1988. Wilson was then promoted to full Professor of Biological Sciences at the State University of New York, Binghamton, in 1988. He was then given a joint appointment as Professor of Anthropology in 2001.

Wilson started the Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program at Binghamton University to provide a program that unifies diverse disciplines under the theory of evolution. Students in the program take evolution-themed courses in a variety of disciplines including biology, anthropology, psychology, bioengineering, philosophy, [[evolutionary origin of religions|religion]] and the [[evolutionary psychology of religion|psychology of religion]]. There is also a required course called "Current Topics in Evolutionary Studies", where students attend weekly seminars with a discussion followed afterward. [[SUNY New Paltz]] has started a similar program.

==Research==

Wilson is a prominent proponent of the concept of [[group selection]] (also known as multi-level selection) in evolution. He and [[Elliott Sober]] proposed a framework called [[group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multilevel selection theory]], which incorporates the more orthodox approach of gene-level selection and individual selection, in their book ''Unto Others''. This framework argues that while genes serve as the means by which organisms' designs are transmitted across generations, individuals and groups are vehicles for those genes and both are arenas for genes to act on. Indeed, genes themselves can be affected by selection, not just because of their effects on the design of their vehicle (the organism) but also because of their effect on the functioning of the DNA on which they reside. Hence the notion of multilevel selection. Wilson has also coined the concept of a [[trait-group]], a group of organisms linked not permanently as a group but having a shared fate due to interactions that they have.

Wilson has described himself as an "enthusiastic proponent" of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebestschools.org/dialogues/evolution-david-sloan-wilson-interview/ "David Sloan Wilson Interview"]. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
* Unto Others (1998) co-edited with Elliott Sober. (Proposition of a framework called multilevel selection theory, which incorporates the more orthodox approach of gene-level selection and individual selection).
* [[Darwin's Cathedral]] (2002) (Religion as a multi-level adaptation).
* Rethinking the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology (2006) co-edited with E. O. Wilson
* Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives (2007)
* The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time (2011)
* Pathological Altruism (2011) co-edited with Barbara Oakley, Ariel Knafo, and Guruprasad Madhavan.
* Does Altruism Exist?: Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others (2015)
* The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative (2005) co-edited with Jonathan Gottschall

Wilson's book ''[[Darwin's Cathedral]]'' proposes that religion is a multi-level adaptation, a product of cultural evolution developed through a process of [[multi-level selection]] for more cooperative and cohesive groups. His book ''Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives'' attempts to give an introduction to evolution for a broad audience, detailing the various ways in which evolution can be applied to everyday affairs. There is also a class at Binghamton University that is called "Evolution for Everyone", and students are required to read the book as part of the class.

Wilson's latest book for a general audience is ''The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time'', published in August 2011. Wilson also co-edited ''Pathological Altruism'' published by [[Oxford University Press]] in November 2011 with Barbara Oakley, Ariel Knafo, and Guruprasad Madhavan.

Wilson and his co-author [[E.O. Wilson|E. O. Wilson]] have become well known{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} for the quote, "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups. Everything else is commentary". This quotation appeared in their paper, "Rethinking the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology".

Wilson is a blogger for the [[ScienceBlogs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolution/|title=David Sloan Wilson's blog at ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he extensively discusses and defends both the theory of evolution and his multilevel selection model.

The '''Department of Physics''' in Lund is a department that belongs to both the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Faculty of Engineering]] at [[Lund University]]. The main goals are to expand the understanding of physics, its applications and to share scientific progress to new generations. Research is conducted in most of the [[physics]] subdivisions. The department also offers courses and a [[Master's degree|Masters's degree programs]] in pure physics and provides physics education for the [[Master of Science in Engineering|Master of Science in Engineering programs]].

== History ==
In 1666 [[Lund University]] was founded without a faculty of science, so the physics research was conducted under the faculty of philosophy. In addition, during its first 150 years the University had no [[professor]]ship in pure physics, so the teachings was instead given by professors in [[mathematics]]. There were however a course in [[experimental physics]] from the early 18th century, but that course was given by a professor in theoretical medicine; [[Kilian Stobæus]] was appointed as the first professor in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=Ulf|publisher=Lunds universitetshistoriska sällskap|year=2015|isbn=9789175453200|location=Lund|pages=13–19|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the early 19th century that the physics professorship split from the mathematics, but then the professorship was shared with the [[astronomy]]. The University received its first full professor in physics in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=48|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a pure department of [[science]] was not established until the late 19th century, the seeds for the department was established in 1735 when the physics teaching received its own space in the building Kungshuset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=31–32|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching was held inside Kungshuset until the late 19th century, when the department moved to its own building which had instrumental halls, auditoriums, workshops and a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=61–62|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department moved again in 1950 to a large building complex named ''Fysicum'' due to increased space requirements, and its been where since then.

== Research ==
At the Department of Physics advanced research takes place divided in different divisions. The research areas are: [[Atomic Physics]], [[Combustion|Combustion Physics]], [[Mathematical Physics]], [[Nuclear Physics]], [[Particle Physics]], [[Solid State Physics]] and [[Synchrotron Radiation|Synchrotron Radiation Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/contact/ |title=Contact |work=Department of Physics |accessdate=5 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/research/research-divisions/ |title=Research divisions |work=Department of Physics |accessdate=5 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department also hosts the Lund Nano Lab (LNL), part of NanoLund (formerly known as the Nanometer Structure Consortium), an interdisciplinary research enivronment for nanoscience and its applications in electronics, the life sciences etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nano.lu.se/ |title=NanoLund |work=Lund University |accessdate=10 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research centers are ''Lund Laser Centre (LLC)'', ''Consortium for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)'' and ''Lund University Combustion Centre (LUCC)''.

The '''ecological footprint''' measures human demand on nature, i.e., the quantity of nature it takes to support people or an economy. It tracks this demand through an [[ecological accounting]] system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use for their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region or the world ([[biocapacity]], the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature). In short, it is a measure of [[Human impact on the environment|human impact on Earth's ecosystem]] and reveals the dependence of the human economy on [[natural capital]].

The ecological footprint is defined as the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from [[fossil fuel]] use, and space for buildings and roads.

Footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale. Both footprint and biocapacity change every year with number of people, per person consumption, efficiency of production, and productivity of ecosystems. At a global scale, footprint assessments show how big humanity's demand is compared to what planet [[Earth]] can renew. Since 2003, [[Global Footprint Network]] has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations (known as the National Footprint Accounts). Every year the calculations are updated with the newest data. The time series are recalculated with every update since UN statistics also change historical data sets. As shown in Lin et al (2018)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt; the time trends for countries and the world have stayed consistent despite data updates. Also, a recent study by the Swiss Ministry of Environment independently recalculated the Swiss trends and reproduced them within 1-4% for the time period that they studied (1996-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Footprints of Switzerland|last=|first=|publisher=Federal Office for the Environment|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global Footprint Network estimates that, as of 2014, humanity has been using [[natural capital]] 1.7 times as fast as Earth can renew it.&lt;ref name="Data Sources"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/|title=Data Sources|date=2017-04-17|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"&gt;Lin, D; Hanscom, L; Murthy, A; Galli, A; Evans, M; Neill, E; Mancini, MS; Martindill, J; Medouar, F-Z; Huang, S; Wackernagel, M.

Ecological footprint analysis is widely used around the Earth in support of [[sustainability]] assessments.&lt;ref name="London Ecological Footprint 2003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyndhurst|first1=Brook|title=London’s Ecological Footprint A review|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ecological_footprint.pdf|website=Mayor of London|publisher=Greater London Authority (commissioned by GLA Economics)|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables people to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s, [[goods and services]], organizations, [[industry sector]]s, neighborhoods, cities, regions and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Global Footprint Network [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/ "Ecological Footprint: Overview."] Retrieved on April 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. The latest version are the updated standards from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Global Footprint Network |title=Ecological Footprint Standards 2009 |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/ |website=Global Footprint Network |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footprint measurements and methodology==
[[File:Blue Marble Western Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|The [[natural resource]]s of [[Earth]] are [[non-renewable resource|finite]], and unsustainably strained by current levels of human activity.]] For 2014, Global Footprint Network estimated humanity's ecological footprint as 1.7 planet Earths. This means that, according to their calculations, humanity's demands were 1.7 times faster than what the planet's ecosystems renewed.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org|title=Open Data Platform|website=data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a community, a city, a town, a region, a nation, or humanity as a whole. Cities, due to their [[population density|population concentration]], have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8154513/Architecture_of_the_Anthropocene|work=academia.edu|title=Most poignantly... cities in the Anthropocene will remain the ‘ground zero'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the web page of Global Footprint Network &lt;ref name="Methodology and Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Methodology and Data |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=15 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in greater detail in academic papers, including Borucke et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borucke |first1=M |last2=Moore |first2=D |last3=Cranston |first3=G |last4=Gracey |first4=K |last5=Lazarus |first5=E |last6=Morales |first6=J.C. |last7=Wackernagel |first7=M. |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere’s regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |journal=Ecological Indicators |date=2013 |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf A Research Agenda for Improving National Ecological Footprint Accounts] Retrieved: 2007-11-11 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128200301/http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The first academic publication about ecological footprints was by [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=William E. |authorlink=William Rees (academic) |date=October 1992 |title=Ecological footprints and appropriated carrying capacity: what urban economics leaves out |journal=Environment and Urbanisation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–130 |doi=10.1177/095624789200400212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of [[Mathis Wackernagel]], under Rees' supervision at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990–1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=Ecological Footprint and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: A Tool for Planning Toward Sustainability |author=Wackernagel, M. |year=1994 |publisher=School of Community and Regional Planning.

"Land Use: Measuring a Community's Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator for Sustainability"; and "Using Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator, Measuring the Sustainability of a Community." Report I &amp; II to the UBC Task Force on Healthy and Sustainable Communities, Vancouver.&lt;/ref&gt; To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's "small footprint on the desk".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1229007727-rHeHNAWQ6qCKYwJ6WbOsVg William Safire, On Language]: Footprint, New York Times Magazine, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth'' with illustrations by Phil Testemale.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees" /&gt;

Footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon, Food, Housing, and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to [[life-cycle assessment|life-cycle analysis]] wherein the consumption of [[energy]], [[biomass]] ([[food]], [[fiber]]), [[building material]], [[water]] and other [[natural resource|resources]] are converted into a normalized measure of land area called [[global hectare]]s (gha).

Per capita ecological footprint (EF), or ecological footprint analysis (EFA), is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about [[carrying capacity]] and [[overconsumption]], with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 [[global hectare]]s (gha) per capita. The [[United States|U.S.]] footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of [[Switzerland]] was 5.6 gha, while [[China]]'s was 1.8 gha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/footprint_for_nations] or [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129104811/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding |date=2009-01-29 }} Living Planet Report 2008 outlines scenarios for humanity's future.

Retrieved: 2007-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees"&gt;Wackernagel, Mathis &amp; Rees, William (1996)"Our Ecological Footprint" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators (''see'' [[#External links|Footprint Calculator]], below).

== Global trends in humanity's ecological footprint ==
According to the 2018 edition of the National Footprint Accounts, humanity’s total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Humanity’s ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity’s total ecological footprint&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;.

The Earth’s biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Because of agricultural intensification, biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. 

Therefore, the Earth has been in ecological overshoot (where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can’t renew) since the 1970’s&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. In 2018, [[Earth Overshoot Day]], the date where humanity has used more from nature then the planet can renew in the entire year, was estimated to be August 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/earth-overshoot-day/|title=Earth Overshoot Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Now more than 85% of humanity live in countries that run an ecological deficit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|title=Ecological Footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This means their ecological footprint for consumption exceeds the biocapacity of that country. 

==Studies in the United Kingdom==
The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 [[global hectare]]s per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England).&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

Two recent studies{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} have examined relatively low-impact small communities. [[BedZED]], a 96-home [[mixed-income housing]] development in South [[London]], was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the [[Peabody Trust]]. Despite being populated by relatively "mainstream" home-buyers, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site London's first [[carsharing]] club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in 2002. [[Findhorn Ecovillage]], a rural [[intentional community]] in [[Moray]], [[Scotland]], had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of [[Cluny Hill]] College. However, the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php Findhorn eco-footprint is ‘world’s smallest’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123092120/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php |date=2009-01-23 }} ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', August 11, 2008.

Grazi et al. (2007) have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental [[externality|externalities]], agglomeration effects and trade advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Grazi |author2=J.C.J.M. van den Bergh |author3=P. Rietveld |title=Welfare economics versus ecological footprint: modeling agglomeration, externalities and trade |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=135–153 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10640-006-9067-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that the two methods can lead to very distinct, and even opposite, rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity. However this should not be surprising, since the two methods address different research questions.

[[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Newman]] (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Peter|date=October 2006|title=The environmental impact of cities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069599|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=275–295|doi=10.1177/0956247806069599|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as "parasitic". This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large ''[[hinterland]]s''. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of [[economies of scale]]. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for [[autarky]]. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade. &lt;!-- which it does not, I'll try to track down Wackernagel's piece on this, it's somewhere on my hard drive. belg4mit --&gt; Therefore, the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W. Richardson |publisher=Pam.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Something about per capita EF of a nation vs. fairshare should be mentioned here as a counterpoint. i.e; it can provide a frame of reference as to justness --&gt;

The method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural [[monoculture]]s by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if [[organic farming]] yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being "penalized" with a larger ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, M., C. Borgstrom Hansson and S. Bond (2006) [http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/documents/ISA&amp;WWF_Bioproductivity&amp;LandDisturbance.pdf On the bioproductivity and land-disturbance metrics of the Ecological Footprint]. University of Sydney, ISA Research Paper, June, 06, in collaboration with WWF. Retrieved: 2007-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for [[biodiversity]], the problem might be solved. Indeed, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s [[Living Planet Index|Living Planet Report]] complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loh, J., R.

[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|500px|right|The Vattenfall study found Nuclear, Hydro, and Wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]] the utility uses to produce electricity, namely: Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per kW⋅h of produced power. This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of any of their electricity sources.&lt;ref&gt;nuclearinfo.net.

{{Main|List of countries by ecological footprint}}

The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"/&gt; The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities.&lt;ref name="Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|website=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GHG footprint]] or the more narrow [[carbon footprint]] are a component of the ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of CO2 (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people or whole societies.&lt;ref name="Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benn|first1=Hilary|last2=Milliband|first2=Ed|title=Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69282/pb13309-ghg-guidance-0909011.pdf|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Ecological indicators''' are used to communicate information about [[ecosystem]]s and the impact human activity has on ecosystems to groups such as the public or [[government]] [[policy]] makers. Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by non-scientists to make management decisions. For example, the number of different [[beetle]] [[taxon|taxa]] found in a field can be used as an [[Diversity index|indicator]] of [[biodiversity]].{{ref|Gird}}{{ref|Niem}}{{ref|Osi}}

Many different types of indicators have been developed.  They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems, including biological, chemical and physical.  Due to this variety, the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process.{{ref|Kurt}}

Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive.{{ref|Bert}}{{ref|Osi}} For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every [[bird]], [[plant]] and [[animal]] in a newly [[Restoration ecology|restored]] [[wetland]] to see if the restoration was a success. Instead, a few [[indicator species]] can be monitored to determine the success of the restoration.

:''"It is difficult and often even impossible to characterize the functioning of a complex system, such as an eco-agrosystem, by means of direct measurements.  The size of the system, the complexity of the interactions involved, or the difficulty and cost of the measurements needed are often crippling"''{{ref|Gird}}

The terms ecological indicator and [[environmental indicator]] are often used interchangeably. However, ecological indicators are actually a sub-set of environmental indicators.  Generally, environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the [[Ecosystem|environment]], environmental conditions and societal responses.  Ecological indicators refer only to [[ecology|ecological]] processes; however, sustainability indicators are seen as increasingly important for managing humanity's coupled human-environmental systems&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R. R. (2018). A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations. Ecological Indicators, 89, 466-479. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.050&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policy evaluation==

Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment.

===Contributions===

Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by:{{ref|Pior}}
*Providing decision-makers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment.
*Helping decision-makers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policy-makers versus the environment.
*Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance [[ecological goods and services]].

Based on the [[United Nations]] [[convention to combat desertification]] and [[convention for biodiversity]], indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors.  For instance, for the CCD, the [[Unesco]]-funded [[Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel]] (OSS) has created the Réseau d'Observatoires du Sahara et du Sahel ([[ROSELT]]) (website [http://www.roselt-oss.teledection.fr]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) as a network of cross-Saharan observatories to establish ecological indicators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Limitations===

There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs.

For indicators to be useful for policy analysis, it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales (local, regional, national and international).  Currently, indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges:

# Variable availability of data and information on local, regional and national scales.
# Lack of methodological standards on an international scale.
# Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment.
# Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends.
# When compiled, local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result.{{ref|Pior}}

Indicators also face other limitations and challenges, such as:

# Lack of reference levels, therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak.
# Indicator measures can overlap, causing over estimation of single parameters.
# Long-term monitoring is necessary to identify long-term environmental changes.
# Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics, ethics or cultural values. {{ref|Pior}}

'''Ersilia Caetani-Lovatelli''' or '''Ersilia Caetani''' (12 October 1840 – 22 December 1925) was an [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] art historian, cultural historian and archaeologist.

==Life==
Caetani-Lovatelli was born in [[Rome]] in 1840 to [[Michelangelo Caetani]] and the Polish Countess Calixta Rzewuski. Her mother was from the important Rzewuski family and the aristocratic [[Caetani]] family had featured in the history of Rome and Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caetani Family|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Caetani-family|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learnt Greek, Latin and Sanskrit and in 1859 she married [[Giovanni Lovatelli]]. Lovatelli was the first woman  to become a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], which is the oldest Italian scientific academy.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Ersilia&amp;last=Lovatelli Ersilia Lovatelli], Grace Mary Crowfoot, Brown.edu, Retrieved 12 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was a widow she would open her salon at the [[Caetani Palace]] on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The salon attracted writers and composers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. Actually the salon operated from 1870 to 1915 and her husband died in 1879. Caetani-Lovatelli was interested in archaeology and history and published papers on several subjects. Caetani-Lovatelli joined several academic societies. Around 1915 was the end of the salons in Italy as society became embroiled in the first world war.&lt;ref name="MarronePuppa2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1660|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|pages=1660–1661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caetani-Lovatelli died in [[Rome]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

''Film à clef'' is the film equivalent of the literary ''[[roman à clef]]'', and the two share the same techniques.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

(Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/21/economic-blight-50-worst-american-cities-live/415609001/|title=These are America's worst cities for crime, employment, housing costs|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2017_AnnualReport_2017_FINAL.pdf|title=2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report|last=Kraus, L., Lauer, E., Coleman, R., and Houtenville, A.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Disability_statistics_-_health|title=Disability statistics - health - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harrington Research Centre''' is a government-run facility that is part of the AAFC umbrella of the agricultural sector. Located in [[Harrington, Prince Edward Island|Harrington, PEI]],  the centre has a vast wealth of resources all focused on the advancements of Canadian agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/research-centres/atlantic-provinces/charlottetown-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180557429228|title=Charlottetown Research and Development Centre|last=Canada|first=Crops and Livestock Research Centre - Charlottetown;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|website=www.agr.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potato research ==
PEI has long been an area of Canada that is known for growing quality island-grown potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peipotato.org/why-pei-potatoes|title=Why PEI Potatoes?|newspaper=PEI Potatoes|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the potato industry investing in methods in which potatoes can grow better, and without disease. One disease in particular that was hampered the PEI potato producers in the past decade is the [[Click beetle|wire-worm]]. This spurred scientist Dr. Noronha to create a wireworm trap which severely deterred the pest from affecting nearby potato crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-wireworm-pest-problem-trap-invention-1.3487351|title=New wireworm trap for $6M P.E.I. pest problem ''could be a major breakthrough'|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">'''Hip hop studies''' is a multidisciplinary field of study that encompasses sociology, anthropology, communication and rhetoric studies, religious studies, [[cultural studies]], [[critical race theory]], [[Missiology|missiological studies]], [[art history]], [[dance]], [[musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[music theory]], and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Monica|last2=Hodge|first2=Daniel White|last3=Coleman|first3=Jeffery|last4=Chaney|first4=Cassandra|title=The Hip in Hip Hop: Toward a Discipline of Hip Hop Studies|journal=Journal of Hip Hop Studies|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://savethekidsgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JHHS-Volume-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hip hop studies" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415969192|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''That's the Joint!'' includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of  "one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s."&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt; The publication of the first edition of ''That's the Joint!'' marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt;

[[Hip hop culture]], rooted in the 1970s post-industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: [[rap music]] (oral), [[turntablism]] or "[[DJing]]" (aural), [[B-boying|breaking]] (physical), [[graffiti]] art (visual), and knowledge (mental).&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=S.

From spoken-word artists to academic scholars hip-hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip-hop intelligentsia."&lt;ref name="hip-hop intelligentsia" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hip hop studies is part of the larger [[Hip hop|hip hop movement]].&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] mechanism within hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ForemanInterview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title='That's The Joint': A Scholarly Study of Hip-Hop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4458410|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=NPR|date=19 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
{{Quote|text=The methodologies of examining hip hop are borrowed from sociology, politics, religion, economics, urban studies, journalism, communications theory, American studies, transatlantic studies, black studies, history, musicology, comparative literature, English, linguistics, and other disciplines.|sign=[[Michael Eric Dyson]]|source=''[https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076 Know What I Mean?: Reflections on Hip-Hop]''(2007)}}

Hip hop studies' [[methodologies]], or methods of systematic inquiry and analysis, are drawn from a range of academic disciplines including anthropology, sociology, political science, history, linguistics, economics, performance studies, media and communicative studies, American studies, musicology, English and literature, women's and gender studies, and black studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Michael Eric|title=Know What I Mean? Reflections on Hip Hop|date=2010|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Dimitriadis, formerly a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Buffalo, was an academic who critically examined, amongst other topics, hip hop methodologies; writing "Questions of method are, at heart, questions about how one can best understand the world."&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimitriadis|first1=Greg|title=Framing Hip Hop: New Methodologies for New Times|journal=Urban Education|date=2015|volume=50|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.1177/0042085914563185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hip hop studies, this "world" encompasses the complexities of political, social, and economic exploitation of marginalized peoples, and hip hop practitioners'  resultant forms of resistant expression,&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; thus the frames of analysis used by scholars are equally complex and consider factors such as race, class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, location, and performance and performativity.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt; The use of [[ethnography]] is popular and preferred in hip hop studies because it is a mode of inquiry that enables a scholar to include a multiplicity of voices, and showcases the experiential knowledges of hip hop doers and consumers; ideally this method highlights the dual authority of practitioners' and academics' knowledges.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt;

== Foundational texts ==
Hip Hop studies has been growing as an academic discipline since the mid-1990s; two decades after its genesis. By the millennium and in the early 2000s, scholars such as [[Tricia Rose]], [[Michael Eric Dyson]], [[Cornel West]], [[Anthony B. Pinn]], [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], [[Nelson George]], Bakari Kitwana, [[Mark Anthony Neal]], and Murray Forman, began engage Hip Hop's history, messages of resistance, social cognizance, personal awareness, political activism, pleasure and power, and community engagement in scholarly works that gave Hip Hop academic legitimacy.&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt;  Works by these authors are considered foundational texts in the field of Hip Hop studies because their research and publication served to legitimate Hip Hop as serious academic endeavor and since 2002 scholarly inquiry centralizing Hip Hop culture has multiple exponentially; exemplified by the inception of the [http://hiphoparchive.org Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute at Harvard] in 2002,&lt;ref name=HHArchive@Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=DJ Bobby|title=Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute|url=http://hiphoparchive.org|website=Hip Hop Archive|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of the second edition of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=TTJ2011&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America '' (1994) ===
Discussions of scholarly writing on hip hop in the academia often begin with Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America'', published in 1994. This book is categorized within hip hop studies as being among the most important early full-length texts on rap and hip hop culture, which helped to establish hip hop studies as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldu|first1=Gail Hilson|title=The Kaleidoscope of Writing on Hip-Hop Culture|journal=Notes|date=1 September 2010|volume=67|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1353/not.2010.0031}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's book gives a comprehensive account of the evolutionary history of hip hop culture. In Rose's words, ''Black Noise'' "examines the complex and contradictory relationships between forces of racial and sexual domination, black cultural priorities, and popular resistance in contemporary rap music,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Introduction|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it outlines the social context of rap's existence. To achieve this analysis, Rose's includes a range of voices and perspectives by using an ethnographic approach; conducting interviews with hip hop performers and practitioners, as well as hip hop listeners and consumers.&lt;ref name=Rose1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's interviews were conducted throughout the United States, as well as in Hong Kong, China, and Japan.&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; Rose's groundbreaking work continues to be referenced as a foundational text by contemporary scholars because its detailed documentation of hip hop culture's revolution employs [[ethnography]], cultural theory, urban history and historiography, as well as [[Black feminism|black feminist thought]]; culminating in an extensive bibliography.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;

=== Jeff Chang's ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'' (2005) ===
Jeff Chang's comprehensive examination of hip hop, ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'', received the American Book Award after its publication in 2005 and is often cited by hip hop cultural critics, hip hop journalists, popular-culture scholars, and hip hop academics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang situates hip hop as "forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica,"&lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1|page=Rear Cover Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that "hip-hop has been a generation-defining global movement," &lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK /&gt; shaped by the deindustrialization and globalization of the post-civil rights era.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's method of inquiry and analysis hybrids statistical, historical, and ehtnographical data with a casual writing style that includes Chang's opinions, sections of extended dialogue, and interviews.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's central themes in this text are race, and the intersections of race in hip hop agendas/politics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt;

== College/university programs and degrees ==

[[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]], was the first to offer a Hip Hop-specific class to students in 1991.&lt;ref name="ACADEMICYES2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/ACADEMIC-HIP-HOP-YES-YES-Y-ALL-2613595.php|title=ACADEMIC HIP-HOP? YES, YES Y'ALL.|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyham|date=2007|website=SF Gate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceeding two decades, colleges across the United States have begun to offer a variety of courses specifically about Hip Hop culture; these include top-ranked universities, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[New York University|NYU]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Additionally, in 2012, the [[University of Arizona]] announced the implementation of a Hip Hop studies minor; the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Bonnie|title=Announcing a New Minor in Africana Studies with Concentration in Hip-Hop Cultures at the U of A!|url=http://africana.arizona.edu/news-events/announcing-new-minor-africana-studies-concentration-hip-hop-cultures-u|website=The University of Arizona: College of Humanities Africana Studies|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the University of Arizona's minor is the first interdisciplinary Hip Hop studies concentration of its kind, since 2009 at [[McNally Smith College of Music]] in St. Paul, Minnesota students can acquire a diploma in Hip Hop studies that focuses on Hip Hop music technique, music and audio production, and music industry economics and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diploma: Hip-Hop Studies|url=http://www.mcnallysmith.edu/diplomas/hip-hop-studies|website=McNally Smith College of Music|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 [[Tiffin University]] in Ohio began offering a music performance degree for students with primary focus in emceeing and beatmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polarentllc.com/producer-j-rawls-joins-tiffin-university-team/|title=Producer J Rawls Joins Tiffin University Team  Polar Ent LLC|website=polarentllc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffin.edu/promusic|title=Professional Music|last=University|first=Tiffin|website=Tiffin University|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from classes and degree programs, development in the field has also been marked by the proliferation of conferences (domestically and internationally), symposiums, the development of readers and anthological texts, the establishment of the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard—each characteristic of a growing interest in and engagement with Hip Hop culture in academic discourse. In 2017, the top three universities to study Hip Hop at were [[McNally Smith College of Music]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campustales.com/281/top-3-universities-to-study-hip-hop-music|title=Top 3 Universities to Study Hip Hop Music|work=CampusTales|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques and critics ==

Hip Hop studies has not grown without critics, both within and outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and community activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics who may or may not have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all.&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; In an article published by the ''San Francisco Globe'' in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: "You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia in a lot of places has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension."&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; 
Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self-self-proccalimed "hip hop head."&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;
Other critics, such as [[Alex Beam]] a columnist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the "celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women,"&lt;ref name=alexbeam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Alex|title=Meet the rap-ademics|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/12/14/the_ivy_league_offers_its_esteemed_interpretation_of_hip_hop_lyrics/?p1=Features_link11|accessdate=5 March 2015|agency=Boston Globe|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mainstream rap and Hip Hop.&lt;ref name=alexbeam /&gt;

Despite the critiques previously mentioned, not all critics of Hip Hop studies are trying to point out the perceived flaws as ways to invalidate its place in academia. Hip Hop feminists and feminism offer critics of Hip Hop studies from a perspective which adds another facet to Hip Hop studies, one that not only involves but gives a platform and amplifies the voice of Black and Latinx women and the LGBTQ+ community as they face the most erasure in the world of Hip Hop studies, even though they were there from the very start. Published books such as ''Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123957643|title=Home girls make some noise : hip-hop feminism anthology|date=2007|publisher=Parker Publishing, LLC|others=Pough, Gwendolyn D., 1970-, Neal, Mark Anthony., Morgan, Joan.|isbn=1600430104|edition=First|location=Mira Loma, Calif.|oclc=123957643}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', is'' an anthology that features journals, poetry, and articles by both women of color and LGBTQ+ community which depict where Hip Hop began and the direction in which it very well may go.

===Hungarian Space Camp ===
====History====
The camp was founded by Aunt Magdi, the "Space Granny" in 1994. Her intent was to introduce space research and astronautics to the youth. That time the program of the camp consisted mostly of lectures presented by the best-known Hungarian scientists in the field. Later the camp had a younger leadership, leading to a shift to more active and creative programs. From 2010 the duration of the camp is one week, from Sunday to Saturday. 
The participants are students between the age of 13 and 18, all interested in sciences and space topics. About quarter of the students return next year and every fifth student becomes a regular camper. Some acknowledged space researchers started their "space career" in the Space Camp, like the present (2017) Secretary General and several Members of Board.

Topics cover a wide range, from the basics of astronomy through problems of space debris to deciding the dilemma if Pluto is a planet or not. Other '''activities''' include several practical exercises make the camp exciting, e.g. water rocketry, underwater assembly, creating stereo pictures, astronomical observation, excursions, bathing, etc.  There is a main topic every year which meets the topic of the Student Competition.

====Mentor Program====
Since 2015 private individuals and companies are invited to co-finance the ''Hungarian Space Camp'' as '''Mentors'''. HAS welcomes financial support of participation of needy students from Hungary and from the Hungarian diaspora in the surrounding countries. In the past years about one fifth of the participants was able to join the Camp by favor of a Mentor.

===Student competition===
HAS yearly announces a '''Student Competition''' for primary and secondary school students, since 1992. The topics announced around October are always different, but focus on a current aspect of space research and exploration. The topic of the Student Competition is going to be the main topic of the Space Camp of that year. E.g. title of the Competition was "Civilians in Space" in 2014, "Beyond Mars" in 2015 and "Cleaning in Space" in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
Categories: writing essay; drawing; preparing project plan; creating video, website, Facebook page or blog. &lt;br /&gt;
Small teams of two or three students are also welcome. Applications are evaluated in two age classes: age between 11-14 and 15-18. The competition is open for visually impaired students as well. Their works are evaluated separately.&lt;br /&gt;
Prizes include participation in the Space Camp for free or for a reduced fee; science books and magazines; a visit to a selected space research institute or company; free one-year membership in the society.

===Space Academy ===
''Hungarian Astronautical Society'' in collaboration with the international ''[[Space Generation Advisory Council]]'' initiated a yearly event called '''Space Academy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://urakademia.hu Space Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 for university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. .&lt;ref&gt;http://spacegeneration.org/sgac-regions/europe/hungary.html  SGAC Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a four-day workshop in August where the participants outline a solution for a given task or problem together. 
* 2015: Voice of Youth - Which Way Now in the European Space Agency?
* 2016: Design Experiment to the International Space Station!

===Space Academy Club===
'''Space Academy Club''' is a lecture series organized by the '''Hungarian Astronautical Society''' and the Hungarian organizers of '''Space Generation Advisory Council'''. It takes place usually in February, April, September and November, during university semesters. It targets primarily university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. The series is connected with Space Academy in their name and their target groups.

===Hungarian Space Studies Annuary (alias Space Brochure, Hun: Űrtan évkönyv)===
HAS has been publishing its Astronautical Brochure since 1961, presenting the recent activities of HAS and summarizing the globally most significant affairs of space research. Hungarian researchers working in space research and its interdisciplinary fields present their latest results.

===Space Research Day===
Space Research Day is organized yearly. It joins the International Space Week in October. It usually takes place at one of the universities of Budapest. The program consists of lectures on actual space activities and space related results and exchange of views. There are blocks for professionals, interested amateurs and students.

===Hungarian Space Research Forum (Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physics Seminar) ===
'''Hungarian Space Research Forum''' is a traditional biennial conference of researchers of the field, to be held for the 30th time in 2017. Its former title and now subtitle '''Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physical Seminar''' expresses its original specialty which gained a broader horizon in the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/scostep/scostep_eng.html  Hungarian National Committee of SCOSTEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/ionmagnszem/ionmagnszem.html  List of Ionospheric-Magnetopheric Seminars from 1972-2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Hungarian physicists, geophysicists, astronomers, meteorologists etc. take part in this seminar by presenting their latest researches through lectures and posters.

[[File:NUS_IMS_Main_building_for_the_Institute_for_Mathematical_Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Main building for the Institute for Mathematical Sciences]]
The '''Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS)''' is a research institute for mathematics and its applications at the [[National University of Singapore]].  It occupies two buildings at the hilly Prince George’s Park of the university campus.

== History ==

The IMS was established in 2000 funded by the [[Singapore Ministry of Education]] for the first five years of operation. Its birth was the culmination of the efforts of many individuals with the shared vision of a mathematical institute in Singapore facilitating and supporting research in the mathematical sciences at the highest level. Soon after its opening, the IMS assumed an international profile, hosting visitors from many parts of the world. Today it organizes programs and workshops attended by more than 700 mathematical scientists each year and is a major node in the mathematical research community in the Asia-Pacific region. 

== Scientific programs ==

There are typically six programs and twenty workshops organized in a year, with up to 60 participants for each of them. A program lasts between one and three months, while workshops are of one week duration. IMS also holds graduate level summer/winter schools for and outreach programs such as public lectures and math camps. Programs and workshops are selected two years in advance by the IMS Scientific Advisory Board. They cover the entire range of mathematics and its applications.

The '''Irish Music Hall of Fame''' was a multimedia exhibition in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which opened in September 1999.  It recognised what it described as the best of Irish musical talent of all types over the decades. 

==Overview==
Musician and singer [[Van Morrison]] was the first person to be inducted into the museum. The museum was a memorabilia-filled display telling the story of Irish music through exclusive and personally donated merchandise from many important Irish musical artists including [[Van Morrison]], [[U2]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[The Undertones]] and [[Boyzone]].

The museum has since closed and is currently looking for a new location with an undetermined reopening date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u2tour.de/travelguide/guides/en/Hot_Press_Irish_Music_Hall_Of_Fame_closed.html Infos at U2.tour.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keeping All Students Safe Act''' refers to a pair of  [[American (USA)|American]] legislative proposals introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 6, 2011 as  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381: H.R. 1381] and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]  on December 16, 2011 as [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020].  The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school.  The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.&lt;ref name="HR4247"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4247: HR4247] Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act, H.R. 4247, U.S. House of Representatives, Dec. 9, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), Ranking Member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]], and Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS).

==Background &amp; Legislative History==
Restraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely.  Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.&lt;ref name="S2020"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 2, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects.&lt;ref name="GAO1"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122526.pdf  U.S. GAO Report] United States Government Accountability Office, “Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers,” May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found "hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-oks-bill-limiting-teachers-in-restraint-seclusion-of-students-q93u2gl-137984118.html Journal Sentinel], “Senate OKs Bill Limiting Teachers In Restraint, Seclusion Of Students,” Journal Sentinel, Jan. 24, 2012.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the incidents involved children with [[disabilities]] who are enrolled in [[special education]], the GAO reported.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;

The GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint.  The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room.  Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time.  His parents were never informed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/death-highlights-lack-of-100352.html Atlanta Journal Constitution], Alan Judd, “Death Highlights Lack of Regulation at Psycho-educational Schools,” Atlanta Journal Constitution, July 27, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found that a New York child was placed alone in a seclusion room 75 times in 6 months for whistling and slouching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20090519/1arestraints19.art.htm USA Today], Greg Toppo, "Disabled Kids Restrained, Confined," USA Today, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Disability Rights Network and the Council of Parents Attorneys and Advocates also documented the nationwide use of restraint and seclusion in 2009.&lt;ref name="USN1"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2009/07/07/students-suffer-abusive-restraint-gao-says U.S. News &amp; World Report] Jessica Calefati, “Students Suffer Abusive Restraint, GAO Says,” U.S. News &amp; World Report, July 7, 2009.

Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee held hearings about the use of restraint and seclusion, chaired by Congressman George Miller.&lt;ref name="hearing1"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg49597/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg49597.pdf  U.S. House of Representatives Hearings]  U.S. Congress, Hearing Before the House Committee on Education and Labor, Examining the Abusive and Deadly Use of Seclusion and Restraint in Schools, 111th Congress, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

One witness testified that her 14-year-old son was killed when restrained by his 230-pound teacher, who smothered him by lying on top of him in a restraint during a disagreement about lunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-19/politics/schools.abuse_1_teacher-testimony-toni-price?_s=PM:POLITICS  CNN Restraints] Congress Hears Accounts Of Abused Special-Needs Students, CNN, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Another witness testified that her 7-year-old daughter was bruised when she was restrained face down for playing with her tooth, but the parent was never informed by the school.  She also testified that her child was later restrained again, and received a severe abrasion, but she was not informed of the restraint.  She testified that other children were denied access to food, water, and the bathroom while isolated in seclusion confinement rooms.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;  The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.  Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104277070 National Public Radio] Joseph Shapiro, “Report: Discipline Methods Endanger Disabled Kids,” National Public Radio, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  An Illinois State Board of Education representative presented data from Illinois showing that implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports reduced the use of restraint and seclusion significantly.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group.  The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt417/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt417.pdf  House Report 111-417], U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education &amp; Labor, House Report 111-417, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools, Feb. 23, 2010.

Because there is no federal law, state restraint and seclusion laws control.&lt;ref name="CNNState"&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-18/politics/siu.schools.abuse_1_special-needs-students-teacher-gao?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN Report] Abbie Boudreau &amp; Steve Turnham, “GAO report: Special-Needs Kids Abused In Schools,” CNN, May 18, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 report by Jessica Butler for the Autism National Committee summarized state seclusion and restraint laws and policies.  It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.  There are 27 states that have no requirement to notify parents when a child is restrained or secluded and only 12 states that require same day or next day notification.&lt;ref name="HowSafe"&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/HowSafeSchoolhouse.pdf  How Safe Is the Schoolhouse?] Jessica Butler, “How Safe Is The Schoolhouse?

As there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  The GAO found that only five states kept records.  In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08.  Many of the children had cognitive disabilities, autism, mental health disabilities, attention deficit disorder and other disabilities.&lt;ref name="NPR2" /&gt;  Professor Reece Peterson testified at the House Education and Labor hearing about the need for federal law requiring data collection nationwide.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

On December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller.  It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/12/09/restraint-bill-introduced/6448/ Disability Scoop], Michelle Diament, “Lawmakers Unveil Restraint And Seclusion Bill,” Disability Scoop, December 9, 2009.

Restraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011.  On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS).&lt;ref name="HR1381"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381], H.R. 1381, Keeping All Students Safe Act, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 16, 2011, the second anniversary of Congressman Miller’s first bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced a slightly different version of the Keeping All Students Safe Act, S. 2020.&lt;ref name="S2020" /&gt;

==Description of the Keeping All Students Safe Act==
This section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011.  The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.

The House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation.  The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation.  Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning.  
 
The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation.  The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe.  The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020 sec 4] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 4, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381 sec 5], Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 5, H.R. 1381, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture.  Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

Both bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;   There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;

Both bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners.  Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students.  The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

The Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;   Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-1649-filed.pdf  Federal Register], Medicaid Program; Use of Restraint and Seclusion in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Providing Psychiatric Services to Individuals Under Age 21; Interim Final Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. 7148, Jan. 22, 2001.  Retrieved March 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Congressman Miller on Introduction==

When Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-07/pdf/CREC-2011-04-07-pt1-PgH2413-7.pdf#page=1  Congressional Record House], Congressman George Miller, Congressional Record, April 6, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on Introduction==
Senator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so.  He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices.  . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that.  . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-16/pdf/CREC-2011-12-16-pt1-PgS8735.pdf  Congressional Record Senate], Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, Dec. 16, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin" /&gt;

==Related Events==
In March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection.  It reported that students with disabilities made up  represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school.  For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint.  CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use.  African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint.  Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf  CRDC Data Collection] Dept. of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, Revealing New Truths About Our Nation’s Schools, March 2012.

Cover of ''On Kitsch'' by Odd Nerdrum and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch" /&gt;|alt=Image shows man on a spherical object hunched over.]]
'''Kitsch painting''' is an international movement of [[Classical tradition|classical painters]] founded upon a 24 September 1998 speech and philosophy by the Norwegian artist, [[Odd Nerdrum]],&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Pettinger [http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-kitsch-campaign/Content?oid=926148] "The Kitsch Campaign" [Boise Weekly], December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; later clarified in his book ''[[On Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dag Solhjell and Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Kitsch-Jan-Erik-Ebbestad-Hansen/dp/8248901238] "On Kitsch" Kagge Publishing, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jan-Ove Tuv and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch"&gt;Odd Nerdrum, Sindre Mekjan, Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, Jan-Ove Tuv, and Dag Solhjell&lt;/ref&gt; The movement incorporates the techniques of the [[Old Masters]] with narrative, [[romanticism]], and emotionally charged imagery. The movement defines [[Kitsch]] as synonymous with the [[art]]s of ancient Rome or the [[techne]] of ancient Greece. Kitsch painters embrace kitsch as a positive term not in opposition to "[[art]]", but as its own independent superstructure. Kitsch painters assert that Kitsch is not an art movement, but a philosophical movement separate from [[art]]. The Kitsch movement has been considered an indirect criticism of the contemporary art world, but according to Nerdrum and many Kitsch painters, this is not their expressed intention.&lt;ref&gt;Signy Norendal, "Interview with Robert Dale Williams" [Aktuell Kunst] September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scott [http://artbabel.blogspot.com/2010/04/philosophy-of-kitsch-kant-kunst-and.html] The Philosophy of Kitsch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://janovetuv.com/bruker/articles/Defence%20of%20kich_E%2038-39.pdf Jan-Ove Tuv]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of kitsch painting philosophy==
The philosophy originated by Nerdrum first manifested into a group among Nerdrum's circle of students&lt;ref&gt;Kristiane Larssen "Skolemesteren" [D2/DagensNaeringsliv] November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Ove Tuv, Helene Knoop, Hege Elizabeth Haugen, Monika Helgesen, [[Jeremy Caniglia]], Kjetil Jul, Brad Silverstein, Carlos Madrid, Stefan Boulter, Brandon Kralik, Nanne Nyander, and soon expanded. Many kitsch painters were featured in and contributed essays to Nerdrum's book ''Kitsch: More than Art''&lt;ref&gt;Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Odd-Nerdrum-Kitsch-More-than/dp/8251636388] Schibsted Forlag, September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning sciences''' ('''LS''') is an interdisciplinary field that works to further scientific understanding of [[learning]] as well as to engage in the design and implementation of learning innovations, and the improvement of instructional methodologies. Research in the learning science traditionally focuses on cognitive-psychological, social-psychological, and cultural-psychological foundations of human [[learning]], as well as on the design of learning environments. Major contributing fields include [[cognitive science]], [[computer science]], [[educational psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[applied linguistics]].  Over the past decade, researchers have also expanded their focus to the design of curricula, [[informal learning]] environments, instructional methods, and policy innovations.

== Domain definition ==
As an emerging discipline, the learning sciences are still in the process of defining itself.  Accordingly, the identity of the field is multifaceted, and varies from institution to institution.  However, the International Society of Learning Sciences (ISLS, [http://www.isls.org/]) summarizes the field as follows:  "Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of learning sciences, born during the 1990s, study learning as it happens in real-world situations and how to better facilitate learning in designed environments – in school, online, in the workplace, at home, and in informal environments. Learning sciences research may be guided by constructivist, social-constructivist, socio-cognitive, and socio-cultural theories of learning." ISLS has a large worldwide membership, is affiliated with two international journals: ''[[The Journal of the Learning Sciences|Journal of the Learning Sciences]]'', and ''[http://ijcscl.org International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning]'', and sponsors the biennial Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference and International Conference of the Learning Sciences on alternate years.

Although controlled experimental studies and rigorous qualitative research have long been employed in learning science, LS researchers often use [[design-based research]] methods.  Interventions are conceptualized and then implemented in natural settings in order to test the [[ecological validity]] of dominant theory and to develop new theories and frameworks for conceptualizing learning, instruction, design processes, and educational reform. LS research strives to generate principles of practice beyond the particular features of an educational innovation in order to solve real educational problems, giving LS its interventionist character.

== History ==

Several significant events have contributed to the international development of learning science. Perhaps the earliest history can be traced back to the [[cognitive revolution]].

In the United States, an important effort to create a graduate program in learning science took place in 1983 when [https://sites.google.com/site/janhawkinsaward/home Jan Hawkins] and [[Roy Pea]] proposed a joint program between Bank Street College and the [http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/ New School for Social Research].  Called "Psychology, Education, and Technology" (PET), the program had a planning grant supported by the Sloan Foundation. In the end the program would have required new faculty, though, and the institutions involved never established such a program. [[Roger Schank]]'s arrival at Northwestern University in 1988 helped start the Institute for Learning Sciences.  In 1991, Northwestern initiated the first learning science doctoral program, designed by and launched by [[Roy Pea]] as its first director.  The program began accepting students in 1992, and after Pea became dean the program directorship was taken over by Brian Reiser. Since that time, a number of other high quality graduate programs in learning science began to appear around the world, and the field is continuing to be recognized as an innovative and influential area for education research and design.

''[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/authors/hlnsauth.asp The Journal of the Learning Sciences]'' was first published in 1991, with [[Janet Kolodner]] as founding editor.  Yasmin Kafai and Cindy Hmelo-Silver took over as editors in 2009, and then Iris Tabak and Joshua Radinsky took over as editors in 2013. ''[http://ijcscl.org/ The International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]'' was established as a separate journal in 2006, edited by Gerry Stahl and Freiderich Hesse. These journals, while relatively new in the field of education research, rapidly escalated and continue to place in upper ranks of the Educational Research section of the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] impact factor rankings.

The Institute for the Learning Sciences hosted the first International Conference for the Learning Sciences (ICLS) in August 1991 at Northwestern University (edited by Lawrence Birnbaum, and published by the AACE but no longer available). The first biennial meeting of the ICLS also took place at Northwestern University, in 1994.  [http://www.isls.org The International Society of the Learning Sciences] was established in 2002.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

By integrating multiple fields, learning science extends beyond other closely related fields in distinguishable  ways.  For example, learning science extends beyond [[psychology]], in that it also accounts for, as well as contributes to [[Computing|computational]], [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] approaches to the study of learning.  Similarly, learning science draws inspiration from [[cognitive science]], and is regarded as a branch of cognitive science; however, it gives particular attention to improving [[education]] through the study, modification, and creation of new technologies and learning environments, and various interacting and [[Emergence|emergent]] factors that potentially influence the [[learning]] of humans.

Many learning science researchers employ [[design-based research]] [[methodology]].  The growing acceptance of [[design-based research]] [[methodology]] as a means for study is often viewed as a significant factor distinguishing learning science from many of the fields that contribute to it. By including [[design-based research]] within its [[methodological]] toolkit, learning science qualifies as a "design science", with characteristics in common with other design sciences that employ [[Design Science (methodology)|design science]] such as [[engineering]] and [[computer science]].   Learning science is also considered by some as having some degree of overlap with [[instructional design]], although historically the two communities have come about in different ways and at times emphasized different programs of research, as described in a special issue of the journal ''Educational Technology'' in 2004.

However, it should be emphasized that [[design-based research]] is by no means the only [[research methodology]] used in the field.  Many other methodologies—including computational modeling, experimental and quasi-experimental research, and non-interventionist [[ethnographic]]-style qualitative research [[methodologies]]—have long been and continue to be employed in learning science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">The '''Library of Latin Texts''' (LLT) is a subscription-based database of Latin texts, from Antiquity up to the present day. First started in 1991 as the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT), it continues to be developed by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' and is hosted by [[Brepols Publishers]].

== History ==
In 1991, development of the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a [[CD-ROM]], was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. [[Paul Tombeur]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur.

When in 2002, the decision was made to expand the database's chronological scope beyond Medieval and Patristic times, its name was changed to ''Library of Latin Texts''. A further development followed in 2009. Then, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.&lt;ref name="Brepolis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brepolis.net/pdf/Brepolis_LLT_EN.pdf|title=Library of Latin Texts|publisher=BREPOL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between the LLT and similar databases ==
Unlike similar initiatives, like [[Corpus Corporum]] or [[The Latin Library]], the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have "been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice".&lt;ref name="Brepolis" /&gt;

The '''Manufacturing Engineering Centre''' ('''MEC''') is an international R&amp;D Centre of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing and Information Technology.  The MEC was founded in 1996 under the directorship of Professor Duc Truong Pham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = Professor Duc Truong Pham | url = http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/mechanical-engineering/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=22591&amp;Name=professor-duc-truong-pham | publisher = University of Birmingham | date = | accessdate = 5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre forms part of [[Cardiff University]], which dates back to 1883 and is one of Britain's major civic universities.

The MEC's purpose is to conduct research and development in all major areas of Advanced Manufacturing and use the output to promote the introduction of new manufacturing technology and practice to industry. It was the first autonomous [[research center|research centre]] created by Cardiff University.&lt;ref name="psychcentral"&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = Cardiff University experts solve manufacturing problem | url = http://psychcentral.com/news/archives/2006-01/cu-cue011706.html | publisher = Psych Central | date = | accessdate = 5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The MEC conducts basic, strategic and applied research as well as technology transfer with partners from 22 countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas.  The research spans a broad spectrum of subjects, from [[Robotics]] and Microsystems, Sensor Systems, High-speed [[Automation]] and [[Intelligent Control]], [[Rapid manufacturing]], MicroManufacturing, [[Nanotechnology]], Quality Engineering, [[Multimedia]], [[Virtual Reality]] and Enterprise Information Management.

Since 1996, the Centre has received over £50 million in grants and contracts and has attracted hundreds of industrial partners.  In 2004, the MEC won two EC 6th Framework Networks of Excellence contracts totalling 15M Euros in value.  The two Networks of Excellence led by the MEC, I*PROMS and 4M, involve some 50 centres of excellence in the field of Advanced Manufacturing across the EU. 
  
As a Centre of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration (CETIC) sponsored by the [[Welsh Assembly]] Government (WAG) and the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF), the MEC has contributed significantly to the Welsh economy, having completed thousands of projects with local companies and helped to generate and safeguard jobs in the region.&lt;ref name="cardiff"&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Manufacturing Engineering Centre (MEC) - Quality of Research | url = http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/rae/results/mec/ | publisher = Cardiff University | date =  | accessdate = 5 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220823/http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/rae/results/mec/ | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Under Professor Pham's leadership, the MEC was awarded the DTI University/Industry First Prize by the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] for its success in  building research partnerships with industry (March 1999), and the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher and Further Education in recognition of its contribution made to the economy (February 2001).&lt;ref name="cardiff" /&gt;

'''Masturbation''' is the [[sexual stimulation]] of one's own [[Sex organ|genitals]] for [[sexual arousal]] or other sexual pleasure, usually to the point of [[orgasm]].&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Robinson|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/masturbation-guide |title=Masturbation – Is Masturbation Normal or Harmful? Who Masturbates? Why Do People Masturbate? |publisher=[[WebMD]]|date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulation may involve hands, [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingers]], everyday objects, [[sex toy]]s such as [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]], or combinations of these.&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Based on "masturbation" in ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Manual stimulation of a partner, such as [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], a [[handjob]] or [[mutual masturbation]], is a common sexual act and can be a substitute for [[sexual penetration|penetration]]. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No [[Causality|causal]] relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=Eli |year=2012|orig-year=2002 | chapter-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150722160223/http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317787587_sample_833458.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |editor1-last=Bockting |editor1-first=Walter O. |editor2-last=Coleman |editor2-first=Eli |chapter = Masturbation as a Means of Achieving Sexual Health | title=Masturbation as a Means of Achieving Sexual Health |location=New York |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |publication-date= |page=7 |nopp= |isbn=978-0-7890-2047-5 |oclc=50913590 |quote=Despite the scientific evidence indicating that masturbation is generally a normal variant of sexual expression and that it does not seem to have a causal relationship with sexual pathology, negative attitudes about masturbation persist and it remains stigmatized.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times and is mentioned and discussed in very early writings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it as "heinous", "deplorable", and "hideous", but during the 20th century these [[taboo]]s generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. Today, religions vary in their [[Religious views on masturbation|views]] of masturbation; some view it as a spiritually detrimental practice, some see it as not spiritually detrimental, and others take a [[Situational ethics|situational]] view. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hallikeri |first1=Vinay R. |last2=Gouda |first2=Hareesh S. |last3=Aramani |first3=Sunil C. |last4=Vijaykumar |first4=A.G. |last5=Ajaykumar |first5=T.S. |date=July–December 2010 |title=MASTURBATION—AN OVERVIEW |url=http://www.jfmtonline.org/current/masterbation_an_overview.php |journal=Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=46–49 |issn=0971-1929 |quote=Today, masturbatory act is considered as a healthy practice when done in private and an offence if done in the public in most of the countries. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821082841/http://www.jfmtonline.org/current/masterbation_an_overview.php |archivedate=21 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], masturbation in private or with a partner is generally considered a normal and healthy part of sexual enjoyment. [[Animal masturbation]] has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity.&lt;ref name="Poiani2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aldo Poiani|title=Animal Homosexuality: A Biosocial Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EftT_1bsPOAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=(masturbation%20OR%20masturbate)&amp;f=false|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49038-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petplace.com/horses/breeding-soundness-examination-of-the-stallion/page2.aspx |title=Breeding Soundness Examination of the Stallion |publisher=Petplace.com |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905032903/http://www.petplace.com/horses/breeding-soundness-examination-of-the-stallion/page2.aspx |archivedate=5 September 2011 |date=2014-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagemihl,1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bagemihl, Bruce |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xpi2NI-Dz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=(masturbate%20OR%20masturbation)&amp;f=false|title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity|publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-312-19239-6 |accessdate=21 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The English word ''masturbation'' was introduced in the 18th century, based on the Latin verb ''masturbari'', alongside the slightly earlier ''onanism''.
The [[Latin]] verb ''masturbari'' is of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Masturbation|uncertain origin]].  Suggested derivations include an unattested word for [[human penis|penis]], ''*mazdo'', cognate with [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]   ''mézea'' ''μέζεα'', "genitals", or alternatively a corruption of an unattested ''*manusturpare'' ("to defile with the hand"), by association with ''turbare'' "to disturb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dally |first=Peter |title=The Fantasy Factor |year=1975 |page=135 |publisher=George Weidenfeld and Nicolson Limited |isbn=978-0-297-76945-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', s.v. ''[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114847 masturbation]{{subscription required}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

While ''masturbation'' is the formal word for this practice, many other expressions are in common use. Terms such as ''playing with yourself'', ''pleasuring oneself'' and slang such as ''wanking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darby, R. |title=Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation |journal=Journal of Social History |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''jerking off'',&lt;ref&gt;Shamans Sex Beasts and Abuse: Mother-Son Relationships in Popular and Cult Cinema. Charles Jason Lee.  Film International, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Frig (interjection)|frigging]]'' are common. ''Self-abuse'' and ''self-pollution'' were common in early modern times and are still found in modern dictionaries. A large variety of other [[euphemism]]s and [[dysphemism]]s exist which describe masturbation. For a list of terms, see the entry for ''[[wikt:Wikisaurus:masturbate|masturbate]]'' in [[Wiktionary]].

== Techniques ==

[[File:Vibratoren bunt DSCF7424.jpg|thumb|right|Two vibrators in a [[sex shop]]]]

Masturbation involves touching, pressing, rubbing, or massaging a person's [[genital]] area, either with the fingers or against an object such as a [[pillow]]; inserting fingers or an object into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] (see [[anal masturbation]]); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the [[nipple]]s or other [[erogenous zones]] while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply [[personal lubricant|lubricating]] substances to intensify sensation.

Reading or viewing [[pornography]], [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], or other erotic stimuli may lead to a desire for sexual release such as by masturbation.

Some people get [[sexual pleasure]] by inserting objects, such as [[Urethral sounding|urethral sounds]], into the [[urethra]] (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows),&lt;ref name="Alice05"&gt;{{cite web|author="Alice"  |title = Go ask Alice!: Cock-stuffing |publisher = Columbia University, New York |date = 18 February 2005 |url = http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/cock-stuffing |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice known as [[urethral play]] or "sounding".&lt;ref name="BME06"&gt;{{cite web |last = Various authors |title = Urethral Sound |publisher = Body Modification Ezine |date = 21 April 2006 |url = http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Urethral_Sound |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects such as ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury and/or infection.&lt;ref name="JAAPA06"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McPartlin |first1=Daniel |last2=Klausner |first2=Adam P. |last3=Berry |first3=Tristan T. |last4=Mulcahy |first4=Maurice |title=Case report: A foreign body in the urethra |journal=International Journal of Surgery Case Reports |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1052–4 |date=9 September 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.07.017 |pmid=24055017 |pmc=3825963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people masturbate by using [[Fucking machine|machines]] that simulate intercourse.

Men and women may masturbate until they are close to orgasm, stop for a while to reduce excitement, and then resume masturbating. They may repeat this cycle multiple times.

=== Male ===

Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing.

The most common masturbation technique among males is to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft. This type of stimulation is typically all that is required to achieve [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]]. The speed of the hand motion varies throughout the masturbation session.

Male masturbation techniques may differ between males who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]] and those who have not. Some techniques which may work for one individual can be difficult or uncomfortable for another. For males who have not been circumcised, stimulation of the penis typically comes from the "pumping" of the [[foreskin]], whereby the foreskin is held and slid up and down over the [[glans penis|glans]], which, depending on foreskin length, is completely or partially covered and then uncovered in a rapid motion. The outer foreskin glides smoothly over the inner foreskin. The glans itself may widen and lengthen as the stimulation continues, becoming slightly darker in colour, while the [[Foreskin#Functions|gliding action]] of the foreskin reduces friction. This technique may also be used by some circumcised men who have sufficient excess skin remaining from their circumcision.

For circumcised males, on whom the glans is mostly or completely uncovered, this technique creates more direct contact between the hand and the glans. To avoid friction, irritation and soreness from this resulting friction, some may prefer to use a personal lubricant, [[masturbation cream]], or [[saliva]].

The shaft skin can also be slid back and forth with just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A variation on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a [[simulacrum]], or [[artificial vagina]].

[[Prostate massage]] is one other technique used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Naveed|last=Saleh|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, by stimulating it using a well-lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the [[rectum]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce stronger and more powerful orgasms than  penile stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Stimulating the prostate from outside, via pressure on the [[perineum]], can be pleasurable as well. 

[[Anal masturbation]] without any prostate stimulation, with fingers or otherwise, is also one other technique which some men enjoy. Since the muscles of the anus contract during [[orgasm]], the presence of an object holding the [[sphincter]] open can strengthen the sensation of the contractions and intensify orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sinclair Intimacy Institute|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |title=Discovery: Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613200634/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |archivedate=2002-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice may be pleasurable because of the large number of [[nerve endings]] in the [[Human anus|anal area]], and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the [[sphincter ani externus muscle|anal sphincter muscles]] while inserting the finger. A good quality [[personal lubricant]] is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers.

There are many other variations on male masturbation techniques. Men may also rub or massage the glans, the rim of the glans, and the [[frenular delta]]. Some men place both hands directly on their penis during masturbation, while others may use their free hand to [[fondle]] their [[testicles]], [[nipples]], or other parts of their body.  The nipples are erogenous zones, and vigorous stimulation of them during masturbation usually causes the penis to become erect more quickly than it would otherwise.  Some may keep their hand stationary while pumping into it with pelvic thrusts in order to simulate the motions of [[sexual intercourse]]. Some may lay in the [[prone position]] and rub their genitals against the bed sheet or other surface, a technique called ''prone masturbation''.&lt;ref name="Prone Masturbation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Confidential|first1=Kinsey|title=Prone masturbation a threat?|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/10/prone-masturbation-a-threat-probably-not|website=Indiana Daily Student|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bath or shower a male may direct water via a handheld [[shower]]head at his frenelum, testicles, or perineum. Others may also use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation. 

A somewhat controversial ejaculation control technique is to put pressure on the perineum, about halfway between the [[scrotum]] and the anus, just before ejaculating.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as [[retrograde ejaculation]]).

=== Female ===

{{See also|Fingering (sexual act)}}

Female masturbation involves the stroking or rubbing of a woman's [[vulva]], especially her [[clitoris]], with an [[index finger|index]] or [[middle finger]]s, or both. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to stroke its frontal wall where the [[G-spot]] may be located.&lt;ref name="Keesling99"&gt;{{cite web |last = Keesling |first = Barbara |title = Beyond Orgasmatron |publisher = Psychology Today |date = November 1999|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199911/beyond-orgasmatron |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, [[dildo]], or [[Ben Wa balls]] can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] is involved, but this is not universal and many women find their [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] sufficient.

Like males, common positions for female masturbation include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing. In a bath or shower a female may direct water via a handheld showerhead at her clitoris, vulva, or perineum. Lying face down one may use the hands, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and "[[dry hump|hump]]" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, a chair, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.  Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against [[underwear]] or other clothing. In the 1920s, [[Havelock Ellis]] reported that turn-of-the-century seamstresses using treadle-operated sewing machines could achieve orgasm by sitting near the edge of their chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Havelock (1927), Studies in the Psychology of Sex (3rd edition), Volume I,; Auto-Eroticism: A Study of the Spontaneous Manifestations of the Sexual Impulse; section I; "The Sewing-machine and the Bicycle:" quotes one Pouillet as saying "it is a well-recognized fact that to work a sewing-machine with the body in a certain position produces sexual excitement leading to the orgasm. The occurrence of the orgasm is indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds with uncontrollable rapidity. This sound is said to be frequently heard in large French workrooms, and it is part of the duty of the superintendents of the rooms to make the girls sit properly." {{Gutenberg|no=13610|name=Studies in the Psychology of Sex, v. I, by Havelock Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women can stimulate themselves sexually by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.&lt;ref name="Koedt70"&gt;{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = https://www.cwluherstory.org/classic-feminist-writings-articles/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm |accessdate = 18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kins&gt;The Kinsey Institute [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html#masturbation Data from Alfred Kinsey's studies]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081833/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html |date=26 October 2007 }}.

Sex therapists will sometimes recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, for example to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically pleasing to them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy.&lt;ref name="Shuman06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles02"/&gt;

'''Mutual masturbation''' involves two or more people who sexually stimulate each other, usually with the hands. It can be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]], and can be part of other sexual activity. It may be used as [[foreplay]], or as an alternative to sexual penetration. When used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, the goal may be to preserve [[virgin]]ity or to avoid risk of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11&amp;lpg=PT11] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 47–49] for views on what constitutes virginity loss and therefore sexual intercourse or other sexual activity; source discusses how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in penile-vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Mutual masturbation can be practiced in pairs or groups with or without actually touching another person for example:
;Non-contact mutual masturbation: Two people masturbating in the presence of each other but not touching.
;Contact mutual masturbation: One person touching another person to masturbate. The other person may do the same during or after.
;Non-contact group: More than two people masturbating in the presence of each other in a group but not touching each other.
;Contact group: More than two people physically touching each other to masturbate as a group.

== Frequency, age, and sex ==

Frequency of masturbation is determined by many factors, e.g., one's resistance to [[sexual tension]], [[hormone]] levels influencing [[sexual arousal]], sexual habits, peer influences, health and one's attitude to masturbation formed by culture; E. Heiby and J. Becker examined the latter.&lt;ref name=Heiby80&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01542263|last1=Heiby|first1=Elaine|last2=Becker |first2=James D.|date=April 1980|title=Effect of filmed modeling on the self-reported frequency of masturbation|journal=Arch.

Different studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans. [[Alfred Kinsey|Alfred Kinsey's]] 1950s studies on US population&lt;!--what age, location--&gt; have shown that 92% of men and 62% of women have masturbated during their lifespan.&lt;ref name="kins" /&gt; Similar results have been found in a 2007 British national probability survey. It was found that, between individuals aged 16 to 44, 95% of men and 71% of women masturbated at some point in their lives. 73% of men and 37% of women reported masturbating in the four weeks before their interview, while 53% of men and 18% of women reported masturbating in the previous seven days.&lt;ref name=gerr&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerressu | first=Makeda | last2=Mercer | first2=Catherine H. | last3=Graham | first3=Cynthia A. | last4=Wellings | first4=Kaye | last5=Johnson | first5=Anne M. | title=Prevalence of Masturbation and Associated Factors in a British National Probability Survey | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=37 | issue=2 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9123-6 | pages=266–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship. Contrary to this belief, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse. A study has reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship.&lt;ref name=gerr /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heilborn Cabral 2006 pp. 1471–1481"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Heilborn | first=Maria Luiza | last2=Cabral | first2=Cristiane S. | title=Sexual practices in youth: analysis of lifetime sexual trajectory and last sexual intercourse | journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública | publisher=FapUNIFESP (SciELO) | volume=22 | issue=7 | year=2006 | issn=0102-311X | doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2006000700011 | pages=1471–1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Menon Williams Watson pp. 125–127"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Menon | first=Anuradha | last2= McAllister-Williams | first2=R.

== Evolutionary utility ==
Female masturbation alters conditions in the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on the timing of the masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such an orgasm can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Baker |first = Robin |title = Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex |publisher = Diane Books Publishing Company |date=June 1996 |isbn = 978-0-7881-6004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females&gt;{{cite journal |last = Baker |first = Robin R. |author2=Bellis, Mark A. |date=November 1993 |title = Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm |journal = Animal Behaviour |volume = 46 |issue = 5 |pages = 87, 23p |doi = 10.1006/anbe.1993.1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix.&lt;ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females /&gt;

In males, masturbation flushes out old sperm with low [[motility]] from the male's genital tract.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense.

The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth &amp; Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as "bad" or "wrong."

Sex therapists will sometimes recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, for example to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically pleasing to them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy.&lt;ref name="Shuman06"&gt;{{cite web |last = Shuman |first = Tracy |title = Your Guide to Masturbation |publisher = WebMD, Inc./The Cleveland Clinic Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology |date = February 2006 |url = http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/masturbation-guide |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles02"&gt;{{cite web |last = Knowles |first = Jon |title = Masturbation — From Stigma to Sexual Health |publisher = Katharine Dexter McCormick Library/Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. |date = November 2002 |url = https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/5513/9611/7867/masturbation_11-02.pdf |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the "map to [their] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. Intercourse, by itself, is often inconvenient or impractical at times to provide sufficient sexual release for many people. Mutual masturbation allows couples to enjoy each other and obtain sexual release as often as they need but without the inconveniences and risks associated with sex.&lt;ref name="BadgerHerald" /&gt;

In 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of [[The Cancer Council Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Giles | first=G.G. |author2=G.  Severi |author3=D.R.

Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had significantly lower risk. However they could not show a direct causation. The study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases (STDs) that may increase the [[Cervical cancer#Causes|risk of cancer]] instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent ejaculation between the ages of 20 and 40 may be correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, frequent ejaculation in one's 50s was found to be correlated with a lower such risk in this same study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Polyxeni Dimitropoulou | author2=Douglas Easton | author3=Richard Pocock | author4=David P.

A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.

{{quote|quote=The association between frequency of orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recorded as number of orgasms per year. The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95).}}
That is, a difference in mortality appeared between any two subjects when one subject ejaculated at around two times per week more than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3 and 5 ejaculations per week for healthy males, this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer.  The strength of these correlations increased with increasing frequency of ejaculation.&lt;ref name="Smith Frankel Yarnell pp. 1641–1644"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = George Davey | last2 =Frankel | first2= Stephen | last3= Yarnell | first3= John | title=Sex and death: are they related?

Solo masturbation is a sexual activity that is free of risk of [[sexually transmitted infections]]. With two or more participants, the risk of sexually transmitted infections, while not eliminated, is much less than with most forms of [[penetrative sex]]. Support for such a view, and for making masturbation part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] [[Joycelyn Elders]] during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]. Some [[European Union|EU Nations]] promote masturbation in their sex education curricula.

Sexual climax, from masturbation or otherwise, leaves one in a relaxed and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by drowsiness and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutherland|first=Tammy|title=Six healthy reasons to masturbate|url=http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/girlfriends-guide/6-healthy-reasons-to-masturbate|website=Best Health Magazine|publisher=Reader's Digest Magazines (Canada)|accessdate=4 July 2013|quote="Just as people fall into a deep sleep after sex with a partner, because blood pressure is lowered and relaxation is increased through the release of endorphins, masturbation is a good sleeping pill," says Golden.

Those who insert objects as aids to masturbation risk them becoming stuck (e.g. as [[rectal foreign body|rectal foreign bodies]]). Men and women can fall prey to this problem.

=== Pregnancy ===

Solo masturbation, or masturbation involving individuals of the same sex, cannot produce pregnancy. Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see ''[[Non-penetrative sex#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]]'') can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva.

{{details|Hypersexuality}}

Compulsive masturbation and other compulsive behaviors can be signs of an emotional problem, which may need to be addressed by a mental health specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/ohe/library/Sexhealth/articles/masturbating.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820190232/http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/ohe/library/Sexhealth/articles/masturbating.htm|archivedate=20 August 2010 |author=Office of Health Education|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|title=Masturbation|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any "nervous habit", it is more helpful to consider the causes of compulsive behavior, rather than try to repress masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chmed.com/behavioral-care/child-development/masturbation/ |author=Children's Medical Office of North Andover, P.C.|title=Masturbation in Early Childhood |publisher=Chmed.com |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masturbation among adolescents contributes to their developing a sense of mastery over sexual impulses, and it has a role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents.&lt;ref name=Datta&gt;{{cite book|author=Parul Datta|title=Pediatric Nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um1_7gM-E1wC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers|year=2007|accessdate=27 August 2011|page=189|isbn=9788180619700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals in much the same way as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection. The child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or understimulated and bored. 

Alongside many other factors—such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play and precocious or seductive behavior—excessive masturbation may be an indicator of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

The [[Human sexuality|sexual]] stimulation of one's own [[sex organ|genitals]] has been [[Religious views on masturbation|interpreted variously by different religions]], the subject of legislation, social controversy, activism, as well as intellectual study in [[sexology]]. Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history.

There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric [[rock painting]]s around the world. From the earliest records, the ancient [[Sumer]]ians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|chapter-url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Men would often use ''puru''-oil, a special oil probably mixed with pulverized [[iron ore]] intended to enhance friction.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Masturbation was also an act of creation and, in [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], the god [[Enki]] was believed to have created the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty [[Stream bed|riverbeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|page=32|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also regarded masturbation by a deity as an act of creation; the god [[Atum]] was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation.

The [[ancient Greeks]] also regarded masturbation as a normal and healthy substitute for other forms of sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenfeld|first=Jennie|title=Talmudic Re-readings: Toward a Modern Orthodox Sexual Ethic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e6TnaciudcC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-43458-0|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most information about masturbation in ancient Greece comes from surviving works of [[ancient Greek comedy]] and [[Pottery of ancient Greece|pottery]].&lt;ref name="Stafford2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stafford|first=Emma|date=2011|chapter=Clutching the chickpea: private pleasures of the bad boyfriend|title=Sociable Man: Essays on Ancient Greek Social Behaviour in Honour of Nick Fisher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EflODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=satyrs+masturbation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj48aqW04neAhUYo4MKHfpxDOkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=satyrs%20masturbation&amp;f=false|editor1-last=Lambert|editor1-first=S.

Among non-western perspectives on the matter, some teachers and practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine, Taoist meditative and martial arts say that masturbation can cause a lowered energy level in men.

====18th century====
''Onanism'' is a hybrid term which combines the proper noun, ''[[Onan]]'', with the suffix, ''-ism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Onanism." ''The Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 16 July. 2017. &lt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Onanism&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notions of self-pollution, impurity and uncleanness were increasingly associated with various other sexual vices and crimes of the body (such fornication, sodomy, adultery, incest and obscene language); in reaction to the 17th-century libertine culture, middle-class moralists increasingly campaigned for a reformation of manners and a stricter regulation of the body. Paradoxically, a crime that was secret and private became a popular and fashionable topic. Moreover, writers tended to focus more on the perceived links with mental and physical illnesses that were deemed to be associated with the sense of moral outrage. Attention increasingly shifted to the prevention and cure of this illness which perilously sapped men of their virility&lt;ref&gt;See ''Traité contre l’impureté'' (1707) and ''The Nature of Uncleanness'' (1708); Ian McCormick ed. ''Sexual Outcasts: Onanism''. Vol. 4. (London and New York: Routledge, 2000). pp. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716 and attributed&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, David and Emma Ellis. ''Resolution: Two Brothers. A Nation in Crisis. A World at War.'' London: Head of Zeus. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to Dutch theologian Dr. [[Balthazar Bekker]], titled "Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." The Online Etymology Dictionary, however, claims the earliest known use of ''onanism'' occurred in 1727. In 1743–45, the British physician [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]] published ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. ''Masturbation: the history of a great terror''. New York: Palgrave, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56 pp. 56–57]. {{ISBN|0-312-22443-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in ''Onania'' was the notable Swiss physician [[Samuel-Auguste Tissot]]. In 1760, he published ''L'Onanisme'', his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered [[hypothesis|conjectural]] at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent.

Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797), he made the ''[[a posteriori]]'' argument that "such an unnatural use of one's sexual attribute" strikes "everyone upon his thinking of it" as "a violation of one's duty to himself", and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that "it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use", but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that "a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Emmanuel|title=The Metaphysics of Morals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56673-5|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcrTG6tJsAC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Mary J.

====19th century====

By 1838 [[Jean Esquirol]] had declared in his ''Des Maladies Mentales'' that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Hare (1962) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/108/452/1.full.pdf Masturbatory Insanity: The History of an Idea], [[Journal of Mental Science]] 108:4 (issue #452)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], pages 65,6&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor [[John Harvey Kellogg]] and [[Sylvester Graham|Rev. Sylvester Graham]] were among those who proposed that [[circumcision]] and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link1=John Harvey Kellogg |last1=Kellogg |first1=John Harvey |title=Plain Facts for Old And Young|page=325|year=1910|hdl=2027/ucw.ark:/13960/t53f53t5w }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, [[infibulation]], restraining devices like [[chastity belt]]s and [[straitjacket]]s, [[cauterization]] or – as a last resort – wholesale [[Castration|surgical excision]] of the genitals.

Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change towards the end of the 19th century when [[H. Havelock Ellis]], in his seminal 1897 work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', questioned Tissot's premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |first2=Anne |last2=van Neck|title=Masturbation: the history of a great terror |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133|isbn=978-0-312-22443-1 | year=2001 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====

In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] addressed masturbation in his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' and associated it with addictive substances.  He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty.  At the same time, the supposed medical condition of [[female hysteria|hysteria]]&amp;mdash;from the Greek ''hystera'' or uterus&amp;mdash;was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women.  In 1910, the meetings of the [[Vienna psychoanalytic circle]] discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation,&lt;ref name="Bennett 1999 pp. 269–294"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bennett | first=David | title=Burghers, Burglars, and Masturbators: The Sovereign Spender in the Age of Consumerism | journal=New Literary History | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=30 | issue=2 | year=1999 | issn=1080-661X | doi=10.1353/nlh.1999.0018 | pages=269–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its publication on the matter was suppressed. [[Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation]] is a 1922 [[essay]] by another [[Austrians|Austrian]], the [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Wilhelm Reich]]. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of [[unconscious fantasy]] and the subsequent emerging [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.

By 1930, Dr. [[F. W. W. Griffin]], editor of ''The Scouter,'' had written in a book for [[Rover Scouts]] stating that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing [[H. Havelock Ellis|Ellis]]' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error." The work of sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the [[Kinsey Reports]], insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females.  In the US masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] II (1968).&lt;ref name="Ley2014"/&gt;

[[Thomas Szasz]] states the shift in [[scientific consensus]]:&lt;ref name=patton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patton|first=Michael S.|date=June 1985|title=Masturbation from Judaism to Victorianism|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=24|issue=2|pages=133–146|issn=0022-4197|doi=10.1007/BF01532257|quote=Social change in attitudes toward masturbation has occurred at the professional level only since 1960 and at the popular level since 1970.

In the 1980s [[Michel Foucault]] was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children". However, in 1994, when the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], Dr. [[Joycelyn Elders]], mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school [[curriculum|curricula]] that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jeff|last1=Jelq|url=http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/elders.html |title=JackinLibrary: Joycelyn Elders |publisher=Jackinworld.com |date= |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of ''how'' to masturbate.

====21st century====

Both practices and cultural views of masturbation have continued to evolve in the 21st Century, partly because the contemporary [[lifeworld]] is increasingly technical.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}}  For example, digital photographs or live video may be used to share masturbatory experiences either in a broadcast format (possibly in exchange of money, as with performances by "[[camgirl]]s" and "[[camboy]]s"), or between members of a [[long-distance relationship]]. [[Teledildonics]] is a growing field.  Masturbation has been depicted as a not-uncomplicated part of "Love in the 21st Century" in the BBC drama by the same name.&lt;ref name="channel4.com 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=Love in the 21st Century - Episode Guide - Channel 4 | website=channel4.com | date=2009-06-16 | url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616081408/https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-date=2009-06-16 | dead-url=yes | access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern culture ==

=== Sperm donation ===

Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |title=Donor insemination – how does it work? |publisher=Hfea.gov.uk |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008094517/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sperm-donation/basics/definition/prc-20009520 |title=Sperm donation Definition – Tests and Procedures |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as artificial insemination. Most semen used for [[sperm donation]], and all semen donated through a sperm bank by sperm donors, is produced in this way. The facility at a sperm bank used for this purpose is known as a masturbatorium (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OHasan |url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/siw198q/websites/reprotech/New%20Ways%20of%20Making%20Babies/spermint.htm |title=What Does Sperm Donation Involve? |publisher=Web.stanford.edu |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encouraged masturbation ===

In the UK in 2009, a leaflet was issued by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in [[Sheffield]] carrying the slogan, "an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away". It also says: "Health promotion experts advocate five portions of fruit and veg a day and 30 minutes' physical activity three times a week. What about sex or masturbation twice a week?" This leaflet has been circulated to parents, teachers and youth workers and is meant to update sex education by telling older school students about the benefits of enjoyable sex. Its authors have said that for too long, experts have concentrated on the need for "safe sex" and committed relationships while ignoring the principal reason that many people have sex. The leaflet is entitled ''Pleasure''. Instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience, said one of its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Spanish region of [[Extremadura]] launched a programme in 2009 to encourage "sexual self-exploration and the discovery of self-pleasure" in people aged from 14 to 17. The €14,000 campaign includes leaflets, flyers, a "fanzine", and workshops for the young in which they receive instruction on masturbation techniques along with advice on contraception and self-respect. The initiative, whose slogan is, "Pleasure is in your own hands" has angered local right-wing politicians and challenged traditional Roman Catholic views. Officials from the neighbouring region of [[Andalucia]] have expressed an interest in copying the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The text book ''Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life'' states, "Terminally ill people are likely no different from the general population regarding their masturbation habits. Palliative care practitioners should routinely ask their patients if anything interferes in their ability to masturbate and then work with the patient to correct the problem if it is identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matzo|first=Marianne |title=Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life|year=2006|publisher=Springer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8261-5791-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rTexGiX5bqoC&amp;pg=PA70|author2=Deborah Witt Sherman|accessdate=26 May 2010|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===

The prosecution of masturbation has varied at different times, from virtually unlimited acceptance to complete illegality. In a 17th-century law code for the [[Puritan]] colony of [[New Haven Colony|New Haven, Connecticut]] "[[blasphemy|blasphemers]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and masturbators" were eligible for the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Often, masturbation in the sight of others is prosecuted under a general law such as [[public indecency]], though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2013-09-19"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Masturbation laws around the world: the penal code|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/blog/2013/sep/19/masturbation-laws-world-penal-code|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, laws vary from state to state.

In many jurisdictions, masturbation by one person of another is considered [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] which may be illegal in some cases, such as when the other person is a minor.

There is debate whether masturbation should be promoted in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany masturbation, are common in [[Incarceration in the United States|American correctional facilities]]. [[Connecticut Department of Correction]]s officials say that these restrictions are intended to avoid a [[hostile work environment]] for [[correctional officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connecticut Prisoners Express Anger Over Porn Ban|author=Eaton-Robb, Pat|date=8 October 2011|url=http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2011/10/08/connecticut-prisoners-express-anger-over-porn-ban/|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers argue allowing masturbation could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in [[prison rape]] or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Free Willy|author=Johns, David Merritt|date=10 January 2012|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/01/should_prison_inmates_have_the_right_to_masturbate_.single.html|publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions vary broadly in their views of masturbation, from considering it completely impermissible ([[Religious views on masturbation#Catholicism|as in Roman Catholicism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action."The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose". For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved".

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encouraging and refining it (as, for example, in some [[Neotantra]] and [[Taoist sexual practices]]).

=== Rites of passage ===

The [[Sambia people|Sambia]] tribe of [[New Guinea]] has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which lasts several years and involves ejaculation through [[fellatio]] often several times a day. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Moffatt|url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |title=The Sambia |publisher=Faculty.mdc.edu |date=4 October 1999 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050114/http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |archivedate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2013}}

Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hewlett, B.S. |chapter=Diverse contexts of human infancy |editor=Ember, C. |editor2=Ember, M. |title=Cross-Cultural Research for Social Science |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs NJ |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a "wise elder" or "witch doctor" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size.

=== Stigma ===

Even though many [[medical]] professionals and [[scientist]]s have found large amounts of evidence that masturbating is healthy&lt;ref name="Merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szasz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shpancer2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sigel2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strassberg2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ley2014" /&gt; and commonly practiced by males and females, stigma on the topic still persists today.  In November 2013, Matthew Burdette, after being filmed masturbating, committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Scowen|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/we-need-to-talk-about-masturbation-the-last-great-sexual-taboo/article19678627/|title=We need to talk about masturbation, the last great sexual taboo|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/boy-scout-14-took-own-life-after-being-mercilessly-bullied-over-viral-sex-act-video-30436799.html|title=Matthew Burdette: Boy Scout, 14, took his own life after being 'bullied' over 'viral video'|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Scowen|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/relationships/bullying-shame-suicide-why-is-masturbation-still-stigmatized/article19730945/|title=Bullying, shame, suicide – why is masturbation still stigmatized?|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Proving that these ancient stigmas against masturbation are still alive and felt by women and men, researchers in 1994 found that half of the adult women and men who masturbate feel guilty about it (Laumann, et al., 1994. p.85).

There are depictions of male masturbation in prehistoric [[rock painting]]s around the world.

=== Music ===
In popular music, there are various songs that deal with masturbation. Some of the earliest examples are "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]" by [[Chuck Berry]] and "Mary Ann with the Shaky Hand" and "[[Pictures of Lily]]" by [[The Who]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pete Townshend |authorlink=Pete Townshend |title=Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy |version=Printed article |publisher="Rolling Stone or one of the similar magazines (Melody Maker, NME, etc.)" |year=1971 |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~dmcguire/meatybeaty.html |accessdate=9 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123083202/http://home.roadrunner.com/~dmcguire/meatybeaty.html |archivedate=23 January 2009 |df=dmy }} "Merely a ditty about masturbation and the importance of it to a young man.

More recent popular songs include "[[Running on Empty (album)|Rosie]]" by [[Jackson Browne]], "[[Una luna de miel en la mano]]" by [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]], "[[I Touch Myself]]" by the [[Divinyls]], "Very Busy People" by [[The Limousines]], "[[Dancing With Myself]]" by [[Billy Idol]], "[[Hybrid (Gary Numan album)|Everyday I Die]]" by [[Gary Numan]], "[[You're Makin' Me High]]" by [[Toni Braxton]], "[[Permission to Land|Holding My Own]]" by [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], "[[Neon Nights|Vibe On]]" by [[Dannii Minogue]], "[[Orgasm Addict]]" by the [[Buzzcocks]], "[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]" by [[Billy Joel]], "Blister in the Sun" by [[Violent Femmes]], "[[Longview (song)|Longview]]" by [[Green Day]], "M+Ms" by [[Blink-182]], "[[Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too]]" by [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]], "Fingers" and "[[U + Ur Hand]]" by [[P!nk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/pink-the-outspoken-pop-star-on-fame-and-growing-up-471290.html|title= Pink: The outspoken pop star on fame and growing up|last=McLean|first=Craig|date=25 March 2006|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[So Happy I Could Die]]" by [[Lady Gaga]], "Masturbating Jimmy" by [[The Tiger Lillies]], "When Life Gets Boring " by [[Gob (band)|Gob]], "Get a Grip" by [[Semisonic]], and "[[Darling Nikki]]" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].

The song "Masturbates" by rock group [[Mindless Self Indulgence]] also deals with the concept of auto-erotic activity in a [[punk subculture|punk]] framework.

=== Literature ===

The 1858 schoolboys' novel ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' was a tract against masturbation, but did not mention the subject except extremely obliquely as "[[Kibroth-Hattaavah]]" a place mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] where those that lusted after meat were buried.

In October 1972, an important censorship case was held in Australia, leading to the banning of [[Philip Roth|Philip Roth's]] novel ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' in that country due to its masturbation references. The censorship led to public outcry at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Don Chipp: larrikin, censor, and party founder |date=August 2006 |publisher=Crikey  |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2006/08/29/don-chipp-larrikin-censor-and-party-founder/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further portrayals and references to masturbation have occurred throughout literature, and the practice itself has even contributed to the production of literature among certain writers, such as [[Thomas Wolfe|Wolfe]], [[Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and [[John Cheever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2013/daily_rituals/balzac_and_sex_how_the_french_novelist_used_masturbation_to_fuel_his_writing.html |title = Daily Rituals |last = Currey |first = Mason |date = 30 April 2013 |journal = Slate |accessdate=  10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perhaps the most famous fictional depiction of masturbation occurs in the "Nausicaa" episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce. Here the novel's protagonist Bloom brings himself to covert climax during a public fireworks display after being aroused by a young woman's coy exhibitionism.

=== Television ===

In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Contest]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Seinfeld,' Four: It's Real and It's Spectacular |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/16/AR2005051600756.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=17 May 2005 |first=Jen |last=Chaney}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show's main characters enter into a contest to see who can go the longest without masturbating. Because ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s network, [[NBC]], did not think masturbation was a suitable topic for prime-time television, the word is never used. Instead, the subject is described using a series of euphemisms. "Master of my domain" became a part of the American lexicon from this episode.

Another NBC show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', had a character known as the Masturbating Bear, a costume of a bear with a diaper covering its genitals. The Masturbating Bear would touch his diaper to simulate masturbation. Prior to leaving ''Late Night'' to become host of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'', [[Conan O'Brien]] originally retired the character due to concerns about its appropriateness in an earlier time slot.&lt;ref name="warmingglow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2009/05/the-masturbating-bear-is-coming-back/ |title=The masturbating bear is coming back!!! |publisher=warmingglow.uproxx.com |accessdate=8 November 2013 |date=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Masturbating Bear however made his ''Tonight Show'' debut during the final days of Conan O'Brien's tenure as host of the ''Tonight Show''.  It was clear by then that Conan O'Brien was being removed from the show and he spent his last shows pushing the envelope with skits that typically would not be appropriate for the ''Tonight Show'', one of which was the Masturbating Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stableford |first=Dylan |url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/conan-finally-unleashes-masturbating-bear-video-13333 |title='Conan Finally Unleashes 'Masturbating Bear'&amp;#39; |publisher=Thewrap.com |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After much debate on whether or not he would be able to be used on Conan O'Brien's new [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', the Masturbating Bear made an appearance on the very first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/masturbating-bear-gets-new-job |title=Conan: Masturbating Bear Gets a New Job |publisher=Tbs.com |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 the UK broadcaster [[Channel 4]] was to air a season of [[television]] programmes about masturbation, called [[Wank Week]]. (''Wank'' is a [[British English|Briticism]] for ''masturbate''.) The series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials. However, its constituent films may yet be shown by the channel at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 February 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4|accessdate=2 November 2007| title='Wank week' postponed|author=Jason Deans|work= [[Media Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}

=== Pornography ===

Depictions of male and female masturbation are common in pornography, including [[gay pornography]].

Solo performances in gay pornography have been described in 1985 as "either or both active (tense, upright) and/or passive (supine, exposed, languid, available)", whereas female solo performances are said to be "exclusively passive (supine, spread, seated, squatted, orifices offered, etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Waugh, "[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/PornWaugh.html Men's Pornography: Gay vs. Straight]", ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'', no. 30, March 1985, pp. 30–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Solo pornography recognized with [[AVN Awards]] include the ''[[All Alone (pornographic films)|All Alone]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;"[http://avnawards.avn.com/past/winners/2010 2010 Winners] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20131207095914/http://avnawards.avn.com/past/winners/2010 |date=7 December 2013 }}", ''AVN Awards'', URL accessed 25 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''All Natural: Glamour Solos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.avn.com/articles/video/AVN-Announces-the-2012-AVN-Award-Winners-461715.html AVN – AVN Announces the 2012 AVN Award Winners].

'''Mental rotation''' is the ability to [[rotate]] [[mental image|mental representations]] of [[dimension|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects as it is related to the visual representation of such rotation within the human mind.&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|date=1971-02-19|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701|journal=Science|language=en|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Mental rotation, as a function of visual representation in the human brain, has been associated with the right [[cerebral hemisphere]]. There is a relationship between similar areas of the brain associated with [[perception]] and mental rotation. There could also be a relationship between the cognitive [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of spatial processing, general [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and mental rotation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=A.

Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is.

Mental rotation can be separated into the following [[Cognition|cognitive]] stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns)
# Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure)
# Make the comparison
# Decide if the objects are the same or not
# Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed)

==Assessment==
In a mental rotation [[Psychological assessment|test]], the participant compares two [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects (or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same [[image]] or if they are [[mirror image]]s ([[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]).&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"/&gt; Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (e.g. 0°, 60°, 120° or 180°). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how [[Accuracy|accurately]] and [[Rate (mathematics)|rapidly]] they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What does the Mental Rotation Test Measure?

==Notable research==

=== Shepard and Metzler (1971) ===

[[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. N., &amp; Metzler, J., "Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]'', Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their [[research]] showed that the [[reaction time]] for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was [[Linear#Linear functions|linearly]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[angle]] of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/1120/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf|journal=Science|year=1971|author1=Shepard, R. N.|author2=Metzler, J.|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|jstor=1731476|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vandenburg and Kuse (1978) ===
{{main|Mental Rotations Test}}
In 1978, [[Steven G. Vandenberg]] and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The [[Mental Rotations Test]] was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenberg|first=Steven|date=1978|title=Mental Rotations, a Group Test of Three-Dimensional Spatial Visualization|pmid=724398|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Michael|date=2005-03-01|title=Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604002398|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=57|issue=2|pages=176–184|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural activity ==
In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Irina M.|last2=Egan|first2=Gary F.|last3=Sonkkila|first3=Cynon|last4=Tochon-Danguy|first4=Henri J.|last5=Paxinos|first5=George|last6=Watson|first6=John D. G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Selective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/65|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1093/brain/123.1.65|issn=0006-8950|pmid=10611121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]&amp;nbsp;studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter-parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=Mental rotation of tactile stimuli|journal= Cognitive Brain Research|volume=14|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00063-0|pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogos|first=Andrea|last2=Gavrilescu|first2=Maria|last3=Davison|first3=Sonia|last4=Searle|first4=Karissa|last5=Adams|first5=Jenny|last6=Rossell|first6=Susan L.|last7=Bell|first7=Robin|last8=Davis|first8=Susan R.|last9=Egan|first9=Gary F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Greater superior than inferior parietal lobule activation with increasing rotation angle during mental rotation: An fMRI study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393209004163|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=2|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.013|pmid=19850055}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Clock rotated depth wise 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in depth 90 degrees]][[File:Clock rotated in the picture plane 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in the picture plane 90 degrees]]

==Color==
Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low [[spatial ability]] mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh &amp; Hegarty, 2008).

==Effect on athleticism and artistic ability==
Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., &amp; Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time.

Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease.

A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=a3da1b76-fd74-4640-abfb-c61d3a4ecdeb%2540sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d#AN=2016-29576-008&amp;db=psyh|title=Improvement of postural stability during quiet standing obtained after mental rotation of foot stimuli.|last=Kawasaki|first=Tsubasa|date=2017-07-11|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task.|journal=Human Movement Science|volume=37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamdi_Habacha/publication/264241628_Effects_of_the_axis_of_rotation_and_primordially_solicited_limb_of_high_level_athletes_in_a_mental_rotation_task/links/5a107ee0a6fdccc2d79997bf/Effects-of-the-axis-of-rotation-and-primordially-solicited-limb-of-high-level-athletes-in-a-mental-rotation-task.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys age 7–8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of rotational hand movements and general motor ability in children’s mental rotation performance.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gymnasts and orienteers display better mental rotation performance than nonathletes.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=37|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
Different studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks.

In order to explain this difference, we can look at the brain activation during a mental rotation task. In 2012, a study&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task.

A study from 2008 showed that this difference occurs early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number "1" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a "1" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the "1" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Liben|first2=Lynn S.|date=2008-11-01|title=A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1067|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1067–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02201.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=19076474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissan|first=Tali|last2=Shapira|first2=Oren|last3=Liberman|first3=Nira|date=2015-10-01|title=Effects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1425|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1425–1437|doi=10.1177/0146167215598748|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the [[autism spectrum disorders]].

One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB ([[extreme male brain]]). This theory considers that autist have an "extreme male brain". In a study&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Alexandra C.|last2=Glindemann|first2=Liv A.|last3=Vogeley|first3=Kai|last4=Falter|first4=Christine M.|date=2015-04-17|title=Sex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e0124628|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|issn=1932-6203|pmid=25884501|pmc=4401579}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this "male performance" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by "autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Current research directions==
{{Further information|Abstraction}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">[[File:Drexel 4180-4185.jpg|thumb|[[Drexel 4180—4185]], a set of six manuscript partbooks belonging to the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library]]]]
A '''partbook''' is a format for printing or copying music in which each book contains the [[part (music)|part]] for a single voice or instrument, especially popular during the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. This format contrasts with the large [[choirbook]], which included all of the voice parts and could be shared by an entire [[choir]]. The choirbook still followed the convention to notate the parts separately, but within a double page, likewise part books were arranged that they show the one extract of the composition on the same page.

The production of partbooks appears to have been a cost-cutting measure, as large-scale printing was much more expensive. For example, by 1529, [[King's College, Cambridge]] had replaced almost all of its choirbooks with partbooks. The reduced cost also allowed each performer to have his own copy, and partbooks were more portable than a choirbook. They were, however, flimsy, and originals do not survive in large numbers. 

Choral scores completely replaced individual vocal parts during the 19th century.  While instruments continue to use parts for ease of page turning, these are rarely bound into "books" and are no longer so called.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the romance genre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Polymorphous perversity''' is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept proposing the ability to gain [[sexual gratification]] outside [[social norm|socially normative]] sexual behaviors. [[Sigmund Freud]] used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five.

==Freud's theory==

Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / [[libido|libidinal]] drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], and [[Genital stage|genital / phallic stage]]. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive.

Freud taught that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, [[incest]]uous and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from [[breastfeeding|suckling at the breast]].

For Freud, "perversion" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

== Background ==
Many ornamental [[freshwater aquarium]] fish, including the cardinal tetra and the [[Discus (fish)|discus]] (''Symphysodon'' ssp.), are sourced from the [[Amazon River basin]] area.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Rio Negro region is the home of more than 100 different species of fish that are important to the pet fish trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/rio_negro|title = 314: Rio Negro|date = |accessdate = 6 August 2015|website = Freshwater Ecoregions of the World|publisher = The Nature Conservancy|last = Petry|first = Paulo|last2 = Hales|first2 = Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact several species, including cardinal tetras, show the adaptive trait of [[iridescence]] which may provide lower visibility in a [[Blackwater river|blackwater]] environment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Project ''Piaba'' started with an ecological [[Measurement|baseline]] study of the region which was conducted in 1989 by a group of researchers and students from the [[Federal University of Amazonas|Universidade do Amazonas]] (UA) and the National Institute of Amazon Research (INPA).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ornamental-fish-int.org/research-support/projeto-piaba|title = Project Piaba|last = Chao|first = Ning Labbish|date = May 2002|journal = Ornamental Fish International|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 August 2015|issue = 39|last2 = Prang|first2 = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial survey discovered and documented the importance of the fish trade to the local [[economy]] and it led the researchers to wonder about the impact the fishing had on the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Development ==
In the 1950s, [[Herbert R. Axelrod]] and Willi Schwarz had begun shipping aquarium fish out of [[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=PracFish&gt;[https://web.archive.org/save/http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/news/fishkeeping-news/articles/2017/5/30/obituary-dr-herbert-r-axelrod "Obituary: Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod"]. ''Practical Fishkeeping'', 30 May 2017. Archived 20 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Ning Labbish Chao and Gregory Prang founded Project ''Piaba'' in order to support the local fisheries and in concert with them, help protect the habitat of collected fishes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of the "gentle" way the fish are caught and the fact that most of the fish caught for the aquarium trade are short-lived and would naturally die out during the dry season, the ecological impact of catching the fish is considered minimal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fish are also not caught by fish farmers during their breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-species/freshwater-profiles/cardinal-tetra-2.aspx|title = Cardinal Tetra Fish Stats|date = |accessdate = 7 August 2015|website = Fish Channel|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal tetra, especially, is considered a [[renewable resource]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/06/24/endangered-fish-dna-barcoding|title = Can DNA Barcoding Really Save Endangered Fish?|last = Conniff|first = Richard|date = 24 June 2013|work = Take Part|access-date = 7 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project ''Piaba'' assesses the sustainability of the species farmed in the Rio Negro area by using the "[[F-distribution|F value]]" which estimates the portion of the catch from the total biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.opefe.com/PPiaba_webver.doc|title = Forever 'Project Piaba'|date = 2008|accessdate = 7 August 2015|website = Oregon Piranha Exotic Fish Exhibit (OPEFE)|publisher = |last = Chao|first = Ning Labbish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of the Rio Negro aquarium trade, [[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]], now celebrates ornamental fish in a festival held every January in conjunction with the annual research expedition of Project ''Piaba''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A stadium, known as Piabodrome, was even built for the festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first festival took place in 1994 and a permanent exhibit highlighting the fish was installed in Barcelos by Project ''Piaba'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tfhmagazine.com/details/articles/hope-along-the-rio-negro-part-1-the-view-from-manaus.htm|title = Hope Along the Rio Negro Part 1: The View From Manaus|last = Carey|first = Randy|date = March 2007|journal = The Fish Hobbyist Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money donated by [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]], [[Herbert R.

Scott Dowd is the current director of Project ''Piaba''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He leads the yearly expeditions with experts from around the world, volunteers and even family visiting the Amazon region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.boston.com/sponsored/extra/sponsored-ne-aquarium-fishstory|title = The Life Aquatic|last = Montgomery|first = Sy|date = 13 April 2015|work = The Boston Globe|access-date = 7 August 2015|via = Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has acted as a case study for other, similar projects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Areas such as the [[Western Ghats]] in [[India]] and areas of [[Bali]] are beginning to use similar practices in order to make money from the fish trade and sustain the environment of the fish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Project ''Piab''a is often used to show how groups can support the environment while providing economic stimulus to a poor region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.petproductnews.com/July-2015/International-Waters-Industry-Unfairly-Attacked--Again/|title = International Waters: Industry Unfairly Attacked...

'''Prostate massage''' is the [[massage]] or stimulation of the male [[prostate]] gland for medical purposes or [[sexual stimulation]].

The prostate takes part in the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], and is essential for the production of [[semen]]. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the [[rectum]] or externally via the [[perineum]].

==Medical uses==

===Digital rectal examination (DRE)===
Prostate massage is part of the digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) routinely given to men by [[urologists]] in order to look for nodules of [[prostate cancer]] and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for [[microscopy]] and [[microbiological culture]] to screen for [[prostatitis]].

====Therapy for prostatitis====
{{Main article|Prostatitis}}
In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of [[Prostatitis#Category II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis|chronic bacterial prostatitis]] with uncertain results.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Downey J, Feliciano AE, Hennenfent B |title=Repetitive prostatic massage therapy for chronic refractory prostatitis: the Philippine experience |journal=Techniques in Urology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=146–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10527258 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoskes DA, Zeitlin SI |title=Use of prostatic massage in combination with antibiotics in the treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal= Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases|volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159–162 |year=1999 |pmid=12496826 |doi=10.1038/sj.pcan.4500308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ateya A, Fayez A, Hani R, Zohdy W, Gabbar MA, Shamloul R |title=Evaluation of prostatic massage in treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal=Urology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=674–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16566972 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in [[western medicine]] for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should ''never'' be performed on patients with [[Prostatitis#Category I: Acute prostatitis (bacterial)|acute prostatitis]], because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.&lt;ref name="pmid10584615"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel JC |title=Prostatitis: evolving management strategies |journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=737–51 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10584615 |doi= 10.1016/S0094-0143(05)70215-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pmid10374787"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Alexander R, Anderson R, Krieger J, Moon T, Neal D, Schaeffer A, Shoskes D |title=[Prostatitis unplugged? Prostatic massage revisited.] |journal=Tech Urol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10374787 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"/&gt; In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"/&gt;

The practice is still used in some parts of China.&lt;ref name="pmid18597833"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Liu L, Xie HW, Ginsberg DA |title=Chinese urologists' practice patterns of diagnosing and treating chronic prostatitis: a questionnaire survey |journal=Urology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=548–51 |year=2008 |pmid=18597833 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2008.03.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences:  periprostatic [[hemorrhage]],&lt;ref name="pmid14655640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buse S, Warzinek T, Hobi C, Ackerman D |title=[Prostate massage with unwanted consequences.

===Electroejaculation===
[[Electroejaculation]] is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in [[animal husbandry]] for the purpose of [[semen collection|collecting semen samples]] for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of [[anejaculation]].&lt;ref name="human-electroej"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |title=Electroejaculation |accessdate=2014-10-24 |publisher=Cornell Urology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510030803/https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.

==As a sexual practice==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===General===
Prostate massage is also used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasms through [[prostate]] stimulation alone.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple Orgasms in Men—What We Know So Far|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293195654|last1=Wibowo|first1=Erik|last2=Wassersug|first2=Richard J.|year=2016|journal=Sexual Medicine Reviews|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.sxmr.2015.12.004|pmid=27872023|pages=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive [[anal intercourse]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce a stronger, more powerful, and "deeper" orgasm than solely penile stimulation, described by some men as more widespread, intense, and enduring, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Lewin, Leap"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ellen Lewin, William Leap, William L. Leap|title=Out in Theory: The Emergence of Lesbian and Gay Anthropology|isbn =978-0252070761|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2002|pages=215–216|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S02nNWBC3bMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostate massage may also be a sexual practice in couples' sexual lives, although not as common. The availability of equipment and products for prostate massage can encourage people to try it. Many couples, though, do not purchase such devices but use a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation to enhance the man's orgasm. The finger or the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged. The main problem in using the finger is that it may be too short to reach the prostate gland. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.

There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is very important to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to evacuate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.&lt;ref name="Ask Alice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate |title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
A ''prostate massager'' is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via [[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive [[massage]], or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.

Prostate massage equipment ranges from [[dildo]]s to [[butt plug]]s and [[G-Spot vibrator]]s.  When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as "prostate toys", "prostate [[sex toys]]", and "anal toys". These prostate massagers are inserted into the [[rectum]] through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during [[foreplay]] by many couples.

Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject's personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and 'lost' inside the rectum.

Some men prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, can be inserted freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as [[masturbation]]. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate.  Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Helix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|title=Aneros Helix|accessdate=2010-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401063732/http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|archivedate=1 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum.  While many massagers rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.

A G-spot vibrator can be used as a prostate massager as long as it is handled carefully and is provided with a safety base that will not allow it to be lost in the rectum. Vibrators for prostate stimulation usually have a pronounced curve at the end.

'''Qinpu''' ({{zh|t=「琴譜」}}) are [[tablature]] [[Sheet music|score]] collections for the Chinese musical instrument, the [[guqin]]. 

==What are qinpu?==
Qinpu are collections of tablatures of music for the guqin. In the past, music was passed on from teacher to student. Only recently has tablature been written down, often to preserve music or as a reference book. Tablature comes in form of individual and collections. Collections often have additional material attached to them, like explanation of fingering, qin lore, music theory, etc.

===Different types of qinpu===
There are several different types of qinpu one can obtain: original editions, photographic reprint, [[lithographic]] facsimiles and modern reset editions.

'''Original editions''' are qinpu printed at the original time of publication, or re-issues during the past. These are mostly kept in libraries and private collections. Since they are original, they tend to be fragile.

'''Photographic reprints''' is basically a scan of the original qinpu and reduced size reprint in modern binding. The most famous is the ''Qinqu Jicheng''.

'''Lithographic facsimiles''' are becoming more popular. The original qinpu is scanned, then it is lithographically printed on xuan paper. They are bound in [[traditional Chinese book binding]] method. 

'''Modern reset editions''' appeared after 2005. These have modern typographic elements and are often reset using more recent editions or handcopies of original qinpu.

The '''RETScreen Clean Energy Management Software''' (usually shortened to '''RETScreen''') is a software package developed by the Government of Canada. RETScreen Expert was highlighted at the 2016 [[Clean Energy Ministerial]] held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?crtr.sj1D=&amp;crtr.mnthndVl=9&amp;mthd=advSrch&amp;crtr.dpt1D=6683&amp;nid=1079429&amp;crtr.lc1D=&amp;crtr.tp1D=&amp;crtr.yrStrtVl=2014&amp;crtr.kw=&amp;crtr.dyStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.aud1D=&amp;crtr.mnthStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.page=3&amp;crtr.yrndVl=2020&amp;crtr.dyndVl=4 |title=Canada, Mexico and the United States Show Progress on North American Energy Collaboration |website=News.gc.ca |date=2016-06-03 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RETScreen Expert''' is the current version of the software and was released to the public on September 19, 2016. The software allows for the comprehensive identification, assessment and optimization of the technical and financial viability of potential renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; as well as the measurement and verification of the actual performance of facilities and the identification of energy savings/production opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX8JN0xkq5A |format=Video |author=Clean Energy Solutions Center |title=Financial Analysis with RETScreen |website=Youtube.com |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Viewer mode" in RETScreen Expert is free and permits access to all of the functionality of the software. Unlike past versions of RETScreen, however, a new "Professional mode" (which allows users to save, print, etc.) is now available on an annual subscription basis. 

RETScreen Suite, comprising RETScreen 4 and RETScreen Plus, is the previous version of the RETScreen software. RETScreen Suite includes cogeneration and off-grid analysis capabilities.

Unlike RETScreen Suite, RETScreen Expert is one integrated software platform; utilizes detailed and comprehensive archetypes for assessing projects; and includes portfolio analysis capability. RETScreen Expert integrates a number of databases to assist the user, including a global database of climatic conditions obtained from 6,700 ground-based stations and NASA satellite data; benchmark database; cost database; project database; hydrology database and product database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">[[File:Henri de Saint-simon portrait.jpg|thumb|Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]]

'''Saint-Simonianism''' was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825).

Saint-Simon's ideas, expressed largely through a succession of journals such as ''l'Industrie'' (1816), ''La politique'' (1818) and ''L'Organisateur'' (1819–20)&lt;ref name="Hewett, 2008"&gt;Hewett, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  focused on the perception that growth in [[industrialization]] and scientific discovery would have profound changes on society. He believed that society would restructure itself by abandoning traditional ideas of temporal and spiritual power, an evolution that would lead, inevitably, to a productive society based on and benefiting from, a " ... union of men engaged in useful work"; the basis of "true equality".&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Simon, quoted in Leopold, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint-Simon's writings==
Saint-Simon's earliest publications, such as his ''Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIXe siècle (Introduction to scientific discoveries of the 19th century)'' (1803) and his ''Mémoire sur la science de l'homme (Notes on the study of man)'' (1813), (the latter of which is a eulogy to [[Napoleon]]), demonstrate his faith in science as a means to regenerate society. In his 1814 essay ''De la réorganisation de la société européenne (On the reorganisation of European society)'', written in collaboration with his then secretary [[Augustin Thierry]], Saint-Simon  seems to have foreseen the [[European Union]], expecting however that [[England]] would take the lead in forming a continent sharing the same laws and institutions.&lt;ref name="Goyau 1912"&gt;Goyau (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;

For his last decade Saint-Simon concentrated on themes of [[political economy]]. Together with [[Auguste Comte]], (then only a teenager), Saint-Simon projected a society bypassing the changes of the French Revolution, in which science and industry would take the moral and temporal power of medieval [[theocracy]].&lt;ref name="Goyau 1912"/&gt;

In his last work however, ''Le Nouveau Christianisme (The New Christianity)'' (1825), Saint-Simon reverted to more traditional ideas of renewing society through [[Christian]] [[The New Commandment|brotherly love]]. He died shortly after its publication.&lt;ref name="Hewett, 2008"/&gt;

==The arts==
In his last years and in the period after his death, Saint-Simon's ideas, which gave prominence to art as a prized aspect of work, interested numerous artists and musicians, amongst them [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Félicien David]] (who wrote a number of hymns for the movement) &lt;ref&gt;Locke, Ralph P.. "Music, Musicians, and the Saint-Simonians", Chicago: Univ of Chicago Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0226489027}} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Liszt]]. For a brief period, the historian and writer [[Léon Halévy]] acted as secretary to the philosopher.

==The movement after Saint-Simon's death==
Following Saint-Simon's death in 1825, his followers began to differ as to how to promulgate his ideas. A 'charismatic' faction, led by [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]], purchased the newspaper ''[[Le Globe]]'' as their official organ, and formed an increasingly religiously-minded ritualistic group based on a community founded at [[Ménilmontant]], before being banned by the authorities in 1832. Following this some of Enfantin's followers visited [[Constantinople]] and then [[Egypt]] and influenced the creation of the [[Suez Canal]] in search of [[messiah|Messianic]] revelations, and the formal Saint-Simonian movement expired.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=31-37|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others who had been associated with the group and were not so followers of Enfantin, (such as [[Olinde Rodrigues]] and [[Gustave d'Eichthal]]) developed Saint-Simonian notions practically and involved themselves in the development of the French economy, founding a number of leading concerns including the [[Suez Canal]] Company and the bank [[Crédit Mobilier]].&lt;ref name="Leopold, 1998"&gt;Leopold, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been noted that Saint-Simonian ideas exerted a significant influence on new religious movements such as [[Spiritualism]] and [[Occultism]] since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The major focus of the journal is publishing important original scientific research and research reviews, but ''Science'' also publishes science-related news, opinions on [[science policy]] and other matters of interest to scientists and others who are concerned with the wide implications of science and technology. Unlike most [[scientific journals]], which focus on a specific field, ''Science'' and its rival ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' cover the full range of [[List of academic disciplines#Natural sciences|scientific disciplines]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', ''Science''{{'}}s 2015 [[impact factor]] was 34.661.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Science |title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the journal of the AAAS, membership in the AAAS is not required to publish in ''Science''. Papers are accepted from authors around the world. Competition to publish in ''Science'' is very intense, as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors. Fewer than 7% of articles submitted are accepted for publication.

''Science'' is based in Washington, D.C., United States, with a second office in [[Cambridge]], England.

Origins: 1848–1899]", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1894, ''Science'' was again in financial difficulty and was sold to psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]] for $500.{{fact|date=May 2018}} 

In an agreement worked out by Cattell and AAAS secretary [[Leland Ossian Howard|Leland O. Howard]], ''Science'' became the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS, "[http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/science2.php 150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS. AAAS and Science: 1900–1940]", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century important articles published in ''Science'' included papers on [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] [[genetics]] by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], [[gravitational lens]]ing by [[Albert Einstein]], and [[spiral nebulae]] by [[Edwin Hubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/science5.php |title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS.

After Cattell's death in 1944, the journal lacked a consistent editorial presence until Graham DuShane became editor in 1956. In 1958, under DuShane's leadership, ''Science'' absorbed ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'', thus increasing the journal's circulation by over 60% from 38,000 to more than 61,000.&lt;ref name=maturing3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/maturing3.php |title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS.

Under Abelson the efficiency of the review process was improved and the publication practices were brought up to date.&lt;ref name=maturing3/&gt; During this time, papers on the [[Apollo program]] missions and some of the earliest reports on AIDS were published.&lt;ref name=change3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/change3.php |title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS.

In February 2001, draft results of the [[human genome]] were simultaneously published by ''Nature'' and ''Science'' with ''Science'' publishing the [[Celera Corporation|Celera Genomics]] paper and ''Nature'' publishing the publicly funded [[Human Genome Project]]. In 2007 ''Science ''(together with [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']]) received the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/ing/04/premiados/trayectorias/trayectoria820.html Journal Science]. Fundacionprincipedeasturias.org. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]], chief executive officer of the AAAS and executive publisher of ''Science'', stated that the journal was becoming increasingly international: "[I]nternationally co-authored papers are now the norm—they represent almost 60 percent of the papers. In 1992, it was slightly less than 20 percent."&lt;ref name="Science and Diplomacy."&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/scientific-drivers-for-diplomacy |journal=Science and Diplomacy |date=June 29, 2015 |title=Scientific Drivers for Diplomacy |first=Rush |last=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10493">The term '''she-tragedy''', also known as "''pathetic tragedy''"&lt;ref&gt;The Ravishing Restoration: Aphra Behn, Violence, and Comedy  By Ann Marie Stewart&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a vogue in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for tragic plays focused on the sufferings of a woman, sometimes innocent and virtuous but often a woman who has committed some sort of sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canfield|first=J. Douglas|title=The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Early Eighteenth-Century Drama|year=2001|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551112701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent she-tragedies include [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'' (1680), [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]]' ''[[Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen]]'' (1682), [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[The Fatal Marriage]]'' (1694) and [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703) and ''[[Lady Jane Grey (play)|Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term "she-tragedy," in 1714.

== Overview ==
When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated [[heroic drama]] which celebrated powerful, aggressively [[masculinity|masculine]] heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from [[heroic]] to [[pathos|pathetic]] tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of [[Elizabeth Barry]] in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's ''The Orphan'', she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.

The realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Elizabeth|title='The First English Actresses: Women and Drama 1660&amp;ndash;1700'|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42210-9|pages=19, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of She-tragedy ==
She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Susan J. (2001). A Companion to Restoration Drama. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-21923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her 
"''Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul;
But n the morning when you call me to you
As by your bed I stand and tell you stories,
I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, 
It makes me blush, they are so very white''." (1.221-25)
Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Political Propaganda ==
While she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe's ''Jane Grey'' the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects' liberties.

== Actresses and Royal Support ==
One reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne.  As part of the English Civil War, the previous monarch, Charles II's father Charles I, was executed, sending his sons into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile abroad in France, living as part of the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, which Charles II would have been exposed to. As a result, when he returned to England, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.

In addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women's roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who "took offence" &lt;ref&gt;The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660-1700&lt;/ref&gt; at men cross-dressing to play women, something that goes against a verse from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of "breeches roles" developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men's clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while part of elaborate  plot, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women as men's clothing did not disguise the body's form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.

== Women In Tragedy ==
The new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband [[William III of England|William III]] was on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and the publication of ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright "master of pathos" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in ''The Orphan'', the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.

'''Social theories''' are analytical frameworks, or paradigms, that are used to study and interpret social phenomena.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Seidman, S., 2016. Contested knowledge: Social theory today. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; A tool used by [[social scientists]], social theories relate to historical debates over the validity and reliability of different methodologies (e.g. [[positivism]] and [[antipositivism]]), the primacy of either [[structure or agency]], as well as the relationship between contingency and necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt;  Social theory in an informal nature, or authorship based outside of academic social and political science, may be referred to as "[[social criticism]]" or "[[social commentary]]", or "cultural criticism" and may be associated both with formal [[cultural studies|cultural]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] scholarship, as well as other non-academic or journalistic forms of writing.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

'''Social theory''' by definition is used to make distinctions and generalizations among different types of societies, and to analyze [[modernity]] as it has emerged in the past few centuries.&lt;ref name=Callinicos&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Theory: A Historical Introduction |author=Callinicos, A. |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Social theory as it is recognized today emerged in the 20th century as a distinct discipline, and was largely equated with an attitude of critical thinking and the desire for knowledge through ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' methods of discovery, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' methods of tradition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  

'''Social thought''' provides general theories to explain actions and behavior of society as a whole, encompassing [[sociology|sociological]], [[political science|political]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideas. Classical social theory has generally been presented from a perspective of [[Western philosophy]], and often regarded as [[Eurocentric]].{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}

==History==

===Ancient===
[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) envisaged a just society that went beyond his contemporary society of the [[Warring States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|author2=Plummer, Ken |year=2005|title=Sociology.

In the West, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] (354–430) was concerned exclusively with the idea of the ''just society''. St. Augustine describes late [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] society through a lens of hatred and contempt for what he saw as false [[deity|Gods]], and in reaction theorized [[City of God (book)|City of God]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), did not see a distinction between politics and society.  The concept of society did not come until  the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]].  The term, ''société'', was probably first used as key concept by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in discussion of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heilbron, Johan |title=The Rise of Social Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the enlightenment, social theory took largely [[narrative]] and [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] form. It was expressed as stories and fables, and it may be assumed the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers and religious teachers were the precursors to social theory proper.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Sociology in medieval Islam|Muqaddimah|Asabiyyah}}

There is evidence of [[early Muslim sociology]] from the 14th century: in [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (later translated as ''Prolegomena'' in [[Latin]]), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]], was the first to advance [[social philosophy]] and [[social science]] in formulating theories of [[Structural cohesion|social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. [[Ibn Khaldun]] is thus considered by many to be the forerunner of sociology.&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akhtar&gt;Dr. S. W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun|Khaldun's]] treatise described in ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' ''(Introduction to History)'', published in 1377, two types of societies: (1) the city or [[town]]-dweller and (2) the mobile, [[nomadic]] societies.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== European social thought ===
[[Modernity]] arose during the Enlightenment period, with the emergence of the [[world economy]] and exchange among diverse societies, bringing sweeping changes and new challenges for society.  Many [[France|French]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] intellectuals and [[philosopher]]s embraced the idea of progress and ideas of modernity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Enlightenment period was marked by the idea was that with new [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] challenging the traditional way of thinking, scientists were required to find new normativity. This process allowed [[scientific knowledge]] and society to [[Social progress|progress]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}  French thought during this period focused on [[moral]] critique and criticisms of the [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|15}} These ideas did not draw on ideas of the past from classical thinkers, nor involved following [[religion|religious]] teachings and authority of the [[monarch]]. 

A common factor among the classical theories was the agreement that the [[history of humanity]] is pursuing a fixed path. They differed on where that path would lead: [[social progress]], [[technological progress]], decline or even fall. Social cycle theorists were skeptical of the Western achievements and technological progress, but argued that progress is an illusion of the ups and downs of the historical cycles. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The classical approach has been criticized by many modern sociologists and theorists; among them [[Karl Popper]], [[Robert Nisbet]], [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].

The 19th century brought questions involving [[social order]].  The [[French Revolution]] freed French society of control by the monarchy, with no effective means of maintaining social order until [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] came to power.  Three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the [[social evolutionism]] theory (of which [[Social Darwinism]] forms a part), the [[social cycle theory]], and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[historical materialism]] theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

19th-century classical social theory has been expanded upon to create newer, contemporary social theories such as [[Multilineal evolution|multilineal theories of evolution]] ([[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernization]], [[theory of post-industrial society]]) and various strains of [[Neo-Marxism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social theory became closely related to academic [[sociology]], and other related studies such as [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[social work]] branched out into their own disciplines. Subjects like "[[philosophy of history]]" and other multi-disciplinary subject matter became part of social theory as taught under sociology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A revival of discussion free of disciplines began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt Institute for Social Research]] is a historical example. The [[Committee on Social Thought]] at the [[University of Chicago]] followed in the 1940s. In the 1970s, programs in [[Social and Political Thought]] were established at [[University of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[York University|York]]. Others followed, with emphases and structures, such as [[Social Theory and History]] ([[University of California, Davis]]). [[Cultural Studies]] programs extended the concerns of social theory into the domain of [[culture]] and thus [[anthropology]]. A chair and undergraduate program in social theory was established at the [[University of Melbourne]]. Social theory at present seems to be gaining acceptance as a classical academic discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Classical social theory ====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Adam Ferguson]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], among others, were the first to study society as distinct from political institutions and processes.  In the nineteenth century, the [[scientific method]] was introduced into study of society, which was a significant advance leading to development of [[sociology]] as a [[discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the 18th century, the pre-classical period of social theories developed a new form that provides the basic ideas for social theory, such as: [[evolution]], [[philosophy of history]], social life and [[social contract]], public and general will, competition in social space, [[organistic pattern]] for social description.
[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], in ''The Spirit of Laws'', which established that social elements influence human nature, was possibly the first to suggest a universal explanation for [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Althusser, L. |title=Politics and History |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montesquieu included changes in [[mores]] and manners as part of his explanation of political and historic events.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

Philosophers, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Denis Diderot]], developed new social ideas during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period that were based on [[reason]] and methods of scientific inquiry.  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in this time played a significant role in social theory. He revealed the origin of [[Social inequality|inequality]], analyzed the social contract (and social compact) that forms [[social integration]] and defined the social sphere or [[civil society]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also emphasized that man has the liberty to change his world, an assertion that made it possible to program and change society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Adam Smith]] addressed the question of whether vast inequalities of wealth represented progress.  He explained that the wealthy often demand [[convenience]], employing numerous others to carry out [[employment|labor]] to meet their demands.{{Citation needed| date= March 2018}}  Smith argued that this allows wealth to be redistributed among inhabitants, and for all to share in progress of society.  Smith explained that social forces could regulate the [[market economy]] with social objectivity and without need for [[government]] intervention.  Smith regarded the [[division of labor]] as an important factor for economic progress.  [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] suggested that improved status of [[women]] was important for progress of society.  Millar also advocated for [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]], suggesting that personal [[liberty]] makes people more industrious, ambitious, and [[productivity|productive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meek, Rodney L. |title=Economics and Ideology and Other Essays |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "modern" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology. [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), known as the "father of sociology" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/comte/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 October 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the groundwork for [[positivism]] – as well as [[structural functionalism]] and [[social evolutionism]]. [[Karl Marx]] rejected Comtean positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognised as a founding figure of sociology posthumously. At the turn of the 20th century, the first of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social scientific thought in particular; Durkheimian [[sociological positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]], Marxist historical materialism and [[conflict theory]], and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] critique.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Another early modern theorist, [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]". [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) and [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] argued that "history goes in cycles," and presented the [[social cycle theory]] to illustrate their point. [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1855–1936) made ''community'' and ''society'' (''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'', 1887) the special topics of the new science of "sociology", both of them based on different modes of [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[social actor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The 19th century pioneers of social theory and sociology, like Saint-Simon, Comte, Marx, [[John Stuart Mill]] or Spencer, never held university posts and they were broadly regarded as philosophers. Emile Durkheim endeavoured to formally established academic sociology, and did so at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, he published ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Post-modern social theory====
{{Further information|post-modern feminism|postmodernism|post-structuralism}}
The term "postmodernism" was brought into social theory in 1971 by the Arab American Theorist [[Ihab Hassan]] in his book: ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature''. In 1979 [[Jean-François Lyotard]] wrote a short but influential work ''[[The Postmodern Condition|The Postmodern Condition: A report on knowledge]]''. [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Roland Barthes]] were influential in the 1970s in developing postmodern theory.

Scholars most commonly hold ''[[postmodernism]]'' to be a movement of ideas arising from, but also critical of elements of [[modernism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The wide range of uses of this term resulted in different elements of modernity are chosen as being continuous. Each of the different uses is rooted in some argument about the nature of knowledge, known in philosophy as [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allan, H Turnner|first=Kenneth, Jonathan|last2=Turner|first2=Jonathan H.|year=2000|title=A formalization of postmodern theory|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=43|issue=3|pages=363|doi=10.2307/1389533|issn=0731-1214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who use the term are arguing that either there is something fundamentally different about the transmission of meaning, or that modernism has fundamental flaws in its system of knowledge. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The argument for the necessity of the term states that economic and technological conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society. {{Citation needed| date= March 2018}} These ideas are [[simulacra]], and only inter-referential representations and copies of each other, with no real original, stable or objective source for [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in communication, [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=L Arxer|first=Steven|year=2008|title=Addressing postmodern concerns on the border: globalization, the nation-state, hybridity, and social change|journal=Tamara Journal of Critical Organisation Inquiry|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=179|issn=1532-5555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization is cited as one force which has decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society, lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication, or intellectual production. The postmodern view is that inter-subjective knowledge, and not objective knowledge, is the dominant form of [[discourse]]. The ubiquity of copies and dissemination alters the relationship between reader and what is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

Not all people who use the term postmodern or postmodernism see these developments as positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrov|first=Igor|year=2003|title=Globalization as a Postmodern Phenomenon|journal=International Affairs|volume=49|issue=6|pages=127|issn=0130-9641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of the term argue that their ideals have arisen as the result of particular economic and social conditions, including "[[late capitalism]]", the growth of [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] media, and that such conditions have pushed society into a new [[historical period]].

====Today====
In the past few decades, in response to postmodern critiques, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} social theory has begun to stress free will, individual choice, subjective reasoning, and the importance of unpredictable events in place of [[determinism|deterministic necessity]]. [[Rational choice theory]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[False necessity]] are examples of more recent developments. A view among contemporary sociologists is that there are no great unifying 'laws of history', but rather smaller, more specific, and more complex laws that govern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] recently attempted to revise classical social theory by exploring how things fit together, rather than to provide an all encompassing single explanation of a universal reality. He begins by recognizing the key insight of classical social theory of society as an artifact, and then by discarding the law-like characteristics forcibly attached to it. Unger argues that classical social theory was born proclaiming that society is made and imagined, and not the expression of an underlying natural order, but at the same time its capacity was checked by the equally prevalent ambition to create law-like explanations of history and social development. The [[human sciences]] that developed claimed to identify a small number of possible types of social organization that coexisted or succeeded one another through inescapable developmental tendencies or deep-seated economic organization or psychological constraints. [[Marxism]] is the star example.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Theory: Its situation and its task|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Unger, calling his efforts "super-theory", has thus sought to develop a comprehensive view of history and society. Unger does so without subsuming deep structure analysis under an indivisible and repeatable type of social organization or with recourse to law-like constraints and tendencies.&lt;ref name="Unger" /&gt;{{rp|165}} His articulation of such a theory is in ''False Necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy,'' where he uses deep-logic practice to theorize human social activity through anti-necessitarian analysis.

Unger begins by formulating the theory of false necessity, which claims that social worlds are the artifact of human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that societies must adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. We are free to choose and to create the forms and the paths that our societies will take. However, this does not give license to absolute contingency. Unger finds that there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring about certain institutional forms—liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, which Unger calls [[formative context]]. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] make change possible. Unger calls this empowerment [[negative capability]]. However, Unger adds that these outcomes are always reliant on the forms from which they spring. The new world is built upon the existing one.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book|title=False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition|last=Unger|first=Roberto|publisher=Verso|year=2004|isbn=978-1-85984-331-4|location=London|pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==

===Chicago school===
{{Main|Chicago School (sociology)}}
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed in the 1920s, through the work of [[Albion Woodbury Small]], [[W. I. Thomas]], [[Ernest W. Burgess]], [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ellsworth Faris]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and other sociologists at the [[University of Chicago]].  The Chicago school focused on patterns and arrangement of social phenomenon across [[time]] and [[Location (geography)|place]], and within context of other social variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abbott, Andrew|year=1997|title=Of Time and Space: The Contemporary Relevance of the Chicago School|journal=Social Forces|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|volume=75|issue=4|pages=1149–82|doi=10.2307/2580667|jstor=2580667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory===

[[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Critical theorists]] rejected the "objective", scientific approach, and sought to frame theories within [[ideology|ideologies]] of [[human freedom]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Marxism===
{{Main|Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] wrote and theorized about the importance of [[political economy]] on society, and focused on the "material conditions" of life.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|4}} His theories centered around capitalism and its affect on class-struggle between the  [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=The German Ideology.

==In academic practices==
Social theory seeks to question why humans inhabit the world the way they do, and how that came to be by looking at power relations, social structures, and  social norms,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56608295|title=Modern social theory : an introduction|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Harrington, Austin, 1970-|isbn=9780199255702|location=Oxford|oclc=56608295}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also examining how humans relate to each other and the society they find themselves in, how this has changed over time and in different cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/232358185|title=Contemporary social theory : an introduction|last=1964-|first=Elliott, Anthony,|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415386333|location=London|oclc=232358185}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the tools used to measure those things. Social theory looks to [[interdisciplinarity]], combining knowledge from multiple academic disciplines in order to enlighten these complex issues,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and can draw on ideas from fields as diverse as [[anthropology]] and [[media studies]]. 

Social theory guides scientific inquiry by promoting scientists to think about which topics are suitable for investigation and how they should measure them. Selecting or creating appropriate theory for use in examining an issue is an important skill for any researcher. Important distinctions: a ''theoretical orientation'' (or [[paradigm]]) is a worldview, the lens through which one organizes experience (i.e. thinking of human interaction in terms of power or exchange). A ''theory'' is an attempt to explain and predict behavior in particular contexts. A theoretical orientation cannot be proven or disproven; a theory can. 

Having a theoretical orientation that sees the world in terms of power and control, one could create a theory about violent human behavior which includes specific causal statements (e.g. being the victim of physical abuse leads to psychological problems). This could lead to a [[hypothesis]] (prediction) about what one expects to see in a particular sample, e.g. "a battered child will grow up to be shy or violent". One can then test the hypothesis by looking to see if it is consistent with [[data]]. One might, for instance, review hospital records to find children who were abused, then track them down and administer a personality test to see if they show signs of being violent or shy. The selection of an appropriate (i.e. useful) theoretical orientation within which to develop a potentially helpful theory is the bedrock of social science.

=== Example of questions posed by social theorists ===
Philosophical questions addressed by social thinkers often centered around [[modernity]], including:
* Can human reason make sense of the social world and shape it for the better?
* Did the development of modern societies, with vast inequalities in wealth among citizens, constitute progress?
* How do particular government interventions and regulations impact natural social processes?
* Should the economy/market be regulated or not?
Other issues relating to modernity that were addressed by social thinkers include [[Atomism (social)|social atomization]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[loneliness]], [[social disorganization]], and [[secularization]].

A '''sympagic''' environment is one where water exists mostly as a solid, [[ice]], such as a [[polar ice cap]] or [[glacier]]. Solid [[sea ice]] is permeated with channels filled with salty brine. These briny channels and the sea ice itself have its ecology, referred to as "sympagic ecology".

Residents of [[temperate]] or [[tropical]] climates often assume, mistakenly, that ice and snow are devoid of life. In fact, a number of varieties of [[algae]] such as [[diatom]]s engage in [[photosynthesis]] in [[arctic]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]] regions of Earth. Other energy sources include Aeolian [[dust]] and [[pollen]] swept in from other regions. These ecosystems also include [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]], as well as [[animal]]s like [[Platyhelminthes|flatworms]] and [[crustacean]]s.  A number of sympagic worm species are commonly called [[ice worm]]s.

Additionally, the ocean has abundant [[plankton]], and prolific [[algal bloom]]s occur in the polar regions each summer as well as in high mountain lakes, bringing nutrients to those parts of the ice in contact with the water.

In the spring, [[krill]] can scrape off the green lawn of [[ice algae]] from the underside of the ''pack ice.''

==Style==

The book uses informal language and quotations extensively to illustrate the points the author makes. These quotations are from males and females, of a broad age range, that the author has interviewed during his research or who sent letters to him after publication of previous editions of the book.

It is illustrated throughout with realistic body drawings. It also uses comic-like drawings to maintain a light-hearted approach, such as a drawing of a vagina and a penis, both with eyes, mouth, nose, hands and feet, having a dialogue.

* Oprah Magazine reports  ″You've never read a manual as warm, friendly, liberating, thorough, and potentially sex-life-changing as the Guide to Getting It On!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/relationships/O-Talks-to-the-Guide-to-Getting-It-On-Author-Paul-Joannides/1#ixzz2LCBb0VY0 Oprah Magazine Interview with Paul Joannides]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perry Tsai, Co-director American Medical Student Association Sexual Health Scholars Program (AMSA SHSP) “Very few medical schools are teaching about the importance of sexual pleasure, so doctors are not prepared to care for this aspect of their patients’ health and well-being. We use the ''Guide to Getting It On'' to help our scholars gain a more complete understanding of sexuality and to help them promote the sexual health of their patients and peers.”
