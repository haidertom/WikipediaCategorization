In [[civil engineering|engineering]], '''abutment''' refers to the [[Bridge#Structure type|substructure]] at the ends of a bridge [[Span (architecture)|span]] or [[dam]] whereon the structure's [[Bridge#Structure type|superstructure]] rests or contacts.&lt;ref name=USBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary - "Abutment"|url=http://www.usbr.gov/library/glossary/|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-span [[bridge]]s have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge, as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen [[cut and fill|fill]] of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require [[pier (architecture)|piers]] to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Abbett| first =Robert W.| authorlink =| title =American Civil Engineering Practice| publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons| series =| volume =III| edition =| year =1957| location =New York| pages =26-22&amp;26-32| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dam abutments are generally either side of a valley or gorge but may be artificial in order to support arch dams such as [[Kurobe Dam]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=USBR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=関西電力　黒部川第四発電所 (Kurobe Kansaidenryoku Fourth plant)|url=http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/toyama/kuro4/kuro4.html|publisher=Suiryoku.com|accessdate=24 January 2015|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an [[arch]],&lt;ref name=beall1&gt;{{cite book|last=Beall|first=Christine|title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-004223-3|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The [[impost (architecture)|impost]] or [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] of a column in classical architecture may also serve as an abutment to an arch.

The word derives from the verb "[[Wiktionary: abut|abut]]", meaning to "touch by means of a mutual border".

== Use in engineering ==

An abutment may be used for the following:
* To transfer loads from a superstructure to its [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] elements
* To resist and/or transfer self weight, lateral loads (such as the earth pressure) and wind loads
* To support one end of an approach [[Concrete slab|slab]]
* to maintain a balance in between the  vertical and horizontal force components of an arch bridge.

==Types==

Types of abutments include:
* Gravity abutment, resists horizontal earth pressure with its own dead weight
* U abutment, U-shaped gravity abutment
* Cantilever abutment, cantilever retaining wall designed for large vertical loads
* Full height abutment, cantilever abutment that extends from the underpass grade line to the grade line of the overpass roadway
* Stub abutment, short abutments at the top of an embankment or slope, usually supported on piles
* Semi-stub abutment, size between full height and stub abutment
* Counterfort abutment, similar to counterfort retaining walls
* Spill-through abutment, vertical buttresses with open spaces between them
* MSE systems, "reinforced earth" system: modular units with metallic reinforcement
* Pile bent abutment, similar to spill-through abutment

{{Anthropology |types}}
'''Archaeology''', or '''archeology''',&lt;ref name="Society for American Archaeology"/&gt; is the study of human activity through the recovery and [[analysis]] of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Sinclair A | year = 2016 | title = The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004–2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | journal = Internet Archaeology | volume =  | issue = 42| page =  | doi=10.11141/ia.42.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America archaeology is a sub-field of [[anthropology]],&lt;ref name="Haviland_et_al_2005"/&gt; while in Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.

Archaeologists study human [[prehistory]] and history, from the development of the first [[stone tool]]s at [[Lomekwi]] in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades. Archaeology is distinct from [[palaeontology]], the study of fossil remains. It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for whom there may be no written records to study. Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the [[Paleolithic]] until the advent of literacy in societies across the world.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt; Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.livescience.com/44448-what-is-archaeology.html|title=What Is Archaeology? {{!}} Archaeology Definition|work=Live Science|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline involves [[Archaeological survey|surveying]], [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and eventually [[Post excavation|analysis]] of data collected to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research. It draws upon [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[art history]], [[classics]], [[ethnology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[History of literature|literary history]], [[linguistics]], [[semiology]], [[textual criticism]], [[physics]], [[information science]]s, [[chemistry]], [[statistics]], [[paleoecology]], [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[paleontology]], [[paleozoology]], and [[paleobotany]].

Archaeology developed out of [[antiquarianism]] in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world. Archaeology has been used by nation-states to create particular visions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including [[maritime archaeology]], [[feminist archaeology]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with [[pseudoarchaeology]], the looting of artifacts,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://openscience.com/a-special-issue-of-open-archaeology-on-non-professional-metal-detecting/ |title=A Special Issue of Open Archaeology on Non-Professional Metal-Detecting  |first=Pablo |last=Markin |work=[[OpenScience]] |date=10 April 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.

==History==
{{main|History of archaeology}}

===Antiquarians===
{{main|Antiquarian}}
{{further|History of Chinese archaeology}}
The science of archaeology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιολογία}}, ''archaiologia'' from {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''arkhaios'', "ancient" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logia'', "[[-logy]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=archaeology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=archaeology|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the older multi-disciplinary study known as antiquarianism. Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], "We speak from facts not theory". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K. Kris|title=The History of Archaeology: How Ancient Relic Hunting Became Science|work=ThoughtCo|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, philosophical interest in the remains of [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the late [[Middle Age]]. [[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.

===First excavations===
[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]
One of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626–1697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975|isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0|pages=156–57, 162–66, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations were also carried out in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.

However, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of archaeological method===
[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]
The father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754–1810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441–53&lt;/ref&gt; funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.

A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or "[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or "chronologically". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=9781905739585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that "I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details." Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].

[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]
The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].

Archaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991#5"&gt;Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33–35)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]
The purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools – [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.&lt;ref name="ncl"/&gt;

However, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].&lt;ref name="archaeological"/&gt;

Often, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.

===Theory===
{{main|Archaeological theory}}
[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]

There is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.&lt;ref name="Binford1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flannery1967"/&gt; They proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and "anthropological", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1993"/&gt; [[Christopher Tilley]],&lt;ref name="Tilley1993"/&gt; [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],&lt;ref name="Miller_Tilley1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller_etal1989"/&gt; and [[Ian Hodder]],&lt;ref name="Hodder1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1992"/&gt; which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.&lt;ref name="Pauketat2001"/&gt;

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[35]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].

==Methods==
[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]
An archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt;

===Remote sensing===
Before actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments—passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:

'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)
A lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.

'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''
A laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field survey===
{{main|Archaeological survey}}
[[File:Monte Albán archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]
The archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],&lt;ref name="Willey1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willey1968"/&gt; and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.&lt;ref name="Billmand_Feinman1999"/&gt;

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)&lt;ref name="Redman1974"/&gt; As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.
[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]
The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].

[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102–07|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sánchez |first=Rosalía |title=Para los arqueólogos es un ladrón, para los buscadores de tesoros un ídolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===Excavation===
{{main|Excavation (archaeology)}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavations at the 3800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]], [[Iowa]]]]
[[File:Vill excavation.jpg|thumb|upright|Archaeological excavation that discovered prehistoric caves in [[Vill]] ([[Innsbruck]]), [[Austria]]]]
[[File:Sifting for POW remains, Wake Island.jpg|thumb|right|An archaeologist sifting for [[Prisoner of war|POW]] remains on [[Wake Island]].]]

Archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and "method statement" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey.Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

===Analysis===
{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}

Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.

At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]], while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

===Computational and virtual archaeology===
{{main|Computational archaeology}}
{{main|Virtual archaeology}}
[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.&lt;ref name="virt"/&gt; [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].&lt;ref name=virt/&gt; [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. [[Data mining]] can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.

===Drones===

Archaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and weeks instead of months and years.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;{{citation|author=Reuters in Lima |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124451/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins|archivedate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drones costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013, drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta {{convert|4000|m}} above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone [[blimp]], employing open source software.&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley."&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

In September 2014 drones weighing about {{convert|5|kg|0|abbr=on}} were used for 3D mapping of the above-ground ruins of the Greek city of [[Aphrodisias]]. The data is being analysed by the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hudson|first1=Hal|title=Air-chaeological drones search for ancient treasures|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329883.900-airchaeological-drones-search-for-ancient-treasures.html#.VC1hk_ldV8E|accessdate=2 October 2014|issue=2988|publisher=New Scientist|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic sub-disciplines==
{{Main|Archaeological sub-disciplines}}

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterized by a specific method or type of material (e.g., [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], Islamic archaeology, [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[maritime archaeology]], [[landscape archaeology]], [[battlefield archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilization]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]], [[Indology]], [[Sinology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.saa.org/Default.aspx?TabId=1346|title=What is Archaeology?|last=Archaeology|first=Society for American|website=www.saa.org|language=en-US|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical archaeology===
{{Main|Historical archaeology}}

Historical archaeology is the study of cultures with some form of writing.

In [[England]], archaeologists have uncovered layouts of 14th century medieval villages, abandoned after crises such as the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name=dyer&gt;{{citation|last1=Dyer|first1=Christopher|title=Deserted Medieval Villages in the West Midlands|volume=35|number=1|date=1982|journal=Economic History Society|jstor=2595101|pp=19–34|doi=10.2307/2595101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In downtown [[New York City]], archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|African Burial Ground]].

===Ethnoarchaeology===
{{Main|Ethnoarchaeology}}

[[Ethnoarchaeology]] is the ethnographic study of living people, designed to aid in our interpretation of the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Gould1971a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould1971b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould_Yellen1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1991"/&gt; The approach first gained prominence during the processual movement of the 1960s, and continues to be a vibrant component of post-processual and other current archaeological approaches.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sillet_et_al2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott_Sillitoe2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogundele2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuznar2001"/&gt; Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on [[hunter-gatherer]] or foraging societies; today ethnoarchaeological research encompasses a much wider range of human behaviour.

===Experimental archaeology===
{{Main|Experimental archaeology}}

[[Experimental archaeology]] represents the application of the experimental method to develop more highly controlled observations of processes that create and impact the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Ascher1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez_et_al1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frison1989"/&gt; In the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological [[epistemological|epistemologies]] the experimental method gained importance. Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.

===Archaeometry===
{{Main|Archaeological science}}

[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.&lt;ref name="Glasscock_et_al1994"/&gt; Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.&lt;ref name="GIS, critique, representation and beyond"/&gt; [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.&lt;ref name="An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns"/&gt;  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

===Cultural resources management===
{{Main|Cultural resources management}}
{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}

Archaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called heritage management in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology"/&gt; CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]&lt;ref name="Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government"/&gt; has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].

In England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]&lt;ref name="Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment"/&gt; in association with [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name="English Heritage - Stonehenge &amp; the History of England: English Heritage"/&gt; In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadw]]&lt;ref name="Cadw"/&gt; and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]&lt;ref name="Built Environment"/&gt; respectively.

In France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.

The annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with "strong backs and weak minds,"&lt;ref name="Flannery1982"/&gt; has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.

==Popular views of archaeology==

[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]
[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]

Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} It is easy for the general public to hold this notion for that is what is presented to them through general media, and has been for many decades.

The majority of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a "romantic adventurist occupation".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"&gt;{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|pages=174–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than a job in the scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of "who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"/&gt; The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Copán]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as "[[pseudoarchaeology]]".&lt;ref name="Romancing the Past-Archaeology"/&gt;
Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.&lt;ref name="Denning2004"/&gt;

==Current issues and controversy==

===Public archaeology===
[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]
Motivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.&lt;ref name="Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)"/&gt; They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.

One audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal"/&gt;

Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|title=Live from Morehead City, it's Queen Anne's Revenge :: State Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=C Southerly |author2=J Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

In the UK, popular archaeology programs such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the [[Community archaeology]] framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.

Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission "to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible."&lt;ref name="The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute"/&gt;

===Pseudoarchaeology===
{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}

[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von Däniken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively Däniken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]
[[File:Adad-Nirari stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stela]] of a king named [[Adad-nirari I|Adad-Nirari]]. Object stolen from the Iraq National Museum in the looting in connection with the [[Iraq War]] of 2003.]]

[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref name="civilizations" /&gt; Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.&lt;ref name="Hodge1937" /&gt; The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721;] {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.&lt;ref name="Munson_et_al1995" /&gt;

Archaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

====Repatriation====
:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''
A new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods—some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.

The remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].

An inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.&lt;ref name="Canadian Geographic Online" /&gt;

[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.

'''Autoinducer-2''' (AI-2), a furanosyl [[borate ester|borate diester]] or tetrahydroxy furan (species dependent), is a member of a family of [[signaling molecule]]s used in [[quorum sensing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Cao | first1= Jie-Gang | last2= Meighen | first2= Edward A. | year= 1989 | title= Purification and structural identification of an autoinducer for the luminescence system of Vibrio harveyi | journal= [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] | volume= 264 | issue= 36 | pages= 21670–21676 | pmid= 2600086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AI-2 is one of only a few known [[biomolecules]] incorporating [[boron]]. First identified in the marine bacterium ''[[Vibrio harveyi]]'', AI-2 is produced and recognized by many [[Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi= 10.1016/j.molcel.2004.07.020| last1= Miller | first1= Stephen T. | last2= Xavier | first2= Karina B. | last3= Campagna | first3= Shawn R. | last4= Taga | first4= Michiko E. | last5= Semmelhack | first5= Martin F. | last6= Bassler | first6= Bonnie L. | last7= Hughson | first7= Frederick M. | year= 2004 | title= Salmonella typhimurium Recognizes a Chemically Distinct Form of the Bacterial Quorum-Sensing Signal AI-2 | journal= [[Molecular Cell]] | volume= 15 | issue= 5 | pages= 677–687 | pmid= 15350213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi= 10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165| last1= Miller | first1= M.

AI-2 is actively transported by the Lsr ABC-type transporter into the cell in [[Enterobacteriaceae]] and few other bacterial taxa (''[[Pasteurella]]'', ''[[Photorhabdus]]'', ''[[Haemophilus]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rezzonico|first1=F.|last2=Smits|first2=T.H.M.|last3=Duffy|first3=B.|title=Detection of AI-2 receptors in genomes of Enterobacteriaceae suggests a role of type-2 quorum sensing in closed ecosystems|journal=Sensors|date=2012|volume=12|pages=6645–6665|doi=10.3390/s120506645}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is phosphorylated by {{SWL|target=LsrK|type=phosphorylated_by}}. Then, Phospho-AI-2 binds the transcriptional repressor protein, LsrR, which subsequently is released from the promoter/operator region of the lsr operon – and transcription of the ''lsr'' genes is initiated. AI-2 signalling is also regulated by glucose and cAMP/CRP via the ''lsr'' operon. In the presence of glucose, low levels of cAMP/CRP result in almost no ''lsr'' operon (''lsrABCDFG'') expression. Without glucose, cAMP-CRP is needed to stimulate the ''lsr'' expression, while LsrR represses its expression in the absence of the inducer, phospho-AI-2. As AI-2 accumulates, more AI-2 is taken in via LsrABCD, phosphorylated via LsrK, and the ''lsr'' transcription is de-repressed, enabling even more AI-2 uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi= 10.1128/JB.187.6.2066-2076.2005| last1= Wang | first1= Liang | last2= Hashimoto | first2= Yoshifumi | last3= Tsao | first3= Chen-Yu | last4= Valdes | first4= James J. | last5= Bentley | first5= William E. | year= 2005 | title= Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP Receptor Protein Influence both Synthesis and Uptake of Extracellular Autoinducer 2 in Escherichia coli | journal= [[Journal of Bacteriology]] | volume= 187 | issue= 6 | pages= 2066–2076 | pmid= 15743955| pmc= 1064054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubts have been expressed regarding AI-2's status as a universal signal. Although the ''luxS'' gene, which encodes the protein responsible for AI-2 production is widespread, the latter has mainly a primary metabolic role in the recycling of [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine]], with AI-2 being a by-product of that process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diggle | first1 = S. P. | last2 = Gardner | first2 = A. | last3 = West | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Griffin | first4 = A. S. | title = Evolutionary theory of bacterial quorum sensing: when is a signal not a signal? | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 362 | issue = 1483 | pages = 1241 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2049 | pmid=17360270 | pmc=2435587}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unequivocally AI-2 related behavior was found to be restricted primarily to organisms bearing known AI-2 receptor genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rezzonico|first1=F.|last2=Duffy|first2=B.|title=Lack of genomic evidence of AI-2 receptors suggests a non-quorum sensing role for luxS in most bacteria|journal=BMC Microbiology|date=2008|volume=8|page=154|pmid=18803868|doi=10.1186/1471-2180-8-154|pmc=2561040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while it is certainly true that some bacteria respond to AI-2, it is doubtful that it is always being produced for purposes of signaling.

'''Baritosis''' is a [[benign]] type of [[pneumoconiosis]], which is caused by long-term exposure to [[barium]] dust.

Barium has a high radio-opacity and the disease may develop after few months of exposure. Extremely dense, discrete small [[opacities]] of 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, sometimes of a star-like configuration, are seen on the [[radiograph]]. Their distribution is uniform. When they are very numerous, superimposition may give the impression of confluency, but this does not seem to occur in reality. The hilar [[lymph nodes]] can be very opaque but not enlarged. After cessation of exposure, there is a gradual clearing of the [[opacities]].

==Symptoms==

*[[Cough]]
*[[Wheezing]]
*Nasal [[irritation]]

In some cases, it is [[asymptomatic]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
==Diagnosis==
The barium particles can be seen as opaque shadows on the chest [[X-ray]]s of people with baritosis.  However, being a benign condition, it neither interferes with lung function nor causes symptoms other than a mild cough.  

After exposure to barium dust ceases, the X-ray abnormalities gradually resolve.&lt;ref name="pmid1257935"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doig AT |title=Baritosis: a benign pneumoconiosis |journal=Thorax |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=30–9 |date=February 1976 |pmid=1257935 |pmc=470358 |doi= 10.1136/thx.31.1.30|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alignement Kerlescan Carnac.jpg|thumb|Stones in the ''Kerlescan'' alignments]]
The '''Carnac stones''' ([[Breton language|Breton]]: ''Steudadoù Karnag'') are an exceptionally dense collection of [[megalith]]ic sites around the village of [[Carnac]] in [[Brittany]], consisting of [[stone row|alignments]], [[dolmen]]s, [[tumulus|tumuli]] and single [[menhir]]s. More than 3,000 [[prehistoric]] [[standing stone]]s were hewn from local [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and erected by the pre-[[Celts|Celtic]] people of [[Brittany]], and form the largest such collection in the world.&lt;ref name="Menhir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menhirs.tripod.com/intro.html |title=Megaliths of Carnac: Introduction |publisher=menhirs.tripod.com |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stones are within the Breton village of [[Carnac]], but some to the east are within [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]]. The stones were erected at some stage during the [[Neolithic]] period, probably around [[33rd century BCE|3300 BCE]], but some may date to as early as 4500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/carnac-stones.htm| title=Carnac Stones, Brittany| publisher=Sacred Destinations Travel Guide| accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stones date from 4500 BCE, modern myths were formed which resulted from 1st century AD [[Roman Gaul|Roman]] and later Christian occupations. A Christian myth associated with the stones held that they were pagan soldiers in pursuit of [[Pope Cornelius]] when he turned them to stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.therecord.com/Life/Travel/article/320293 |title=TheRecord.com - Travel - Marvelling at Carnac's stones |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceholidays.co.uk/france_holidays/brittany.php |title=France Holidays, Brittany |publisher=Franceholidays.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/why-are-carnac-stones-called-megaliths |title=Why are Carnac Stones Called Megaliths? |publisher=Big Site of Amazing Facts  |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany has its own local versions of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] cycle. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a [[Roman legion]] turned to stone by [[Merlin]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In recent centuries, many of the sites have been neglected, with reports of [[dolmen]]s being used as sheep shelters, chicken sheds or even ovens.&lt;ref name="megalithic 9178"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178| publisher=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map| title=La Madeleine dolmen Burial Chamber (Dolmen)| author=TheCaptain| date=3 January 2005| accessdate=2006-05-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66aduXnp6?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178| archivedate=1 April 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more commonly, stones have been removed to make way for roads, or as [[building material]]s. The continuing management of the sites remains a controversial topic.&lt;ref name="Menhir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://megaliths.sherwoodonline.de/menhir.html |title=Megaliths of Carnac: Standing Stones / Menhirs |publisher=megaliths.sherwoodonline.de |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alignments==
[[File:Menhirs carnac.jpg|center|795px|border|Menec alignment, at the western end]]

There are three major groups of [[stone row]]s&amp;nbsp;— ''Ménec'', ''Kermario'' and ''Kerlescan''&amp;nbsp;— which may have once formed a single group, but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes.

Eleven &lt;!-- was "Twelve", my source is just the brochure from the tourist office --&gt; converging rows of menhirs stretching for {{convert|1165|by|100|m|ft|lk=on|abbr=off}}. There are what [[Alexander Thom]] considered to be the remains of [[stone circle]]s at either end. According to the tourist office there is a "[[Stone circles|cromlech]] containing 71 stone blocks" at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end. The largest stones, around {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, are at the wider, western end; the stones then become as small as {{convert|0.6|m|ftin|lk=out|abbr=off}} high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end.

===Tumuli===
There are several [[tumulus|tumuli]], mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts.

[[File:tumulus carnac.jpg|thumbnail|''Tumulus of Saint-Michel'']]
;Saint-Michel:{{Main article|Saint-Michel tumulus}}The [[tumulus]] of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000&amp;nbsp;BC and 3400&amp;nbsp;BC. At its base it is {{convert|125|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.  It required {{convert|35000|m3|cuyd}} of stone and earth.  Its function was the same as that of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]]: a tomb for the members of the ruling class.  It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php  |title=Office de Tourisme de Carnac |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-07-03 |accessdate=2009-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060703063525/http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php |archivedate = 2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was excavated in 1862 by [[René Galles]] with a series of vertical pits, digging down {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

:A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923.  The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. &lt;!-- according to tourist office info, the chapel was built in 1664, also refers to this extra reconstruction "vers 1813" --&gt;

Also known as ''Er Mané'', it is a [[chamber tomb]] {{convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. It has a dolmen at the west end, and two tombs at the east end.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; A small menhir, approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, is nearby.

===Dolmens===
[[File:Dolmen Roch-Feutet.JPG|thumb|The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet. An inscription next to every standing stone formation proclaims ownership by the state of France.]]
 
There are several [[dolmen]]s scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin.
;''Er-Roc'h-Feutet'': North, near the Chapelle de La Madeleine. Has a completely covered roof.
;''La Madeleine'' &lt;small&gt;{{coord|47.6208|N|3.0482|W|type:landmark}}&lt;/small&gt;:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178 |title=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: La Madeleine (Carnac) Burial Chamber (Dolmen) |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66aduXnp6?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large dolmen measuring {{convert|12|by|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long broken capstone.&lt;ref name="megalithic 9178"/&gt; It is named after the nearby Chapelle de La Madeleine, which is still used.
[[File:Tumulus de Kercado 2005 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Dolmen of Kercado'''. Though smaller than St. Michel, older by many centuries before 4800 BC]]
;''Kercado'': A rare dolmen still covered by its original [[cairn]]. South of the Kermario alignments, it is {{convert|25|to(-)|30|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and has a small menhir on top. Previously surrounded by a circle of small menhirs {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} out,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; the main passage is {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and leads to a large chamber where numerous artifacts were found, including axes, arrowheads, some animal and human teeth, some pearls and [[sherd]]s, and 26 beads of a unique bluish [[Nephrite]] gem. It has some [[Megalithic art]] carved on its inner surfaces in the form of serpentines and a human-sized double-axe symbol carved in the underside of its main roof slab. In ancient cultures, the axe and more precisely the [[Labrys|bi-pennis]] used to represent the lightning powers of divinity. It was constructed around 4600&amp;nbsp;BC and used for approximately 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

;''Mané Brizil''
;''Kerlescan'':A roughly rectangular mound, with only one [[Caprock|capstone]] remaining. It is aligned east-to-west, with a passage entrance to the south.&lt;ref name="tiscali kerlescan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |title=Kerlescan |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66adsjbqU?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;''Kermarquer'': On a small hill, has two separate chambers.
;''Mané-Kerioned'' (Pixies' mound or ''Grotte de Grionnec''&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;):A group of three dolmens with layout unique in Brittany,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;  once covered by a tumulus. Whereas most groups of dolmens are parallel, these are arranged in a [[horseshoe]]. The largest of the three is at the east, {{convert|11|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt;
[[File:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|thumb|right| The Crucuno dolmen]]
;''Crucuno'':A "classic" dolmen, with a {{convert|40|tonne|short ton|lk=on|adj=on}}, {{convert|7.6|m|ftin|adj=on}} tablestone resting on pillars roughly {{convert|1.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high.

[[Alexander Thom]] suggested it measured forty by thirty of his [[megalithic yard]]s.&lt;ref name="ThomThom1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Thom|author2=Archibald Stevenson Thom|title=Megalithic remains in Britain and Brittany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbTeKi00QH0C|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-858156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other formations===
[[File:QuadrilatereduManio.JPG|thumb|left|The Manio quadrilateral arrangement.]]
[[File:Carnac Geant du Manio.jpg|thumb|upright|The Manio "Giant".]]
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories.
;''Manio'' quadrilateral: An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a "tertre tumulus" with a central mound, it is {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and aligned to east of northeast. The quadrilateral is {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide to the east, but only {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide at the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/manio_quadrilateral.htm |title=Manio Quadrilateral |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66advg6GF?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/manio_quadrilateral.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir, now known as the "Giant". Over {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}  tall, it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/geant_de_manio.htm |title=Géant de Manio |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024131838/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/geant_de_manio.htm |archivedate=2007-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation and analysis==
[[File:Menec Single.JPG|thumb|left|Large upright in the ''Ménec'' alignment]]
From the 1720s increasing interest was shown in these features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/mega/megacarhis_en.htm Astonishing Heaps of Stones]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, for example, [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne|La Tour d'Auvergne]] attributed them to [[druid]]ic gatherings.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; In 1805, A. Maudet de Penhoët claimed they represented stars in the sky.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Englishmen [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[Alexander Blair (writer)|Alexander Blair]] made a detailed survey of the stones in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronalds created the first accurate drawings of many of them with his patented [[perspective machine|perspective tracing instrument]], which were printed in a book ''Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sketches_at_Carnac_Brittany_in_1834.html?id=HuA-AAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834|last=Blair and Ronalds|first=|date=1836|website=Google Books|publisher=|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miln and Le Rouzic===
The first extensive excavation was performed in the 1860s by Scottish antiquary [[James Miln]] (1819–1881), who reported that by then fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 The Independent: Bretons fight for Carnac to stay in the Stone Age] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66adqwmsr?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 |date=2012-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards 1875, Miln engaged a local boy, {{Interlanguage link multi|Zacharie Le Rouzic|fr}} (1864–1939), as his assistant, and Zacharie learnt archaeology on the job. After Miln's death, he left the results of his excavations to the town of Carnac, and the ''James Miln Museum'' was established there by his brother Robert to house the artifacts. Zacharie became the director of the Museum and, although self-taught, became an internationally recognised expert on megaliths in the region. He too left the results of his work to the town, and the museum is now named ''Le Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic''.&lt;ref name=megalithia&gt;[http://www.megalithia.com/brittany/carnac/ Carnac&amp;nbsp;— Megalithic alignments of standing stones.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museedecarnac&gt;[http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517075032/http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
[[File:Carnac Ménec alignments.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The ''Ménec'' alignments of some 1,100 stones in 11 columns.]]
In 1887, H. de Cleuziou argued for a connection between the rows of stones and the directions of sunsets at the solstices.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Among more recent studies, [[Alexander Thom]] worked with his son Archie from 1970 to 1974 to carry out a detailed survey of the Carnac alignments, and produced a series of papers on the [[Archaeoastronomy|astronomical alignments]] of the stones as well as [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] supporting his concept of the [[Megalithic Yard|megalithic yard]].&lt;ref name=megalithia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John Edwin | last=Wood | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title= Sun, Moon and Standing Stones | edition=paperback 1980 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-285089-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom's megalithic yard has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heggie|first=Douglas C.|title=Megalithic Science: Ancient Mathematics and Astronomy in North-west Europe|year=1981|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05036-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive|title=Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07814-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also general theories on the use of the stones as astronomical observatories, as has been claimed for [[Stonehenge]]. According to one such theory, the [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|massive menhir]] at nearby [[Locmariaquer]] was linked to the alignments for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="dino"&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.dinosoria.com/dolmen_menhir.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Carnac Kerlescan sheep.jpg|thumb|left|Sheep grazing around the Kerlescan alignment, part of a new management strategy.]]
The ''Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic'' is at the centre of conserving and displaying the artefacts from the area.&lt;ref name=museedecarnac/&gt;  It also contains the "world's largest collection [of] prehistoric[al] exhibits"&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; with over 6,600 prehistoric objects from 136 different sites.

The monuments themselves were listed and purchased by the State at the start of the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, and while this was successful at the time, in the middle of the century, redevelopment, changes to [[Agriculture|agricultural practices]] and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The ''Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication'' (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue starting in 1984, and subsequently set up the ‘Mission Carnac’ in 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting [[Public-access television|public access]], launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/rea/reacar_en.htm The Carnac Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the megalithic structure of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], management of the stones can be controversial. Since 1991, the main groups of stone rows have been protected from the public by fences "to help vegetation growth",&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; preventing visits except by organised tours. They are open during winter, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |title=Carnac |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCZwQLf?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When [[James Miln]] studied the stones in the 1860s, he reported that fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing, and subsequent work during the 1930s and 1980s (using bulldozers) rearranged the stones, re-erecting some, to make way for roads or other structures. In 2002, protesters invaded the site, opening the padlocks and allowing tourists free entry.&lt;ref name="ml"/&gt; In particular, the group ''Collectif Holl a gevred'' (French and Breton for "the everyone-together collective") occupied the visitor centre for the Kermario alignment, demanding an immediate stop to current management plans and local input into further plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227231719/http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, management of the site has also experimented with allowing sheep to graze among the stones, in order to keep [[gorse]] and other weeds under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |title=Menec West |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCaWx6P?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Security Studies''' ('''CSS''') is a  center at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], which focuses on Swiss and international security.&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center.html |title=About Us |website= css.ethz.ch| publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCENetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osce-network.net/members/institutions/center-for-security-studies-css-eth-zuerich/ |title=OSCE Network |website=osce-network.net| publisher= OSCE Network, OSCE Network of Think Tanks and Academic Institutions |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The center was founded by Prof. Dr. Kurt Spillmann in 1986 and has been led by Prof. Dr. Andreas Wenger since 2002. It also constitutes as part of the [[Center for Comparative and International Studies]] (CIS) along with the political science professorships at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref name=AboutUs /&gt;

The mission of the CSS is to examine the challenges surrounding security policy development and how to deal with them. It does this by performing research on security-related issues and by training researchers and practitioners. The center also includes an independent think tank, which focuses on Swiss and international security policy as well as furthering peace. Another key aim of the CSS is to serve as a link between academia, practitioners and the public on security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center/mission-statement.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |website= css.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Projects which have been supported by the CSS include the [[Parallel History Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/about/imprint/index.html |title=Imprint − Parallel History Project |website= ethz.ch |date= | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)| accessdate= 2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online project which collected together and analyzed declassified and other government documents relating to the [[Cold War]], as well as the [[International Relations and Security Network]], an online information service that provided a range of open access products and resources on [[international relations]]. While the International Relations and Security Network was closed in 2016, its extensive [[digital library]] as well as other products have been integrated into the CSS and transformed into a new project, CSS Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services.html |title=Resources | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)|website= css.ethz.ch |date= 2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Chopin- Prelude in C Minor mm.5-6 chromatic run.mid|Play}}]]

In [[music]], a '''chromatic fourth''', or '''''passus duriusculus''''',&lt;ref name="Monelle"&gt;Monelle, Raymond (2000). ''The Sense of Music: Semiotic Essays'', p.73. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05716-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[melody]] or melodic fragment spanning a [[perfect fourth]] with all or almost all [[chromatic]] [[Interval (music)|interval]]s filled in ([[chromatic line]]). The quintessential example is in [[D minor]] with the tonic and dominant notes as boundaries, {{audio|Chrom4th Example.mid|Play}}:

[[File:Chrom4th Example.png]]

The chromatic fourth was first used in the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s of the 16th Century.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Latin term itself—"harsh" or "difficult" (''duriusculus'') "step" or "passage" (''passus'')—originates in [[Christoph Bernhard]]'s 17th century ''Tractatus compositionis augmentatus'' (1648–49), where it appears to refer to repeated melodic motion by semitone creating consecutive semitones.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; The term may also relate to the ''[[pianto]]'' associated with weeping.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; In the Baroque, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used it in his choral as well as his instrumental music, in the ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', for example (the chromatic fourth is indicated by a red bracket), {{audio|Bach Example wHiLite.mid|Play}}:

[[File:Bach Example wHiLite.png|400px]]

In operas of the Baroque and Classical, the chromatic fourth was often used in the bass and for woeful arias, often being called a "[[lament bass]]". In the penultimate pages of the first movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], the  chromatic fourth appears in the cellos and basses.

[[File:Vivaldi lament bass from RV 631, Aria No. 2.png|thumb|center|400px|Lament bass from [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s motet ''"O qui coeli terraeque serenitas"'' [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 631, Aria No. 2&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Peter (1998). ''The Chromatic Fourth: During Four Centuries of Music'', p.69. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-816563-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Vivaldi lament bass from RV 631, Aria No. 2.mid|Play}}.]]

This does not mean that the chromatic fourth was always used in a sorrowful or foreboding way, or that the boundaries should always be the tonic and dominant notes. One counterexample comes from the Minuet of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Mozart)|String Quartet in G major]], [[Köchel number|K.]] 387 (the chromatic fourths are conveniently bracketed by the slurs and set apart with note-to-note dynamics changes), {{audio|K387m2 IVln.mid|Play}}:

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!-- 
WHAT??? There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger.

In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages.

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Dōjinshi===
{{Main|Dōjinshi}}

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003).

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media.

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational epidemiology''' is a multidisciplinary field that uses techniques from [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[geographic information science]] and [[public health]] to better understand issues central to [[epidemiology]] such as the spread of diseases or the effectiveness of a public health intervention.

==Introduction==
In contrast with traditional [[epidemiology]], computational epidemiology looks for patterns in unstructured sources of data, such as social media. It can be thought of as the hypothesis-generating antecedent to hypothesis-testing methods such as national surveys and randomized controlled trials.
A mathematical model is developed which describes the observed behavior of the viruses, based on the available data. Then simulations of the model are performed to understand the possible outcomes given the model used. These simulations produce as results projections which can then be used to make predictions or verify the facts and then be used to plan interventions and meters towards the control of the disease's spread.

'''[[Defeminization]] and [[masculinization]]''' are the processes that a fetus goes through to become a male. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

It has often been said by biologists that in [[sexual differentiation]] in [[mammals]], the female is the "default" developmental pathway, in the sense that elimination of any of several gene actions necessary for formation of male genitalia leads to the development of external female genitalia (though development of functional ovaries requires effective action of several less understood sex-specific genes). {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Two processes: [[defeminization]], and [[masculinization]], are involved in producing [[male]] typical morphology and behavior.  Disruption of either of these processes in males produces female-typical development. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The opposite is not true; disruption of normal sexual development in females does not lead to male-typical endpoints. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Defeminization]] involves the suppression of the development of female typical morphology (development of the [[Müllerian ducts]] into the fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]]) and behavioural predispositions.  [[Masculinization]] involves the production of male typical morphology (development of the [[Wolffian ducts]] into male reproductive structures) and behavioural predispositions.  Both defeminization and masculinization are required for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.

A brief version of the female default paradigm can be stated as follows:

#A set of specific genetic instructions must be present and a series of differentiating events mediated by hormones must occur in order for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.
##The [[Y chromosome]], [[SRY]], [[SOX9]], and SF1 genes must be present and functional.
##Functional [[Leydig cell]]s must form in the [[gonad]]s.
##The Leydig cells must be able to produce [[testosterone]].
##The target cells must have the [[hormone receptor]]s to respond to the testosterone. The target cells of the [[external genitalia]] must have functional [[5-alpha-reductase]] enzyme to convert some of the testosterone to more active [[dihydrotestosterone]].
##There is some evidence that the brain must be exposed and respond to [[androgen]]s either prenatally or early in life to produce characteristic mating behavior. This is well demonstrated in many animal species but remains mostly speculative with respect to humans.
#To a large extent, each step builds on the previous. If anything goes wrong at any of the first four steps, the subsequent pathway of development results in female anatomy and behavior.
#No [[ovary|ovarian]] organizing gene [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to SRY has been discovered. Both sexes are exposed to maternal estrogen prenatally. No hormones have yet been discovered that are necessary early in life to produce female sexual development. [[Estrogen]] seems not to be necessary until puberty for purposes of differentiation.
##The full development of male characteristics also includes personal experience throughout life, determining [[gender identity]], [[gender roles]] and [[sexual orientation]]. However, there is much debate on the balance between [[nature and nurture]] in the determination.

==History==
This paradigm dates back to the 1950s. Even stronger versions were commonly stated in the 1960s and 1970s. One version, perhaps most associated with [[John Money]], (who termed it the ''Adam principle''), held that additional steps in the cascade to male identity were the recognition by parents and doctor that the external genitalia were male, which resulted in a male [[sex assignment]], which in turn resulted in a male [[sex of rearing]] by parents and society, which in turn (coupled with the reinforcing appearance of male genitalia) resulted in a male gender identity. At least by implication, female gender identity simply required a female sex of rearing and lack of an obvious penis.

In Germany in the 1970s, [[Günter Dörner]] extrapolated the cascade to include direct testosterone effect on the brain as necessary for a male gender identity and [[sexual orientation]], proposing that [[transsexualism]] and or [[homosexuality]] in biological males could result from deficiency of prenatal or early postnatal testosterone effect on the brain.

The '''Developmental Leadership Program''' (DLP, or DLPROG) is an international research and policy initiative. The Program looks at the political processes that underpin development goals such as sustainable economic growth, political stability and inclusive social development.  In particular, DLP explores the central role of leaders, elites and coalitions in developing countries and how they can help or hinder the positive reform of institutions and policies in the public, private and civil society sectors. DLP is funded primarily by [http://aid.dfat.gov.au/makediff/Pages/default.aspx the Australian Aid Program].

==Background==

===The core aims and activities of DLP===
The core aim of DLP is to develop a clearer understanding of the political processes that support developmental change and to embed that understanding in the thinking, policies and practices of the wider development community. DLP does this by:
* Undertaking, commissioning and publishing high quality, policy-relevant research. 
* Organising international seminars and workshop sessions. 
* Providing clear policy guidance, country-level operational guidance and political analysis tools for development practitioners and policy makers.

===Central argument: politics is the key===
* At the core of DLP’s work is the recognition that politics is central to the development process.   
* Development is not just a technical challenge or a question or transferring information, skills or resources. These are important but it is also crucial that development is supported and sustained by local political agents and processes.     
* Politics is understood by DLP in very broad terms, as all of the various activities of conflict, negotiation and co-operation that occur when people with different interests, ideas and degrees of influence have to make collective decisions about rules, resources and power.  
* Politics occurs at all levels and in all sectors and organisations in society. It unfolds through formal rules and institutions but also informal norms, customs and understandings.  Politics is the key to the peaceful management of differences and disagreements, from energy policy in China and India through to the informal networks that promote women’s rights in Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Harrison, T. and Kostka, G. (2012) “Manoeuvres for a Low Carbon State: The Local Politics of Climate Change in China and India”, DLP Research Paper 22; and Tadros, M. (2011) “Working Politically Behind Red Lines: Structure and agency in a comparative study of women’s coalitions in Egypt and Jordan”, DLP Research Paper 12. http://www.dlprog.org/ftp/&lt;/ref&gt;    
* Leadership is central to politics and DLP aims to improve understanding of the role of leaders, elites and coalitions in promoting (or frustrating) inclusive political settlements, stable polities, sustainable economic growth and inclusive social development – particularly in the context of weak and fragile states.

==Organisational structure==
DLP is run by a Program Management Team. While DLP's funding comes primarily from the Australian national government, the Program is independent and autonomous.  	
As of July 2014, DLP's management team consists of:

* ''[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/government-society/marquette-heather.aspx Heather Marquette]'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Director
* ''[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/people/david-hudson David Hudson]'', Department of Political Science, University College London - Deputy Director
* ''[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/about/staff/profile?uname=croche Chris Roche]'', Institute for Human Security and Social Change, La Trobe University, Melbourne - Senior Research Partner
* ''Heather Lyne de Ver'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Program Manager

===History===
DLP has its origins in the work of the Leaders, Elites and Coalitions Research Program (LECRP), which began in 2007.  It evolved into the Leadership Program: Developmental Leaders, Elites and Coalitions (LPDLEC) in 2009 before adopting its current form.

'''EcoRV''' (pronounced "eco R five") is a type II restriction [[endonuclease]] isolated from certain strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. It has the alternative name Eco32I.

In [[molecular biology]], it is a commonly used [[restriction enzyme]]. It creates [[Sticky end/blunt end|blunt ends]]. The enzyme recognizes the palindromic 6-base DNA sequence 5'-GAT|ATC-3' and makes a cut at the vertical line. The complementary sequence is then 3'-CTA|TAG-5'. The ends are blunt and can be ligated into a blunt cloning site easily but with lower efficiency than sticky ends.

== Structure ==
The structure of this enzyme, and several mutants, in complex with the DNA sequence which it cuts has been solved by [[X-ray crystallography]].

The core of the enzyme consists of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The core is conserved in all other type II restriction endonucleases. It also has an N-terminal dimerization subdomain formed by a short α-helix, a two-stranded antiparallel -sheet, and a long α-helix. This subdomain is found only in EcoRV and PvuII.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt;

== Mode of action ==

Like [[EcoRI]], EcoRV forms a [[homodimer]] in solution before binding and acting on its [[recognition sequence]].&lt;ref name=Bitinaite_et_al_2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bitinaite J, Wah DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I  |title=FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=18 |pages=10570–10575 |year=1998|pmid=9724744  |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570 |pmc=27935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the enzyme binds weakly to a non-specific site on the DNA. It randomly walks along the molecule until the specific recognition site is found.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt; EcoRV has a high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

Binding of the enzyme induces a conformational change in the DNA, bending it by about 50°. DNA bending results in the unstacking of the bases, widening of the minor groove, and compression of the major groove. This brings the phosphodiester linkage to be broken closer to the active site of the enzyme, where it can be cleaved. Cleavage occurs within the recognition sequence, and does ''not'' require ATP hydrolysis.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt;

EcoRV is the only type II restriction [[endonuclease]] known to cause a major protein-induced conformational change in the DNA.&lt;ref name=Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pingoud A, Jeltsch A |title=Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases  |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=29 |issue=18 |pages=3705–3727 |year=2001 |pmid=11557805 |doi=10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 |pmc=55916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

EcoRV is often used to cut open a [[plasmid]] vector to insert a [[gene]]-of-interest during [[gene cloning]]. The enzyme is supplied by many manufacturers and requires [[bovine serum albumin]] to work properly.

This is commonly referred to as ''reading into'' the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = eisegesis… the interpretation of a text (as of the Bible) by reading into it one's own ideas… | last = Webster | title = New Collegiate Dictionary | page = 364 | publisher = G. &amp; C. Merriam | edition = 8th | year = 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The act is often used to "prove" a pre-held point of concern to the reader and to provide him or her with [[confirmation bias]] in accordance with his or her pre-held agenda. Eisegesis is best understood when contrasted with ''[[exegesis]]''. While exegesis is the process of drawing out the meaning from a text in accordance with the context and discoverable meaning of its author, ''eisegesis'' occurs when a reader imposes his or her interpretation into and onto the text. As a result, exegesis tends to be objective when employed effectively while eisegesis is regarded as highly subjective.

The plural of eisegesis is ''eisegeses'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|s|i:|z}}). An individual who practices eisegesis is known as an ''eisegete'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|t}}); this is also the verb form. The term "eisegete" is often used in a mildly derogatory fashion.

Although the terms ''eisegesis'' and ''[[exegesis]]'' are commonly heard in association with Biblical interpretations, both (and especially exegesis) are broadly used across literary disciplines.

==In Biblical study==
While [[exegesis]] is an attempt to determine the historical context within which a particular verse exists—the so-called "[[Sitz im Leben]]" or life setting—eisegetes often neglect this aspect of [[Bible |Biblical study]].

In the field of [[Biblical exegesis]], scholars take great care to avoid eisegesis. In this field, eisegesis is regarded as "poor exegesis".

In the field of ''biblical [[Prooftext |proof texts]]'', Christian theologians and missionaries are often accused of practicing eisegesis using isolated, out-of-context quotations from the Christian Bible to establish a proposition or to read Christ into the Hebrew Bible.

While some denominations and scholars denounce Biblical eisegesis, many Christians are known to employ it—albeit inadvertently—as part of their own experiential [[theology]]. Modern [[Evangelicalism |evangelical]] scholars accuse [[liberal Protestant]]s of practicing Biblical eisegesis, while [[Mainline (Protestant) |mainline]] scholars accuse [[Fundamentalist Christianity |fundamentalists]] of practicing eisegesis. [[Roman Catholic Church |Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church |Orthodox Christians]] say that all [[Protestantism |Protestants]] engage in eisegesis, because the [[Bible]] can be correctly understood only through the lens of [[Holy Tradition]] as handed down by the institutional Church; this is articulated in the ''[[Dei verbum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dei verbum | chapter = III |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html| website= The Vatican |publisher= The Holy See |accessdate= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews, in turn, might assert that Christians practice eisegesis when they read the Old Testament as anticipating Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaiser, Jr.|Kaiser, W. C., Jr.]], ''The Majesty of God in the Old Testament: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching'' ([[Grand Rapids, MI]]: [[Baker Publishing Group |Baker Academic]], 2007), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=1fgSJLLanNIC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 16–17].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, M. [http://www.aish.com/sp/ph/Isaiah_53_The_Suffering_Servant.html "Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant—Cutting Through the Distortions and Mistranslations of this Enigmatic Text"], Aish, May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conducting Bible translation, translators have to make many exegetical decisions. Sometimes the decisions made by translators are criticized by those who disagree, and who characterize the work of the translators as involving "eisegesis". Some translators make their doctrinal distinctives clear in a preface, such as Stephen Reynolds in his [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], where he explained his belief that Christians should never drink alcohol, and translated accordingly. Such translators may be accused by some of eisegesis, but they have made their positions clear.

Exactly what constitutes eisegesis remains a source of debate among theologians, but most scholars agree about the importance of determining the authorial intentions. Determining the author's intent can often be difficult, especially for books which were written anonymously.

'''Elephant hunting''' or '''elephant [[poaching]]''' and exploitation of the [[ivory trade]] are illegal in [[Chad]] and pose a major threat to elephant populations. The profitable [[ivory]] industry is also a threat to the lives of rangers, even in the national parks, such as [[Zakouma National Park]], the worst-affected area.

==History==
Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|title=African Elephants Slaughtered in Herds Near Chad Wildlife Park|first=Brian|last=Handwerk|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=17 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017173341/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/central-africas-wildlife-rangers-face-deadly-risks.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382003098-yauBx4MSdHcb4DxeUgSrUw|title=Rangers in Isolated Central Africa Uncover Grim Cost of Protecting Wildlife|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, since the mid-1980s the elephant population has declined from 150,000 to a reported figure of just 2,000 in the Chad-[[Cameroon]] region by one source&lt;Ref name=Guard&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/19/86-elephants-chad-poaching-massacre|title= 86 elephants killed in Chad poaching massacre|first=Celeste|last=Hicks|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 in Chad alone in 2013 according to another source&lt;ref name = IvoryCurse&gt;Vera, Varun and Ewing, Thomas (April 2014) [http://www.bornfreeusa.org/downloads/pdf/Ivorys-Curse-2014.pdf Ivory's Curse] Born Free USA and C4ADS, Retrieved 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; because of intense poaching. American journalist [[Lisa Ling]] has visited Chad to explore the country's elephant poaching problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |title=Renowned journalist Lisa Ling speaking @ UMSL |first=Shannon |last=Howard |date=3 March 2012 |publisher=NOCO ~ The online magazine of North St. Louis County |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194325/https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2012 attack by mounted poachers near the SOS Elephants camp in the [[Chari-Baguirmi Region]], 28 elephants were slaughtered and most of their tusks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/44721/print|title=Dozens of elephants massacred in Chad|first=Laurel |last=Neme|publisher=Environmental News Network|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another attack in September 2012, about {{convert|50|mi}} from the boundaries of the Zakouma National Park, five rangers were killed; one is still missing and presumed dead. The [[Sudanese Armed Forces|Sudanese military]] have been blamed for the attacks and the slaughtering of elephants not only in Zakouma and elsewhere in Chad, but also in other African nations, including Cameroon.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; As of 2012, a small team was responsible for battling to protect the remaining 450 elephants in Zakouma. One of the worst massacres took place in 14–15 March 2013 when 89 elephants, including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves, were slaughtered by poachers near the town of [[Gamba, Chad|Gamba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/press-releases/poachers-kill-at-least-89-elephants-in-chad|title=Poachers Kill at Least 89 Elephants in Chad|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]]|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Stephanie Vergniault, a French lawyer, screenwriter, and conservationist who has been working in Chad since 2009, founded the SOS Elephants organization to protect the elephant population. In an interview in 2010, Vergniault stated that the population of elephants in Chad had declined by 85 percent in the previous three decades, and that if the same rate of poaching continues, "not a single elephant" would be alive in Chad within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0512-hance_chad.html#Ll676J36vAfPYtVV.99|title=A nation of tragedies: the unseen elephant wars of Chad |first=Jeremy |last=Hance|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=18 October 2013|publisher= Mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12643">[[File:Witches' stones Jersey.jpg|thumb|Weatherproofing seam between a stone chimney and a tile roof on a building in [[Jersey]], [[Channel Islands]]. The lead flashing is seen as light gray sheets at the base of the chimney.]]
'''Flashing''' refers to thin pieces of impervious material installed to prevent the passage of water into a structure from a joint or as part of a [[Weathering|''weather resistant barrier'' (WRB)]] system. In modern buildings, flashing is intended to decrease water penetration at objects such as [[Chimney|chimneys]], vent pipes, walls, windows and door openings to make buildings more durable and to reduce indoor [[mold]] problems. Metal flashing materials include [[lead]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[stainless steel]], [[Zinc|zinc alloy]], and other materials.

== Etymology and related terms ==
The origin of the term ''flash'' and ''flashing'' are uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Flash, n.4, flash, v.1, flashing,&lt;/ref&gt; but may come from the Middle English verb ''flasshen'', 'to sprinkle, splash', related to ''flask''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flashing referenced 04/12/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

''Counter-flashing'' (or ''cover flashing'', ''cap flashing'') is a term used when there are two parallel pieces of flashing employed together&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/counterflashing accessed 04/12/2013&lt;/ref&gt; such as on a chimney, where the counter-flashing is built into the chimney and overlaps a replaceable piece of ''base flashing''. Strips of lead used for flashing an edge were sometimes called an ''apron'',&lt;ref&gt;Loudon, J. C.. An encyclopædia of cottage, farm, and villa architecture and furniture; containing numerous designs for dwelling … each design accompanied by analytical and critical remarks .... London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, &amp; Longman, 1833. 126. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is still used for the piece of flashing below a chimney. The up-hill side of a chimney may have a small gable-like assembly called a cricket with ''cricket flashing'' or on narrow chimneys with no cricket a ''back flashing'' or ''back pan flashing''. Flashing may be let into a groove in a wall or chimney called a ''[[reglet]]''.

== Purpose ==
Before the availability of sheet products for flashing builders used creative methods to minimize water penetration such as angling roof shingles away from the joint, placing chimneys at the ridge, building steps into the sides of chimneys to throw off water and covering seams between roofing materials with mortar [[flaunching]]. The introduction of manufactured flashing decreased water penetration at obstacles such as chimneys, vent pipes, walls which abut roofs, window and door openings, etc. thus making buildings more durable and reducing indoor [[mold]] problems. Moreover, flashing is important to ensure integrity of the roof prior to a [[solar panel]] installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Roof Flashing &amp; Why is It Needed When Installing Solar Panels|url=http://www.allseasonsolar.net/roof-flashing-needed-installing-solar-panels/|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In builders books, by 1832 Loudons ''An Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture...'' gives instruction on installing lead flashing and 1875 ''Notes on Building Construction'' gives detailed instruction and is well illustrated with methods still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Percy Guillemard Llewellyn. ''Notes on building construction''. Part 1. London, Oxford and Cambridge: Rivingtons, 1875. Chapter 10, Plumbers work. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashing may be exposed or concealed. Exposed flashing is usually of a sheet metal and concealed flashing may be metal or a flexible, adhesive backed, material particularly around wall penetrations such as window and door openings.

== Materials ==
In earlier days, [[birch bark]] was occasionally used as a flashing material.&lt;ref&gt;''Old-time New England'' Journal of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, volumes 52-55 1961.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Most flashing materials today are metal, plastic, rubber, or impregnated paper.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Karl F. "Flashing". ''Concise Encyclopedia of Construction Terms and Phrases''. New York: Momentum, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal flashing materials include lead, aluminium, copper,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Multiple authors. ''Roofing, flashing &amp; waterproofing''. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; stainless steel, zinc alloy, other [[architectural metals]] or a metal with a coating such as galvanized steel, lead-coated copper, anodized aluminum, [[terne]]-coated copper, [[galvalume]] (aluminum-zinc alloy coated sheet steel), and metals similar to [[stone-coated metal roofing]]. Metal flashing should be provided with expansion joints on long runs to prevent deformation of the metal sheets due to expansion and contraction, and should not stain or be stained by adjacent materials or react chemically with them. An important type of potential chemical reaction between metal flashing materials is [[galvanic corrosion]]. Copper and lead cannot be used in contact with or even above aluminum, zinc, or coated steel without an increased risk of premature corrosion. Also, Aluminum and zinc flashing cannot be used in contact with pressure treated wood due to rapid corrosion. Aluminum is also damaged by wet mortar and wet plaster. [[Salt spray]] in coastal areas may accelerate corrosion. so stainless steel, copper, or coated aluminum are recommended flashing materials near salt water.

Types of ''flexible flashing'' products are rubberized asphalt, butyl rubber, [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (sometimes known as kylar or hylar), and acrylic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wardell, "Flexible flashing:Tips For Getting the Most Out of These Useful Products". ''Journal of Light Construction''. vol. 32. no. 7. April, 2014. 51-58. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The different types have different application temperature ranges, material adhesion compatibility, chemical compatibility, levels of volatile organic compounds, resistance to ultraviolet light exposure. No flexible flashing material is designed to remain exposed over the long term as are metal flashing materials.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Adhesive backed materials are convenient during installation, but such adhesives are not intended for long-term water-resistance.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Copper]] is an excellent material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, solderability, workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life ''(see: [[Copper in architecture#Flashing|copper flashing]])''. This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage.&lt;ref&gt;The glory of copper; ''Metal Roofing Magazine,'' December 2002/January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flashings and copings, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/intro.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cold rolled (to 1/8-hard temper) copper is recommended for most flashing applications. This material offers more resistance than soft copper to the stresses of expansion and contraction. Soft copper can be specified where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated roof shapes. Thermal movement in flashings is prevented or is permitted only at predetermined locations.&lt;ref&gt;Sternthal, Daniel (2000). Copper flashings in contemporary construction, ''The Construction Specifier,'' Magazine of the Construction Specifications Institute, October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

"Soft zinc" is a newer, proprietary flashing material.  It is a relatively malleable material, making it useful for complex roofing connections.  It provides normal soft soldering capabilities and delivers easy folding.  Soft zinc is said to be an "environmentally friendly" replacement for lead flashing; like lead, it is recyclable, while avoiding lead-contaminated runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metaltech-usa.com/soft-zinc.html|title=Soft Zinc-RHEINZINK – Flashing|work=MetalTech-USA – Metal Fabricator and Distributor in Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Hôtel Demoret - Moulins (2).jpg|thumb|The flashing visible here is the ''apron'' below the [[dormer]] and the ''valley flashing'' in the ''open valley''. The ''step flashing'' (soakers) are properly installed underneath the roof and wall shingles and thus is not visible. Hôtel Demoret [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]], France]]
Flashing types are named according to location or shape:
;Roof flashing
: placed around discontinuities or objects which protrude from the [[roof]] of a [[building]] to deflect water away from [[Hemming and seaming|seams]] or joints and in valleys where the runoff is concentrated.
;Wall flashing
: may be embedded in a wall to direct water that has penetrated the wall back outside, or it may be applied in a manner intended to prevent the entry of water into the wall.  Wall flashing is typically found at interruptions in the wall, such as windows and points of structural support.
;Sill flashing (or sill pan)
: A concealed flashing placed under windows or door thresholds to prevent water from entering a wall at those points.
;Roof penetration flashing 
: Used to waterproof pipes, supports, cables, and all roof protrusions.  Stainless steel penetration flashings have proven to be the longest lasting and most reliable roof flashing type.
;Channel flashing 
: Shaped like a “U” or channel to catch water (e.g., where the edge of a tile roof meets a wall).
;Through wall flashing 
: Spans the thickness of the wall and directs water to weep holes.
;Cap flashing (drip cap) 
: Often used above windows and doors.
;Drip edge 
: A metal used at the edges of a roof.
;Step flashing (soaker, base flashing) 
: Pieces of flashing material which overlap each other in "steps".
;Counter flashing (cap flashing) 
: Covers a base flashing.
;Pipe flashing (pipe boot, vent boot, pipe flange) 
: A product used where pipes penetrate roofs.
;Chimney flashing 
: A general term for flashing a chimney.
;Kickout flashing 
: At the very bottom of a roof/wall intersection, the lowermost step flashing specially formed to deflect water away from the wall.
;Valley flashing 
: In the valley of two intersecting roof planes.

A structure incorporating flashing has to be carefully engineered and constructed so that water is directed away from the structure and not inside. Flashing improperly installed can direct water ''into'' a building.

== Environmental impact ==
In the US and UK, at least, lead flashing and fittings are still readily available, despite the environmental concerns associated with bulk use of this heavy metal.  The Lead Sheet Association touts its recyclability and extreme durability, 500 years, compared to modern materials that can fail within 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadsheet.co.uk/leads_green_credentials|title=Lead's Green Credentials – The Lead Sheet Association|work=leadsheet.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[broadcast engineering]], a '''frequency extender''' is an [[Electronics|electronic]] [[Information appliance|device]] that allows [[high-fidelity]] [[analog (signal)|analog]]ue [[sound reproduction|audio]] to be sent over regular [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] [[telephone line]]s, without the loss of higher [[audio frequencies]] ([[Treble (sound)|treble]]).  It is an extended [[concept]] of a [[telephone hybrid]].

The [[concept]] uses frequency shifting to overcome the [[narrowband|narrow]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of regular telephone systems.  The input [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is sent on one telephone line as-is, or in some cases upshifted to provide extra low-frequency response, and sent on a second line shifted down by 3 [[kHz]], which is normally the upper [[bandpass]] limit in telephony.  Thus, an audio frequency of 5&amp;nbsp;kHz is sent at 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.  A receiver on the other end then shifts the second line back up and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]] it with the first.  This results in greatly improved audio, adding a full [[octave]] of range, and pushing the total bandpass to 6&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The sound is then acceptable for [[Human voice|voice]], if not for [[music]].

It is also possible to add other lines, each increasing the bandpass by another 3&amp;nbsp;kHz.  However, the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]] takes over, because each successive octave is double the size of the last.  A third line  pushes the bandpass up 50[[%]] to 9&amp;nbsp;kHz, equivalent to [[AM radio]].  A fourth line would push it up 33% to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz.  [[FM radio]] quality would require five telephone lines to be installed, pushing the bandpass up 25% to 15&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The audio is shifted down by 6,9, and 12&amp;nbsp;kHz respectively for each additional line.

Frequency extenders have been nearly eliminated by [[POTS codec]]s.

The '''Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory''' ('''GFDL''') is a laboratory in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR). The current director is Dr. [[Venkatachalam Ramaswamy]]. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GFDL is engaged in comprehensive long lead-time research to expand the scientific understanding of the physical processes that govern the behavior of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the [[ocean]]s as [[Fluid mechanics|complex fluid systems]]. These systems can then be modeled mathematically and their [[Empirical research|phenomenology]] can be studied by computer simulation methods.

GFDL's accomplishments include the development of the first climate models to study global warming, the first comprehensive ocean prediction codes, and the first dynamical models with significant skill in hurricane track and intensity predictions. Much current research within the laboratory is focused around the development of Earth System Models for assessment of natural and human-induced climate change.

==Major accomplishments==

*The development of a state-of-art hurricane model and its transfer to operations in the NOAA National Weather Service and the Navy.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;

== Scientific groups ==
The GFDL has a diverse community of about 300 researchers, collaborators and staff, with many from Britain, India, China, Japan, France, etc. The laboratory is currently organized into several scientific groups (listed alphabetically below) as well as a large computer support group.

===Atmospheric physics, chemistry and climate===
Current head: Dr. Hiram Levy II

This group focuses on processes that affect the vertical structure of the atmosphere, such as convection and radiation. A particular focus is the role of aerosols in climate, both through direct effects on the radiative balance, and indirect effects on cloud physics.

===Climate and ecosystems===
Current head: Ron Stouffer

This group focuses on interactions between the physical climate
and biogeochemical systems, both in the land and ocean. Development of GFDL's Earth System Model is centered in this group.

===Climate diagnostics===
Current head: Dr. Ngar-Chung (Gabriel) Lau

This group focuses on comparing models with observations, developing observational datasets that can be compared with models, and using models to isolate key processes that regulate interannual variability in the ocean and atmosphere.

===Climate change, variability and prediction===
Current head: Dr. Tom Delworth

The largest group in the lab centers on the development
of numerical models for predictions and projections of climate
on seasonal-to-centennial time scales. Major projects include the development of El Nino predictions for seasonal forecasting, and the production of IPCC-class climate models.

===Oceans and climate ===
Current head: Dr. Robert Hallberg

This group focuses on the role played by the oceans in the large-scale climate system, and on developing state-of-the-art numerical codes to simulate the ocean.

===Weather and atmospheric dynamics===
Current head: Dr. [[Isaac Held]]

This group focuses on the dynamics of the atmosphere, with particular emphasis on the interactions between waves and turbulence and the large-scale flow. Development of GFDL's hurricane model is supported from this group.

== Facilities ==
The GFDL is located at [[Princeton University]]'s Forrestal Campus in Princeton, NJ.

Since March 2011, the GFDL no longer possesses an on-site [[supercomputer]]. They instead utilize a [[massively parallel]] [[Cray]] supercomputer with over 30,000 [[processor core]]s  which is currently located at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]]. This contrasts from their previous systems architecture, which consisted of eight [[Silicon Graphics]] [[Altix]] computers, each housing 1024 [[processor core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCRC website|url=http://www.ncrc.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hardware updates occur on average, every 18 months.

The GFDL has been using high-performance computing systems to perform numerical modeling since the 1950s.

== Alumni ==
* [[Joseph Smagorinsky]]: GFDL's first director
* [[Jerry Mahlman]]: GFDL's second director
* Ants Leetmaa: GFDL's third director
* [[Kirk Bryan (American Oceanographer)]]
* [[Syukoro Manabe]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4201">'''Heterotopy''' is an [[evolution]]ary change in the spatial arrangement of an animal's [[embryonic development]], complementary to [[heterochrony]], a change to the rate or timing of a development process. It was first identified by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866 and has remained less well studied than heterochrony.

==Concept==
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

The concept of heterotopy, bringing evolution about by a change in the spatial arrangement of some process within the [[embryo]], was introduced by the German zoologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866. He gave as an example a change in the positioning of the [[germ layer]] which created the [[gonad]]s. Since then, heterotopy has been studied less than its companion, [[heterochrony]] which results in more readily observable phenomena like [[neoteny]]. With the arrival of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] in the late 20th century, heterotopy has been identified in changes in growth rate; in the distribution of [[protein]]s in the embryo; the creation of the vertebrate [[jaw]]; the repositioning of the mouth of [[nematode]] worms, and of the anus of irregular [[sea urchin]]s. Heterotopy can create new morphologies in the embryo and hence in the adult, helping to explain how evolution shapes bodies.&lt;ref name="ZelditchFink2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelditch |first1=Miriam L. |last2=Fink |first2=William L. |title=Heterochrony and heterotopy: stability and innovation in the evolution of form |journal=Paleobiology |volume=22 |issue=02 |year=2015 |pages=241–254 |doi=10.1017/S0094837300016195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Held152"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |author1link=Lewis Held |title=[[How the Snake Lost its Legs]].

In terms of evolutionary developmental biology, heterotopy means the positioning of a developmental process at any level in an embryo, whether at the level of the [[gene]], a circuit of genes, a body structure, or an [[organ (biology) |organ]]. It often involves [[homeosis]], the evolutionary change of one organ into another. Heterotopy is achieved by the rewiring of an organism's [[genome]], and can accordingly create rapid evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Held152"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SwansonSchwimmer2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swanson |first1=Christina I. |last2=Schwimmer |first2=David B. |last3=Barolo |first3=Scott |title=Rapid Evolutionary Rewiring of a Structurally Constrained Eye Enhancer |journal=Current Biology |volume=21 |issue=14 |year=2011 |pages=1186–1196 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist Brian K. Hall argues that heterochrony offers such a simple and readily understood mechanism for reshaping bodies that heterotopy has likely often been overlooked. Since starting or stopping a process earlier or later, or changing its rate, can clearly cause a wide variety of changes in body shape and size ([[allometry]]), biologists have in Hall's view often invoked heterochrony to the exclusion of heterotopy.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Brian K. |title=Time and Place in Evolution: Heterochrony and Heterotopy |year=1999 |pages=375–391 |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3961-8_24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS''' (in French ''Bibliothèque de sciences humaines et sociales Descartes-CNRS'') is one of the most important French libraries concerning sociology, linguistics and science education. The library collaborates with BNF ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) as an associated pole (''pôle associé'') on topics such as health and public policy, Ethics and bioethics, Health sciences and society, drug use and abuse, social psychology.

Being a ''unité mixte de service'' (mixed service unit) (UMS 3036), the library both depends of [[Paris Descartes University]] (Paris V) and the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS). It is located in Rue des Saints-Pères, in the [[Latin Quarter (Paris)|Latin Quarter]].

==History==

The collection of the library comes from two different origins :

===Paris 5 University Human and Social Sciences Libraries===

A part comes from the former Human and Social Sciences collections of [[Paris Descartes University]] (formerly Paris V University) – the collections of social sciences and linguistics were held in the [[Sorbonne]] and those of science education in a library in Rue des Saints-Pères  (6th district of Paris). Part of the major linguistics collection come from the private libraries of well-known 19th and 20th-century scholars such as [[Abel Hovelacque]], [[Joseph Vendryes]], and others.

===CNRS Sociology Library===

The main part of the collection comes from the former Sociological Library of the CNRS. The collections increased during the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Socio CNRS"&gt;[http://www.bibliothequedesociologie.cnrs.fr/histoire.php CNRS Sociological Library website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Gurvitch]] gave books that he had purchased in the United States to the library&lt;ref&gt;Gift from the Sociology Department of the New School for Social Research of New York&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Halbwachs]] also gave a part of his private library to the Sociological Study Center (''Centre d’études sociologiques'', CES) just after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], « Le Centre d'études sociologiques » dans ''Synthese'', vol. 5, jul.-aug. 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;130-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The library, founded by Lucienne Thomas, had the same fate as the CES. First situated in Rue de Varenne (7th ''arrondissement''), it moved to Rue Cardinet (17th ''arrondissement'') in 1959. Its aim is to buy and make available books and knowledge to researchers but also to indicate the resources at a national scale: thus, the library is in charge of the "sociology" section of the ''Bulletin Signalétique'' (a kind of bibliography of French science articles) at the beginning of the 70s.&lt;ref name="Socio CNRS"/&gt;

Jacques Lautman, head of CNRS' Human and Society sciences department, decided to change its name in «Bibliothèque de sociologie du CNRS» (CNRS Sociology Library) in 1986. It moved one more time to Rue Pouchet (next to Rue Cardinet). Closed for a time while being reorganized, it re-opened in 2004 : it then held 50,000 sociological books and a collection of  1,500 periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliothequedesociologie.cnrs.fr/fonds.php CNRS collection]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it became part of the new Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS.&lt;ref name="Socio CNRS"/&gt;

==The library currently==
[[Image:Envoi Dumézil à Halbwachs.JPG|left|thumb|350 px|Book signed by [[Georges Dumézil]] and offered to [[Maurice Halbwachs]].&lt;br/&gt;Maurice Halbwachs Collection]]
The library reopened at the end of 2006,&lt;ref&gt;''Les Dialogues de Descartes'', 2006, n°39, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time that Paris Descartes Social Sciences Faculty moved from the Sorbonne to its new location in Rue des Saints-Pères.

It is a library reserved for scientific research, mainly for grad students, scholars, social and human scientists from all universities and scientific centers. It possesses a collection of more than 80,000 books and 2,000 periodicals (of which at least 500 subscriptions are running) - add all the electronics periodicals and reviews subscriptions bought by the University Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.univ-paris5.fr/spip.php?article373 Paris Descartes University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the former "Friends of Centre d'Études Sociologiques'Society" (SACES) has entrusted to the library some photographic portraits of sociologists : Raymond Aron, André Davidovitch, Émile Durkheim, Georges Friedmann, Louis Gernet, Alain Girard, Marcel Granet, Georges Gurvitch, Maurice Halbwachs, Robert Hertz,Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Marcel Mauss, Pierre Naville, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Jean Stoetzel. The complete collection consists of 15 framed photographs, size 32.5 × 38.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12.79 × 15.15 in). Part of this collection is available on the open archive [http://medihal.archives-ouvertes.fr/ MediHAL]

But it is also an experimental library for new tool for scientific information circulation in France and abroad. The library plays an important part to digitize French Social Sciences reviews for Persée website (created by French Education Ministry). It also plays a leading role in several national projects of CNRS such as TGE-Adonis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tge-adonis.fr/ TGE Adonis website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Isore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isore.cnrs.fr/ Réseau Isore]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperpersonal theory''' (HPT) is related and understood through [[computer-mediated communication]](CMC). Hyperpersonal theory is part of [[interpersonal communication]] theory meaning that the HPT suggests CMC due to the uses technological messages rather than [[face-to-face interaction]]s. According to Erin Schumaker (2013) the hyperpersonal theory represents how people communicate online rather than FtF.  The theory displays predictions on how people present themselves in a virtual environment. HPT demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumaker|first1=Erin|date=2013|title=Exploring the Hyperpersonal Model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication|journal=Dissertation at Ohio State University|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walther ==
Joseph Walther is noted to be the founder of this theory, however, he uses his finding to teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In his research he found "the hyperpersonal model of CMC proposes a set of concurrent theoretically based processes to explain how CMC may facilitate impressions and relationships online"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes and Functions|last1=Walther|first1=Joseph|location=Chapter 14|pages=443–471|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to FtF relationships. The model Walther created has four main components that illustrate how CMC relates to message structure and reception:&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

# Effects due to receiver processes
# Effects among message senders
# Attributes of the channel
# Feedback effects

Effects due to receiver processes explains how communication could be misunderstood or exaggerated perceptions by the sender. By this, Walther explains that without FtF interactions and gesture cues, receivers fill in the missing information from the sender. The second component involves the sender. Walther illustrates that senders are able to avoid distractions of conversation with FtF interaction, allowing the sender to compose messages making themselves more desirable over text and online rather than the receiver being able to see their characteristics and gesture cues. Senders are able to disclose information while being able to provide only the information they want the receiver to know. The third component describes how CMC is the channel of the conversation. In this section, senders are able to take their time and craft messages or responses without conversation flow.  Senders are able to perfect messages through the channel without  communication interruptions. The fourth component involves feedback from CMC. It exemplifies behavioral conformation and overall impressions made by the receiver of the channel. The feedback effects component has been under study recently due to acknowledging if this component was enhancing the identity of the sender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These four components represent how CMC may effect how relationships online exceed offline relationships.

== Background ==
Orignination of the hyperpersonal theory model came from [[Joseph Walther]]. He is the Director of Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Walther, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara says, "his teaching and research focus on [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and social media in personal relationships, groups, educational settings, and inter-ethic conflict, topics on which he has contributed several original theories and numerous experiments and surveys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther|title=UC Santa Barbara Department of Communication|website=comm.ucsb.edu|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-mediated communication ==
Computer-mediated communication, also known as CMC, relates to hyperpersonal theory model because it suggests that computer-mediated communication can turn hyperpersonal since they both lack the use of face-to-face communication. CMC "may be [[wikt:impersonal|impersonal]]".&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walther |first1=Joseph B. |title=Computer-Mediated Communication |journal=Communication Research |date=29 June 2016 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1177/009365096023001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now online friendships and virtual communities. CMC was "emerged as an unintended byproduct of linking large computers to one another for security and information redundancy".&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; In doing so, operators found that the computers were able to send messages to other people, enabling computer-mediated communication. From this, researchers began to question whether CMC could replace traveling to events, such as business meetings, and indicate whether or not CMC might provide meetings more effective than FtF meetings.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; This is where researchers developed online behaviors vs personal interaction behaviors. They tested this by interactions through e-mail. Researchers then found that computer-mediated communication was more task-oriented rather than FtF conversations/meetings.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel's [[Media richness theory|Media Richness theory]] depict FtF interactions contain more richness than CMC. Daft and Lengel state, "messages should be communicated on channels with sufficient and appropriate media richness capacities."&lt;ref name=":423"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John|last2=Zmud|first2=Robert|date=April 1999|title=Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential Nature of Media Richness Perceptions|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=42|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continue to propose that "messages communicated on channels that are inappropriate to the equivocality of a situation and the richness of the information may be misinterpreted by recipients or may be otherwise ineffective"&lt;ref name=":423" /&gt; Whereas, Walther explains HPT represents how communication interpersonally online has enhanced society with new technologies, allowing people to create virtual communities. Walther enacted the finding and research of CMC when Daft and Lengel stated that management problems became too difficult and complex; stating that the richness of communication was lost when tying to convey adequate insight and understanding &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; Walther explains that growing numbers of reports indicate that CMC interactions are sometimes just as interactive as FtF interactions.

== Uses of Hyperpersonal theory ==
Hyperpersonal theory Model describes how people use virtual communication, or [[computer-mediated communication]], rather than [[face-to-face communication]] (FtF). There are two directions Walther makes on the work of CMC and its interpersonal effects:&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

# To integrate theories and findings based on impersonal and interpersonal interactions in CMC, allowing favorable outcomes for certain contexts in HPT &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;
# To view a new perspective on intimacy, solidarity, and liking via CMC, allowing HPT to surpass FtF interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock ===
Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use Joseph Walther's hyperpersonal theory model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established "some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Crystal|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalie|last3=Hancock|first3=Jeffrey|date=2010|title=The Disclosure–Intimacy Link in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Attributional Extension of the Hyperpersonal Model|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=37|pages=58–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depicted that people tend to "put their best foot forward"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that "related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a "more positive hyperpersonal relationship”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Daft &amp; Lengel's Media Richness Theory ===
Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt;

=== Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory ===
[[Ned Kock]], is a researcher of the [[Media naturalness theory|Media Naturalness]] and [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion theory]] (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to "richer" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory (Carlson and Zmud 1999) essentially undercut Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kock|first=Ned|last2=Garza|first2=Vanessa|date=April–June 2011|title=Media Naturalness and Compensatory Channel Expansion: A Study of Online and Face-to-Face Sections of the Same Course|url=|journal=International Journal of Distance Education Technologies|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve "positive effects" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning.

== Critique ==
Walther describes some challenges to CMC research. His area of concern lies within three areas:&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

# Neglect of off-line comparisons in CMC
# New technologies
# Studying interpersonal communication

Walthers seeks to tell researchers not compare FtF communication with CMC due the fact they rely on different users and features.

According to Charles Soukup (2000), the problem with CMC communication lies within the multi-media aspects. Many researcher have lacked studying new technologies and multi-media outlets in today's society. Researchers are failing to see the new dimensions CMC has to offer, the researchers are relying too much on textual aspects of CMC rather than communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soukup |first1=Charles |title=Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=30 June 2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=407–425 |doi=10.1177/1461444800002004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict''' (IFHV) at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (Germany) is one of the leading research institutes on [[humanitarian law]] and [[humanitarian studies]] in Europe.

It was founded in 1988 on the initiative of Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Knut Ipsen, then rector of Ruhr University Bochum, as a means to conduct research on international conflicts and provide solutions to resolve them. The IFHV’s research is highly interdisciplinary with a focus on international humanitarian studies from a legal and social-scientific perspective.

The Institute also provides high-level academic and professional training for the next generation of personnel in the area of humanitarian action. The IFHV’s interdisciplinary angle is put into practice through its Joint Master’s Programme in International Humanitarian Action, part of the [[European University Network on Humanitarian Assistance]] (NOHA).

Since 2014, the Institute is headed by Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. ([[Harvard]]). Its staff consists of about 25 employees (including student research assistants) and about 10 PhD students.

'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==
[[File:Bonampak mural. Room 1. Musicians and dancers.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mural from [[Bonampak]].]]

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José Guadalupe Posada, Calavera oaxaqueña, broadsheet, 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 broadsheet by [[José Guadalupe Posada]].]]

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros05.jpg|thumb|View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City]]
Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130519329 Revolutionary Mural To Return To L.A. After 80 Years.]  npr. October 26, 2010.  Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;), was restored by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] and the América Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Christopher.

Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4354">The '''Mill Branch archaeological site''' is located in [[Warren County, Georgia]] west of [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and south of [[Thomson, Georgia|Thomson]]. It is located in the [[Brier Creek (Savannah River)|Brier Creek]] watershed.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;R. Jerald Ledbetter (1995) ''Archaeological Investigations at Mill Branch Sites 9WR4 and 9WR11 Warren County, Georgia''. Interagency Archeological Services Division&lt;/ref&gt; A [[reservoir]] was deemed necessary to assist in kaolin processing during times of drought. For this project to commence, a permit was needed from the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], which required a [[Cultural resources management|cultural resource]] impact study to first be done.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  J.M. Huber Corporation contracted Southeastern Archaeological Services to do an initial survey of the area in 1988 with additional data recovery in 1990.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; J.M Huber Corporation determined that two sites surveyed by Southeastern Archaeological Services, specifically 9WR4 and 9WR11, could not be avoided or preserved. Huber no longer owns this property. These two sites were excavated between April 23 and May 31, 1990.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The field report, ''Archaeological Investigations at Mill Branch Sites 9WR4 and 9WR11 Warren County, Georgia'', was published in 1995 and compiled by R. Jerald Ledbetter.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

==9WR4==
Site 9WR4 was located on the west bank of Brier Creek with the northern boundary set by Little Brier Creek.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The site measured about 1.20 hectares in size.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  9WR4 was divided into northern, southern, and southeastern areas due to topography.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  
This site was excavated in all three sections using heavy machinery in conjunction with manual spadework. A smooth bucket backhoe was used to excavate a total of eighteen trenches as well as a 20 m x 20 m block and a 25 m x 25 m block.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The trenches were then cleaned and smoothed by hand trowel. 
Artifacts emphasizing the Early [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]], Middle Archaic, [[Woodland period#Early Woodland period|Early Woodland]], and [[Woodland period#Middle Woodland period|Middle Woodland]] periods were identified.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  Five types of [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] were found throughout 9WR4: unlined [[midden]] pits, rock lined midden pits, rock clusters, post molds, and an early dwelling.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

==Pit House==
A feature described as "the single most important discovery on 9WR4" was found in the southern section.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;   This feature was a Late Archaic midden filled pit house. Charcoal found in the hearth was radiocarbon dated to 1900-1950 B.C.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  The distribution of artifacts suggested that the artifacts were accumulated over time, and not used as fill after abandonment of the dwelling.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  
This large rectangular feature measured about 5m x 4m x 35&amp;nbsp;cm and had a volume of about 5650 liters.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  There was no evidence of multiple structures present at one time.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

==9WR11==
Site 9WR11 was located to the south of 9WR4 and just across Mill Branch which forms the northern border of the site. The site measured to about 1.20 hectares making this site about the same size as 9WR4, but due to a mature hardwood presence, fewer blocks were excavated.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  
This site was surveyed using a systematic series of [[Shovel test pit|shovel tests]], and then heavy machinery was used to clear four trenches to a maximum depth of 40&amp;nbsp;cm except for Trench 1 which was dug to a maximum of 1.2 m.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;   A smooth backhoe was used to create the trenches, and they were all 3 m wide and ranged in length from 9 m - 22.5 m.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;  Trench 3 was expanded into an excavation block. 
9WR11 was a Late Archaic primary [[Stone tool|lithic]] workshop site.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;   The majority of the artifacts found were lithic. Some [[pottery]] was found from later periods suggesting that the site may have been used as a secondary workshop in later periods.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

The '''neuroscience of aging''' is the study of the changes in the nervous system that occur with [[ageing]].  Aging is associated with many changes in the central nervous system, such as mild atrophy of the cortex that is considered non-pathological.  Aging is also associated with many neurological and neurodegenerative disease such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[dementia]], [[mild cognitive impairment]], [[parkinson's disease]], and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Rebecca C.|last2=Lockwood|first2=Alan H.|last3=Sonawane|first3=Babasaheb R.|title=Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Overview of Environmental Risk Factors|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=8 January 2017|volume=113|issue=9|pages=1250–1256|doi=10.1289/ehp.7567|pmc=1280411|issn=0091-6765|pmid=16140637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normal Structural and Neural Changes==

Neurogenesis occurs very little in adults, only occurring in the hypothalamus and striatum to a small extent in a process called [[adult neurogenesis]].  The volume of the brain actually decrease roughly 5% per decade after forty.  It is currently unclear why brain volume decreases with age, however, a few causes may include: cell death, decreased cell volume, and changes in synaptic structure.  The changes in brain volume is heterogenous across regions with prefrontal cortex receiving the most significant reduction in volume followed in order by the striatum, the temporal lobe, cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, and the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=R|title=Ageing and the brain|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=8 January 2017|volume=82|issue=964|pages=84–88|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.036665|pmc=2596698|issn=0032-5473|pmid=16461469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one review found that the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex remained relatively free of atrophy, which is consistent with the finding of emotional stability occurring with non-pathological aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mather|first1=Mara|title=The Affective Neuroscience of Aging|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=5 October 2015|volume=67|issue=1|pages=213–238|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033540|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282608397_The_Affective_Neuroscience_of_Aging?enrichId=rgreq-5778171dd33ad78a57dd35ff0c24db89-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzI4MjYwODM5NztBUzozMTIwMjI1NTI1MTQ1NjRAMTQ1MTQwMzM4MTMzMA%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|issn=1545-2085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enlargement of the ventricles, sulci and fissures are also common in non-pathological aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeMay|first1=Marjorie|title=Radiologic Changes of the Aging Brain and Skull|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|date=1984|volume=5|pages=269–275|url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/5/3/269.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may also be associated with neuroplasticity, synaptic functionality and [[voltage gated calcium channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=K. M.|last2=Nadon|first2=N. L.|last3=Morrison|first3=J. H.|last4=Thibault|first4=O.|last5=Barnes|first5=C. A.|last6=Blalock|first6=E.

This effect is particularly pronounced in the hippocampus of aged animals, and may be an important contributor to age-associated memory deficits. The hyperpolarization of a neuron can be divided into three stages: the fast, medium and slow hyperpolarization.  In aged neurons, the medium and slow hyperpolarization phases involve the prolonged opening of calcium-dependent potassium channels. The prolonging of this phase has been hypothesized to be a result of deregulated calcium and hypoactivity of cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutaminergic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Ashok|last2=Foster|first2=Thomas C.|title=Neurophysiology of Old Neurons and Synapses|journal=Brain Aging: Models, Methods, and Mechanisms|date=1 January 2007|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3882/|publisher=CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normal Functional Changes==
Episodic memory starts to decline gradually from middle age, while semantic memory increases all the way into early old age and declines thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=R|title=Ageing and the brain|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=8 January 2017|volume=82|issue=964|pages=84–88|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.036665|pmc=2596698|issn=0032-5473|pmid=16461469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Older adults tend to engage their prefrontal cortex more often during working memory tasks, possibly to compensate with executive functions.  Further impairments of cognitive function associated with aging include decrease in processing speed and inability to focus.  A model proposed to account for altered activation posits that decreased neural efficiency driven by amyloid plaques and decreased dopamine functionality lead to compensatory activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reuter-Lorenz|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Park|first2=Denise C.|title=Human Neuroscience and the Aging Mind: A New Look at Old Problems|journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences|date=8 January 2017|volume=65B|issue=4|pages=405–415|doi=10.1093/geronb/gbq035|pmc=2883872|issn=1079-5014|pmid=20478901}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decreased processing of negative stimuli as opposed to positive stimuli appear in aging, become significant enough to detect even with autonomic nervous responses to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaszniak|first1=Alfred W.|last2=Menchola|first2=Marisa|title=Behavioral neuroscience of emotion in aging|journal=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences|date=1 January 2012|volume=10|pages=51–66|doi=10.1007/7854_2011_163|pmid=21910076|issn=1866-3370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aging is also associated with decreased [[plantar reflex]] and [[achilles reflex]] response.  Nerve conductance also decreases during normal aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton|first1=Biba R.|title=The neurology of old age|journal=Clinical Medicine|date=1 February 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=54–56|doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.11-1-54|url=http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/11/1/54.full|language=en|issn=1470-2118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Transient ischemic attack]]

The misfolding of proteins is a common component of the proposed pathophysiology of many diseases associated with aging, however there is insufficient evidence to prove this.  For example, the tau hypothesis to Alzheimer's proposes that tau protein accumulation results in the breakdown neuron cytoskeletons leading to Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goedert|first1=M.|last2=Spillantini|first2=M. G.|last3=Crowther|first3=R.

Similarly the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] is hypothesized to accumulate in Parkinson's and related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galpern|first1=Wendy R.|last2=Lang|first2=Anthony E.|title=Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: a tale of two proteins|journal=Annals of Neurology|date=1 March 2006|volume=59|issue=3|pages=449–458|doi=10.1002/ana.20819|pmid=16489609|issn=0364-5134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

Treatment of an age related neurological disease varies from disease to disease.  Modifiable risk factors for dementia include [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[smoking]], [[hyperhomocysteinemia]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[obesity]](which is usually associated with many other risk factors for dementia).  Paradoxically, smoking confers protection against [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barranco Quintana|first1=JL|last2=Allam|first2=MF|last3=Del Castillo|first3=AS|last4=Navajas|first4=RF|title=Parkinson's disease and tea: a quantitative review.|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|date=February 2009|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–6|pmid=19571153|doi=10.1080/07315724.2009.10719754}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also conferring protective benefits to age related neurological disease in consumption of coffee or caffeine.&lt;ref name="pmid20182026"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santos C, Costa J, Santos J, Vaz-Carneiro A, Lunet N | title = Caffeine intake and dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = J.

==Initiation==
Usually the secret name is not given to the [[Wiktionary:neophyte|neophyte]] directly, but only after the completion of '''[[initiation]]'''. The connection between the initiation and the presentation of a secret name is considered a rite of passage by most esoteric orders.  It is understood that this process represents the mystery of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] (or [[childbirth|birth]] - [[death]] - [[reincarnation|rebirth]]).

The purpose of Nordicom work is to develop the knowledge of media´s role in society. This is done through: 
* Following and documenting media development in terms of media structure, media ownership, media [[economy]] and media use. 
* Conducting the annual survey The Media Barometer, which measures the reach of various media outlets in Sweden. 
* Publishing research literature, including the International research journal Nordicom Review and the periodic journal Nordicom-Information. 
* Publishing newsletters on media trends in the Nordic region and policy issues in [[Europe]]. 
* Continuously compiling information on how media research in the Nordic countries is developing. 
* The international research conference NordMedia, which is arranged in cooperation with the national media and communication associations in the Nordic countries. 

Nordicom is financed by the [[Nordic Council|Nordic Council of Ministers]], the [[Swedish Ministry of Culture]] and the [[University of Gothenburg]].

The '''overlap extension polymerase chain reaction''' (or '''OE-PCR''') is a variant of [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. It is also referred to as '''Splicing by overlap extension''' / '''Splicing by overhang extension (SOE) PCR'''. It is used to insert specific [[mutation]]s at specific points in a sequence or to splice smaller DNA fragments into a larger [[polynucleotide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Higuchi R, Krummel B, Saiki R |title=A general method of ''in vitro'' preparation and specific mutagenesis of DNA fragments: study of protein and DNA interactions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=16 |issue=15 |pages=7351–67 |year=1988 |pmid=3045756 |doi=10.1093/nar/16.15.7351 |pmc=338413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Splicing of DNA Molecules==
[[File:Splicing by Overlap Extension PCR.svg|thumb|300px|right|This image shows how OE-PCR might be utilized to splice two DNA sequences (red and blue). The arrows represent the 3' ends]]
As in most PCR reactions, two primers—one for each end—are used per sequence. To splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined. For each molecule, the primer at the end to be joined is constructed such that it has a 5' overhang complementary to the end of the other molecule. Following annealing when replication occurs, the DNA is extended by a new sequence that is complementary to the molecule it is to be joined to. Once both DNA molecules are extended in such a manner, they are mixed and a PCR is carried out with only the primers for the far ends. The overlapping complementary sequences introduced will serve as primers and the two sequences will be fused. This method has an advantage over other gene splicing techniques in not requiring restriction sites.

To get higher yields, some primers are used in excess as in [[asymmetric PCR]].

==Introduction of Mutations==
[[File:Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction.svg|thumb|300px|right|This image shows how OE-PCR might be utilized to delete a sequence from a DNA strand]]
To insert a mutation into a DNA sequence, a specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] is designed. The primer may contain a single substitution or contain a new sequence at its 5' end. If a [[Indel|deletion]] is required, a sequence that is 5' of the deletion is added, because the 3' end of the primer must have complementarity to the template strand so that the primer can sufficiently [[Annealing (biology)|anneal]] to the template DNA.

Following annealing of the primer to the template, [[DNA replication]] proceeds to the end of the template. The duplex is denatured and the second primer anneals to the newly formed DNA strand, containing sequence from the first primer. Replication proceeds to produce a strand of the required sequence, containing the mutation.

The duplex is denatured again and the first primer can now bind to the latest DNA strand. The replication reaction continues to produce a fully [[Dimer (biochemistry)|dimer]]ised DNA fragment. After further PCR cycles, to amplify the DNA, the sample can be separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], followed by electroelution for collection.

Efficiently generating [[oligonucleotide]]s beyond ~110 nucleotides in length is very difficult, so to insert a mutation further into a sequence than a 110 nt primer will allow, it is necessary to employ overlap extension PCR. In OE-PCR the sequence being modified is used to make two modified strands with the mutation at opposite ends, using the technique described above. After mixing and denaturation, the strands are allowed to anneal to produce three different combinations as detailed in the diagram. Only the duplex without overlap at the 5' end will allow extension by DNA polymerase in 3' to 5' direction.

Following separation, the eluted fragments of appropriate size are subject to normal PCR, using the outermost primers used in the initial, mutagenic PCR reactions.

'''Parasocial interaction''' ('''PSI''') is a term coined by Horton and Wohl in 1956 to refer to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to feel and consider media personalities almost as friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|title=Parasocial interaction - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSI is described as an [[illusion]]ary [[experience]], such that media audiences interact with [[persona]]s (e.g., talk show host, [[celebrities]], characters, [[Influencer marketing|social media influencers]]) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. 

==Evolution of the term==
Parasocial interaction was first described from the perspective of media and [[communication studies]]. In 1956, Horton and [[Richard Wohl|Wohl]]  explored the different interactions between [[mass media]] users and media figures and determined the existence of a parasocial relationship, where the user acts as though they are involved in a typical [[social relationship]].&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observation on intimacy at a distance. | journal=Psychiatry | year=1956 | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=215–229 | last=Horton | first=D. | last2=Wohl | first2=R. | doi=10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, parasocial interaction has existed before mass media, when citizen would establish a bond with political figures, gods or even spirits. Since then, the term has been adopted by psychologists, in furthering their studies of the social relationships that emerge between consumers of mass media and the figures they see represented there. Initially, Horton and Wohl viewed parasocial interactions as abnormalities resulting from a lack of time spent with others.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Perse and Rubin (1989) contested this view, finding that parasocial interactions occurred as a natural byproduct of time spent with media figures.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perse|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rubin|first2=Rebecca|title=Attribution in social and parasocial relationships|journal=Communication Research|date=1989|volume=16|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1177/009365089016001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originating from a psychological topic, extensive research of PSI has been performed in the area of [[mass communication]] with manifold results.&lt;ref name="MBB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=The television audience: a revised perspective | encyclopedia=Sociology of Mass Communication | publisher=Longman | editor=McQuail, D. | year=1972 | location=London | last=McQuail | first=D. | last2=Blumler | first2=J. | last3=Brown | first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Gratification Discrepancies and News Program Choice | journal=Communication Research | year=1981 | month= | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=451–478 | doi=10.1177/00936502810080040 | last=Palmgreen | first=P. | last2=Wenner | first2=W.

M. | last2=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists began to show their interest in the concept in the 1980s, and researchers began to develop the concept extensively within the field of communication science.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Parasocial interaction: A review of the literature and a model for future research. | author=Giles, D. C. | journal=Media Psychology | year=2002 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=279–305 | doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0403_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important questions about social psychology were raised concerning the nature of these relationships that are problematic for existing theories in those fields. The concept of parasocial interaction and detailed examination of the behavioral phenomena that it seeks to explain have considerable potential for developing psychological theory.

==Parasocial relationships==

The concepts development of PSI and PSR are interpreted and employed in a different ways in various literature. When it is applied in the use-and-gratifications approaches, the two concepts are typically treated interchangeably, with the regard primarily to a special type of "interpersonal involvement" with media figures that includes different phenomena such as interaction and identification (Rubin, Perse, &amp; Powell, 1985). In contrast to the U&amp;G approaches, research in other domains such as media psychology and semiotics, argue for a clear distinction between the two terms (Klimmt, Hartmann, &amp; Schramm, 2006). PSI specifically means the one-sided process of media person perception during media exposure; whereas PSR stands for a cross-situational relationship that a viewer or user holds to a media person, which includes specific cognitive and affective components. Schmid &amp; Klimmt (2011) further argue that PSI and PSR are progressive states such that what begins as a PSI has the potential to become a PSR. In sum, the terms, definitions, and models explicating PSI and PSR differ across scientific backgrounds and traditions.

==As a subset of social interaction==
Studying social interaction, and by extension parasocial interaction (PSI), follows a social cognitive approach to defining individual cognitive activity. Accordingly, there are similar psychological processes at work in both parasocial relationships and face-to-face interactions. However, the parasocial relationship does not follow the process of the typical long-term relationship. The media user remains a stranger to the media figure, whereas this "strangeness" would gradually evaporate in typical social interaction.

=== Scientific research ===

The research of PSI obtain significant interest after the advent of the uses and gratifications approach to mass communication research in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="MBB" /&gt; In a study of early soap opera, McQuail et al. (1972) identified two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Rosengren and Windahl (1972) further argued that PSI could be identified in the process of viewers' interacting with media figures, but such interaction did not produce identification. This is an important distinction, because identification has a longer history than PSI. Subsequent research has indicated that PSI is evident when identification is not present (Chory-Assad &amp; Yanen, 2005; de Bruin, Suijkerbujk, &amp; Jansz, 2006). During last several decades, PSI has been documented in the research analyzing the relationship between audience members and television newscasters, TV and radio talk-show hosts, sitcom characters and other TV celebrities or performers (Palmgreen, Wenner, &amp; Rayburn, 1980; Rubin &amp; Perse, 1987, Sood &amp; Rogers, 2000; Park &amp; Lennon, 2004; Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 2007). Research has also been conducted on how a favorable PSI can be facilitated between celebrities and their followers on social media, specifically through the interactions followers have with the celebrities posts on social media (Kim &amp; Song, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.083|title = Celebrity's self-disclosure on Twitter and parasocial relationships: A mediating role of social presence| journal=Computers in Human Behavior| volume=62| pages=570–577|year = 2016|last1 = Kim|first1 = Jihyun| last2=Song| first2=Hayeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different PSI scales have been employed in these studies, PSI was clearly documented with each persona (Hataway, 2008).

Noticing the importance of media in the area of psychological research, Giles (2002) asserted that  there is a need for PSI research to move away from the field of mass communication and into the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; Studies in this area is commonly conducted by focusing a key psychological issue for PSI: concerning the similarity between parasocial relations and ordinary social relations (Turner, 1993; Gleich, 1996; McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000; Giles, 2002; Jin &amp; Park, 2009). For example, Turner (1993) adopted the idea of homophily (i.e., the tendency for friendships to form between people that are alike in some designated respect) to examine the interpersonal and psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with television performers. The author found that one dimension of homophily (i.e., attitude) was the best predictor of parasocial interaction. Hataway (2008) indicated that although there seems to be prevailing to analyze PSI in the domain of social psychology, a solid connection to psychological theory and developmental theory has been missing. Hataway (2008) further suggested that more psychological research is needed in order to develop parasocial theory. Specific issues cited were "how parasocial relationships are derived from parasocial interaction and the way those relationships further influence media usage as well as a social construction of reality, and how parasocial interaction is cognitively produced" (p.&amp;nbsp;18). He saw that the majority of PSI research has been conducted by mass communication scholars as a weakness and called for psychologists to refer to Giles (2002) for directions of studies.

Another important consideration for the study of PSI at a psychological level is that there is a form of PSI existing even in interpersonal social situation. People may use fundamentally the same cognitive processes in both interpersonal and mediated communication (Perse &amp; Rubin, 1989). Giles (2002) also suggested that the element of direct interaction occurred in mediated interaction, such as talking to a presenter or celebrity guest, may continue in social interaction, with a cartoon character or a fictional protagonist in the mind.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; This may finally constitute a new way of interpreting social interaction. A further consideration is application of social cognitive approaches in individual levels. It is traditionally accepted that this approach is inadequate by itself for the study of relationships (Duck, 1994). However, a number of growing literature on the role of imagination in social interaction (Taylor, 1999; Gleason, Sebanc, &amp; Hartup, 2000; Eyal &amp; Cohen, 2006) suggests that some imaginative activity (e.g., imaginary friends) may be an influential factor in the outcome of real social interaction. PSI is nowadays regarded as an extension of normal social cognition, specifically in terms of the use of the imagination. Current PSI literature commonly acknowledge that the psychological processes acting at the individual level parallel those used in ordinary social activity and relationship building.

=== Studies with children and adolescents ===

Parasocial interaction is best explored across a lifespan, which explains the growing focus on parasocial interaction in children and adolescents. Studies have found that sex-role stereotyping is common in children's parasocial relationships with media figures, though boys most overwhelmingly chooses male characters, while young girls are less likely to prefer one gender over another. Additionally, sex-role stereotyping is more common in children ages 5–6, but decreases in children age 10-11. Existing literature also intimates that attachments, parasocial or otherwise, established in early childhood, are highly influential on relationships created later in life. Many studies have focused on adolescent girls because they are more likely to form a strong bond with a media figure and be influenced in terms of lifestyle choices.

=== Sports ===

==== Team association ====

[[Social identity theory]] says that people become motivated to behave in ways that boost their self-esteem. Having high [[self-esteem]] creates the perception that a person is intelligent, likable, and a good person. In regards to sports teams, fans create a connection within their team to attach themselves to a particular victory or championship.

====Player====

In 2012, Evan Frederick ([[University of Southern Indiana]]), Choong Hoon Lim, Galen Clavio, and Patrick Walsh ([[Indiana University]]) conducted a study on perceived parasocial relationships of Twitter users and athletes. "Analysis of the data revealed a sense of heightened interpersonal closeness based on the interaction style of the athlete. Followers of the social athlete were driven by [[interpersonal]] constructs" (p.&amp;nbsp;481).

====Branding====

In 2007, Brett Boyle and Peter Magnusson, from [[Saint Louis University]] published a study titled "Social Identity and Brand Equity Formation: A Comparative Study of Collegiate Sports Fans". The authors empirically tested fans of a University men's basketball team. According to the study students, alumni, and the general public were all a part of building brand/team equity through means of heightened social identification factors.

==Positive consequences in childhood==

=== Identity formation ===

The primary effect is that of learning: consistent with Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, much evidence shows that children learn from positive and negative televised role models, and acquire norms and standards for conduct through media outlets such as television and video games. This is supported by a study by Cynthia Hoffner with children aged 7–12, which showed that the gender of children's favorite televised characters was strongly correlated to the gender of the children. Furthermore, the research showed "wishful identification" with parasocial relationships, namely, that boys preferred intelligence, while girls preferred attractiveness when picking favorite characters. These alternatives are both enhanced and mitigated by their separation from reality. 
On one hand, parasocial interactions are particularly appealing to adolescents in the throes of identity formation and increasing autonomy from parents because these relationships provide idealized figures with whom the adolescent can envision total acceptance. The lack of actual contact with these idealized figures can offer positive social interactions without risk of rejection or consequent feelings of unworthiness. One cannot know everything about a media figure or icon, allowing adolescents to attach fantasized attributes onto these figures in order to meet their own specific wants or needs. On the other hand, entities far removed from reality tend to be less influential on children.

A study by Rosaen and Dibble examined correlation between realism of favorite television character and strength of parasocial relationships. Results showed a positive correlation between social realism (how realistic the character is) and strength of parasocial relationships. Results also show age-related differences among children. Older children tended to prefer more realistic characters, while younger children generally had more powerful parasocial relationships with any character. Age, however, did not impact the correlation between social realism and strength of parasocial interaction, which suggests that more real characters are grounds for more powerful parasocial relationships in children of all ages.

=== Learning through the media ===

The ability to learn from parasocial relationships is directly correlated to the strength of the relationship, as has been shown in work by [[Sandra L. Calvert]] and colleagues. In a study by Lauricella, Gola, and Calvert (2011), eight 21-month-old infants were taught seriation sequencing by one of two characters. One character, Elmo, is iconic in American culture and therefore socially meaningful, and the other, DoDo, although popular with children in Taiwan, is less well known in American media. Children were better able to learn from the socially meaningful character (Elmo) than from the character who was less easily recognized (DoDo). Furthermore, children could become better able to learn from less socially-relevant characters such as DoDo, by developing a parasocial relationship with that character. Accordingly, after children were given DoDo toys to play with, their ability to learn from that character increased. In a later study, this effect was found to be greatest when children showed stronger parasocial relationships: Children's success on the seriation task, and therefore their ability to learn from a less familiar character, was greatest for children who exhibited more emotional nurturing behaviors toward the DoDo toy during play (Gola, Richards, Lauricella, &amp; Calvert, 2013).

Personalization of a character makes a child more likely to nurture the character, and thus more likely to form a parasocial relationship that would improve learning from videos featuring the character (Calvert, Richards, &amp; Kent, 2014). In place of DoDo and Elmo, Calvert et al. (2014) gave children Scout and Violet dolls. These interactive plush toy dogs can be programmed to say a child's name and have particular favorites (i.e., a favorite food, color, and song). 18-month-old children were given either personalized toys ( matched for gender, programmed to say the child's name, and programmed to have the same favorites as the child) or non-personalized toys (the opposite gender, programmed to call the children "Pal" and have random favorites). At the end of the study, children who had received personalized dolls were better able to learn from their characters than were children who had received non-personalized toys. Children also nurtured personalized toys more than non-personalized toys. It seems that perceived similarities increase children's interest and investment in the characters, which motivates the development of parasocial relationships and helps improve later screen-based learning.

==Negative consequences in childhood==

In the past two decades, people have become increasingly interested in the potential negative impacts media has on people's' behavior and cognition. Many researchers have begun to look more closely at how people's relationships with various media outlets affect behavior, self-perception and attachment styles, and specifically in regards to creating parasocial relationships.

=== Body image ===

Further research has examined these relationships with regard to body image and self-perception. Interest in this more narrow area of research has increased as body image issues have become more prevalent in today's society.

A study was conducted to examine the relationship between media exposure and adolescents' body image. Specifically, researchers looked at parasocial relationships and the different motivations for self-comparison with a character. This study surveyed 391 7th and 8th grade students and found that media exposure negatively predicted body image. In addition to the direct negative impact, the study indicated that parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with characters amplified the negative effects on kids' body images. Furthermore, the researchers found that making social comparisons with favorite characters distorted actual, or ideal, body image and self-perception. Studies have been done exploring these effects across gender.

A study examined the parasocial relationships between men and superheroes; the study looked at muscular vs. non-muscular superheroes and men who either did or did not develop a one-sided psychological bond with a superhero character. The results from this study indicated a significant impact on body image, particularly when exposed to muscular superhero characters. The research found that men who formed a parasocial relationship with a muscular superhero had poor self-perception and felt negatively about their own bodies after exposure to the muscular character.

=== Aggression ===

Further studies have looked into parasocial relationships and more specifically at the impacts on violent and aggressive behavior. A study done by Keren Eyal and Alan M. Rubin examined aggressive and violent television characters and the potential negative impacts they may have on viewers. The study was based on social cognitive theory and looked at trait aggression in viewers and identification and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. The researchers measured trait aggression in each of the participants and compared that to the level of identification with aggressive characters.The study found that more aggressive viewers were more likely to identify with aggressive characters and further develop parasocial relationships with the aggressive characters.

Parasocial interaction has been linked to psychological [[attachment theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = T. | last2 = Leets | first2 = L. | year = 1999 | title = Attachment styles and intimate television viewing. Insecurely forming relationships in a parasocial way | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 495–511 | doi=10.1177/0265407599164005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its consequences have seen the same dramatic effects as real [[Relationship breakup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Parasocial break-up from favorite television characters: The role of attachment styles and relationship intensity | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 187–202 | doi=10.1177/0265407504041374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In considering the relationship between parasocial interaction and attachment styles, Cohen (2004) found that individuals who were more anxious media consumers tended to be more invested in parasocial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jonathan|title=Parasocial Break-Up from Favorite Television Characters: The Role of Attachment Styles and Relationship Intensity|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=1 April 2004|volume=21|issue=2|pages=187–202|doi=10.1177/0265407504041374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parasocial interaction there is no "normal" [[social interaction]]; it is a very one-sided relation. The knowledgeable side has no direct control over the actions of the side it observes, and it is very difficult for it to contact and influence it.

=== Parasocial breakup ===

While much research focuses on the formation and maintenance of parasocial relationships, other research has begun to focus on what happens when a parasocial relationship is dissolved. Eyal and Cohen define parasocial breakup as "a situation where a character with whom a viewer has developed a PSR goes off the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eyal|first1=K.|last2=Cohen|first2=J.|title=When Good "Friends" Say Goodbye: A Parasocial Breakup Study|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2006|volume=50|issue=3|pages=502–523|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem5003_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyal and Cohen (2006) found that the [[distress (medicine)|distress]] that media consumers experienced after a parasocial breakup was quite similar to that of a social relationship. However, the emotional distress experienced after the parasocial breakup was weaker than that of the real life interpersonal relationship. Lather and Moyer-Guse (2011) also considered the concept of parasocial breakup, but in a more temporary sense. While the study focused on parasocial breakups as a result of the writers' strike from 2007-2008, the researchers found that media consumers still experienced different levels of emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lather|first1=J.|last2=Moyer-Guse|first2=E.|title=How do we react when our favorite characters are taken away? An examination of a temporary parasocial breakup|journal=Mass Communication and Society|date=2011|volume=14|issue=2|pages=196–215|doi=10.1080/15205431003668603}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, like previous studies, showed that parasocial relationships operate very similarly to real-life relationships.

==On the Internet==
Though most literature has focused on parasocial interaction as a television and film phenomenon, new technologies, namely the [[Internet]], have necessitated a closer look at such interactions. The applications of PSI to computer-mediated environments are continuously documented in literature in last decade (Ballantine and Martin 2005; Goldberg and Allen 2008; Labrecque, 2014). Many researchers concluded that, just as parasocial relationships are present in television and radio, they are also present in online environments such as blogs and other [[social networking]] sites. Through an exploration of followers on politicians' blogs, Thorson and Rodgers (2006) found that parasocial interacting with the politician influences people's opinions about the politician, and promotes them to vote for the politician. Social media is designed to be a new channel through which parasocial interaction/relationship can be formed. Research has shown that interacting with individuals through blogs and social media such as Twitter can influence the perceptions of those individuals (Thorson &amp; Rodgers, 2006; Frederick, et al., 2012). As Internet users become more active on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, followers often feel more engaged with them, making the parasocial relationships stronger.

In 1998, John Eighmey, from [[Iowa State University]], and Lola McCord, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the [[World Wide Web]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296397000611 |title=Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the World Wide Web |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=187–194 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-03-26 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(97)00061-1|year=1998 |last1=Eighmey |first1=John |last2=McCord |first2=Lola }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, they observed that the presence of parasocial relationships constituted an important determinant of [[Website visitor tracking|website visitation rates]]. "It appears," the study states, "that websites projecting a strong sense of personality may also encourage the development of a kind of parasocial relationship with website visitors."

In 1999, John Hoerner, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Scaling the Web: A Parasocial Interaction Scale for World Wide Web Sites",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Df2BgZD9lxQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=scaling+the+web:+a+parasocial+Interaction+Scale+for+World+Wide+Web+Sites | title = Advertising and the World Wide Web | isbn = 9781410602060 |last1=Schumann |first1=David W |first2=Esther |last2=Thorson |date=1999-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a method for measuring the effects of parasocial interaction on the Internet. The study explained that [[website]]s may feature "personae" that host to the visitors to the sites in order to generate public interest. Personae, in some cases, are nothing more than the online representations of the actual people, often prominent public figures, but sometimes, according to the study, will be the fictional creations of the sites' webmasters. Personae "take on many of the characteristics of a [real-life] companion, including regular and frequent appearances, a sense of immediacy...and the feeling of a face-to-face meeting." Additionally, the study makes the point that, even when no such personae have been created, parasocial relationships might still develop. Webmasters might foster parasocial interactions through a conversational writing style, extensive character development and opportunities for email exchange with the website's persona.

Hoerner used the Parasocial Interaction (PSI) scale, developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell (1985), and modified the scale to more accurately assess parasocial interactions on the Internet. They used the scale to gauge participants' reactions to a number of different websites, and, more generally, to determine whether or not parasocial interaction theory could be linked to Internet use. The study concluded, first, that parasocial interaction is not dependent on the presence of a traditional persona on a website; data showed that websites with described "strong personae" did not attract significantly more hits than other websites selected by the study conductors. "The literal, mediated personality from the newscast or soap opera of the past [around which the original PSI-scale was framed] is gone. The design metaphor, flow of the web experience, and styles of textual and graphic presentations of the information all become elements of a website persona and encourage parasocial interaction by the visitor/user with that persona."

The study also confirmed the accuracy of the "PSI web scale" as a way to gauge consumer parasocial interaction with websites.

Social media is defined as "Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|date=2010|title=Users of the world, unite!

In recent years, companies and brands have taken this opportunity to use celebrities to aide in impacting such key elements of the company-consumer relationship as brand image and brand awareness (Jansen et al. 2009). For example, Katy Perry currently serves as the top most followed individual on Twitter for having over 109 million followers. The more followers one has on Twitter,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Twitter|date=2018-06-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter&amp;oldid=847306583|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the greater perceived social influence one has. This is particularly because tweets are broadcast to each and every follower,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=List of most-followed Twitter accounts|date=2018-06-20|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts&amp;oldid=846649014|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may then retweet these posts on their own profiles, which are then rebroadcast to thousands of other Twitter members (Schaefer 2012; Scott 2011). It is no coincidence that to be "trending" (i.e., phrases or topics that are tagged at a greater rate than others) on Twitter at any given point in time is equivalent to having one's movie become a box-office hit or one's hit single rank on the Billboard chart; in other words, Twitter can be utilized as a form of social capital (Jin 2013; Li and Bernoff 2011; Putnam 2000).

In a 2014 journal article Seung-A Annie Jin and Joe Phua discussed how they conducted studies to determine multiple hypothesis based on the number of followers a celebrity had in correlation to the trust that imparted onto a consumer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Seung-A Annie|last2=Phua|first2=Joe|date=2014-04-03|title=Following Celebrities' Tweets About Brands: The Impact of Twitter-Based Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Consumers' Source Credibility Perception, Buying Intention, and Social Identification With Celebrities|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.827606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was done in terms of a celebrity endorsing a product and the consumer's likely to purchase the product after seeing the promotion. Consumers perceived the celebrity with a high number of followers as being more physically attractive, trustworthy, and competent. A high number of followers on the celebrity endorser's profile also significantly increased consumers' intention to build an online friendship with the celebrity. The study found that if a celebrity with a higher number of followers was found to be more trustworthy and the consumer exhibited significantly higher postexposure product involvement and buying intention as opposed to those who were exposed to a celebrity with a lower follower count.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Social media networks inherit at least one key attribute from the Internet, in that they offer open accessibility for all users. Philip Drake and Andy Miah argue that the Internet, and therefore social networks and blogs, downsize the gatekeeping processes that exist in other mass media forms. They further state that this means that online information can spread unfiltered and thus does not rest on strict framework conditions such as those on television or in newspapers. This, however, remains subject to an ongoing debate within research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Philip|last2=Miah|first2=Andy|date=2010-03-01|title=The Cultural Politics of Celebrity|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/cultural-politics/article-abstract/6/1/49/8002/The-Cultural-Politics-of-Celebrity|journal=Cultural Politics|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=49–64|doi=10.2752/175174310X12549254318746|issn=1743-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/apps/doc/A244276463/PPCM?u=tusc49521&amp;sid=PPCM&amp;xid=3bee8234|title=E-Resource Login|website=link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through presence on social media platforms, stars and celebrities attempt on the one hand to participate in the production of their image; on the other hand, they must remain present in these media in order to stay on the media’s and consequently on the audience’s agenda.

Most celebrities, aware of the rising importance of social media (for their audience), now themselves actively use these networks, by running their own profiles and making raw and real-time information and content available to the social media community and fans. It allows them to promote themselves and their “products” (i.e. music, albums, movies, shows) by directly communicating with their audience. Nowadays a fan can more easily to get “in touch” with celebrities (as fan mails don’t need to be hand-written and sent though regular mail anymore) by way of comments on photos or videos posted by the celebrity themselves. Often, and dependent upon the celebrity and their personal management of their social profiles, the celebrity may respond to a comment of a random fan or follow. The development of parasocial relationships between the audience/fans and celebrities is facilitated. The process also calls into question the one-way nature of parasocial interaction because celebrities, on the outer surface seem to try to get more and more in contact with their audiences. Researchers now raise the question of how social media, i.e., social networks, have modified these parasocial interactions between the celebrities and their audience.

==Future research==

One direction for future PSI concerns the advancement of methodology. As theories become more defined and complex, experiments seem to be necessary to be employed in testing hypotheses. Because the meanings of perception and emotion take up much of what parasocial interaction/relationship research interest, the cause and effect is hard to be distinguished and potential spuriousness is difficult to be avoided (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014). For example, whether similarity precedes PSI and whether mediated interaction create a sense of similarity requires experimental validation (Murphy, Frank, Moran, &amp; Patnoe-Woodley, 2011).

Cohen (2001) also suggested that different types of relationships are encouraged to be analyzed by different genres, which particularly challenges scholars in examine the mediated relationship in those reality TVs (e.g., Survivor) (Nabi, Stitt, Halford, &amp; Finnerty. 2006). These prototypical reality shows which are built around narratives, displaying a lot of emotions which seem to invite [[empathy]] and identification, and also demonstrating the characters' skills as to develop [[fandom]]. Ratings and audience responses provide strong evidence that those reality shows create significant mediated relationship, but future inquiries should examine whether this new kind of mediated interaction/relationship evolves or do these interactions/relationships conform to existing patterns (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014).

The influence of media in childhood has received little attention from [[developmental psychologist]]s, even though children have a high degree of exposure to media. While many studies and experiments have explored the nature of parasocial relationships, there are many opportunities for future research. For example, a potential future area of research could be the issue of reruns, where the relationships have outcomes which are already known or well-established. In addition, another area of research could focus on production techniques or televisual approaches. This would include techniques such as chiaroscuro or flat lighting, the strategic placement of close-ups or establishing shots, deductive or inductive shot sequences, hip hop editing, or desaturation. These techniques have long been theorized to have some sort of influence on the formation of parasocial relationships, but their influence has yet to be determined.

The prevailing use of social media and its impact on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Branch, Wilson, &amp; Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense (Labrecque, 2014). As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Baek, Bae, and Jang (2013) also mentioned that technological development have been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means that we spend more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration (Labrecque, 2014).

Other concerns include the continuity of media figures representation across various media outlets, and the notion of parasocial interaction as compensation for lack of social outlets. Popstars, for example, may not only appear on television, but on several different television or radio programs, as either a chat guest or a performer; further repeated viewings of these stars would intensify visual aspects of parasocial interaction with that star. Most research has typically characterized media users as a television viewer who is often solitary and in need of social interaction. The different types of user-figure interaction can be addressed by conceptualizing parasocial interaction as an extension of ordinary social interaction. Through close examination of social encounters that are significant for parasocial relationships, we can continue to distinguish between parasocial interaction an isolated activity and longer-term interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13114">The '''Perger-Verzeichnis''' ("Perger Catalogue") is a thematic-chronological catalogue of instrumental compositions by [[Michael Haydn]], compiled by Lothar Perger in 1907. Like Ludwig von Köchel's catalog of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s compositions (the [[Köchel-Verzeichnis]]), Perger's catalog uses a single range of numbers, from 1 to 136, but like Hoboken's catalog of Joseph Haydn's music, groups the pieces first into categories (symphonies, concertos, etc.) and then sorts them chronologically.

Perger's attempt at figuring out the chronology is, however, so full of mistakes (including the attribution to Haydn of music by others) that later musicologists, instead of trying to amend the catalog (as they have with Köchel's) have created new ones from scratch. The most credible is the one by Charles Sherman and T. Donley Thomas, a chronological catalog of 838 pieces in which each piece is assigned an MH number in that range according to their best guesses at chronology.

Even so, Perger's catalog is still widely used by libraries, music publishing houses and some record companies.

For a more complete listing of Michael Haydn's instrumental and vocal music, see [[list of compositions by Michael Haydn]]. The following list only includes those pieces with a Perger number, even when they're not by Haydn. See also [[Klafsky-Verzeichnis]].
&lt;!-- If I've done this correctly, the Perger numbers run from 1 to 136 in order and the MH numbers run according to second column in the table on page 385 of Sherman &amp; Thomas (1993) --&gt;

== Symphonies ==

Perger numbered the symphonies from 1 to 52, but he included suites from incidental music by Haydn compiled into symphonies by someone else, as well as three symphonies altogether written by others. However, Perger overlooked a divertimento in G major that is sometimes called a symphony.

* Suite from ''Die Wahrheit der Natur'', MH 118, Perger 46 (1769?), sometimes called a symphony in F major&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (1982): lvii. "Although this work (Perger 45 [46 is meant here]) is derived from a separate larger composition, as are the six symphonies described above [No.s 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20], its form and its proportions call its authenticity into question. The Seitenstetten symphony opens with a substantial movement in sonata style followed by three short numbers. Two of these are minuets with trio&amp;mdash;a combination of movements that occurs in no other symphony by Haydn. So curious a sequence of movements appears all the more dubious in as much as ''Die Wahrheit der Natur'' contains a true finale, which most likely Haydn would have maintained for its character and its length had he himself compiled this symphony. The Seitenstetten work, therefore, is omitted from the list of authentic symphonies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Suite from ''Rebekka als Braut'', MH 76, Perger 47 (1766)
* A symphony by someone else, Perger 48
* A symphony by someone else, Perger 49
* A symphony by [[Georg Christoph Wagenseil]], Perger 50&lt;ref name="larsen"&gt;Jens Peter Larsen, "Haydn und das &gt;&gt;kleine Quartbuch&lt;&lt;" ''Acta Musicologica'', Vol. 7, Fasc. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1935), p. 121, n. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Symphony No. 4 (Michael Haydn)|Symphony No. 4 in B-flat major]], MH  62, Perger 51 (1763)
* [[Symphony No. 14 (Michael Haydn)|Symphony No. 14 in B flat major]], MH 133, Perger 52 (1771)

== Concertos ==

Perger overlooked a violin concerto in G major, MH 52, while the horn concerto he placed in a miscellaneous category at the end.

* Violin Concerto in B-flat major, MH 36, Perger 53
* Flute Concerto No. 1 in D major, MH 81, Perger 54
* Concerto in C major for Organ and Viola, MH 41, Perger 55

== Minuets ==

For the most part these are collections of minuets that can be played on their own. Because Haydn wrote a minuet to symphony No. 33 long after the rest of the symphony, Perger mixed this minuet up with the free-standing pieces.

* 6 Menuetti, Perger 69, MH 333
* 6 Menuetti, Perger 70, MH 354

* Divertimento in D major, Perger 95, MH 418
* Divertimento in G major, Perger 96, MH 518

* Divertimento à 3 in C major, Perger 98, MH 179
* Divertimento à 3 in C major, Perger 99, MH 27

* String Quartet in B flat major, Perger 124, MH 308
* String Quartet in B flat major, Perger 125, MH 316

==Sonatas==

[[Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo]] commissioned Haydn to write six duos for violin and viola. Haydn fell ill after completing the fourth, so he asked Mozart to write the other two (K. 423 and K. 424). The set of six was presented as all Haydn's, and Colloredo was unable to "detect in them Mozart's obvious workmanship."&lt;ref&gt;John N. Burk, ''Mozart and His Music''. New York: Random House (1959): 140&lt;/ref&gt; With these Perger lumped a sonata for two violins and organ.

* Sonata for 2 violins &amp; organ in B flat major, Perger 126 (lost), MH Appendix 9
* Duo for violin and viola in C major, Perger 127, MH 335
* Duo for violin and viola in D major, Perger 128, MH 336

A '''Possum belly''', on a [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]], is a metal container at the head of the [[shale shaker]] that receives the flow of [[drilling fluid]] and is directly connected to and at the end of the [[flow line]]. A possum belly may also be referred to as a distribution box or flowline trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinner|first=Les|title=Oilfield jargon|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3159/is_9_226/ai_n15649426/|work=World Oil|accessdate=25 July 2010|date=Sep 2005}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the possum belly is to slow the flow of the [[drilling fluid]] (after it has gained momentum from coming down through the [[flow line]]) so that it does not shoot off of the [[shale shaker]]s.

Possum bellies are generally used when [[bentonite]] or another form of "mud" is being used. During the use of [[freshwater]] or [[brine water]], the [[flow line]] generally either goes straight to the reserve pit, or into the [[steel pits]].

The possum belly derives its name from the similarity of its appearance to the underbelly of the female [[opossum|possum]]. Each of the chambers of the possum belly resemble an elongated teat similar to the ones found on female possums.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram.

See [[glossary of psychiatry]].

Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a [[Medical history|case history]] and [[mental status examination]]. Physical examinations and [[Psychological testing|psychological tests]] may be conducted. On occasion, [[neuroimaging]] or other [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] techniques are used.&lt;ref name=NIMHSite/&gt; Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD), edited and used by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the widely used ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]) was published in 2013 which re-organized the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current research.&lt;ref name=Kupfer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kupfer DJ, Regier DA | title = Why all of medicine should care about DSM-5 | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19 | pages = 1974–5 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20483976 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please see Talk page for discussion about the last paragraph of this lead section. --&gt;
The combined treatment of [[psychiatric medication]] and [[psychotherapy]] has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabbard GO | title = Psychotherapy in psychiatry | journal = International Review of Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–12 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17365154 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1080/09540260601080813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., [[assertive community treatment]], [[Community reinforcement approach and family training|community reinforcement]], and [[supported employment]]. Treatment may be delivered on an [[inpatient]] or [[outpatient]] basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. An inpatient may be treated in a [[psychiatric hospital]]. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis, e.g., with [[epidemiologists]], [[mental health counselor]]s, [[Nursing|nurses]], [[psychologists]], public health specialists, [[Radiology|radiologists]], and/or [[social workers]].

==Etymology==
[[File:American Lady Against The Sky.jpg|thumb|The word ''[[wiktionary:psyche|psyche]]'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for [[soul]] or [[butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Rabuzzi|first1=Matthew|title=Butterfly Etymology|magazine=Cultural Entomology Digest|issue=4|url=http://www.insects.org/ced4/etymology.html|date=November 1997 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 December 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203024144/http://www.insects.org/ced4/etymology.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluttering insect appears in the [[coat of arms]] of Britain's [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = James FE | date = July 1991 | title = Psyche | journal = Psychiatric Bulletin|volume=15|issue=7|pages=429–31|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/15/7/429 | doi = 10.1192/pb.15.7.429 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term "psychiatry" was first coined by the German [[physician]] [[Johann Christian Reil]] in 1808 and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (''[[Wikt:psych|psych-]]'' "soul" from [[Ancient Greek]] ''psykhē'' "soul"; ''[[Wikt:-iatry|-iatry]]'' "medical treatment" from Gk. ''iātrikos'' "medical" from ''iāsthai'' "to heal"). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a [[psychiatrist]]. (For a historical overview, see [[Timeline of psychiatry]].)

==Theory and focus==
{{quote box
| quote = "Psychiatry, more than any other branch of medicine, forces its practitioners to wrestle with the nature of evidence, the validity of introspection, problems in communication, and other long-standing philosophical issues" &lt;small&gt;([[Psychiatry#cite note-Guze4-5|Guze, 1992, p.4]]).&lt;/small&gt;

}}

Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the [[mind]], aiming to [[Medical research|study]], [[Preventive healthcare|prevent]], and [[treatment of mental disorders|treat]] [[mental disorder]]s in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=Guze4&gt;{{harvnb|Guze|1992|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storrow1&gt;{{cite book |last=Storrow |first=Hugh A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1969 |title=Outline of Clinical Psychiatry |location=New York |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |page=1 |isbn=978-0-390-85075-1 |oclc=599349242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lyness|1997|p=3}} It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.{{sfn|Gask|2004|p=7}}

People who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other [[mental health professional]]s and [[physician]]s in that they must be familiar with both the [[social science|social]] and [[biology|biological sciences]].&lt;ref name=Storrow1/&gt; The discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient. {{sfn|Guze|1992|p=131}} Psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally divided into three very general categories: [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]], severe learning disabilities, and [[personality disorder]]s.{{sfn|Gask|2004|p=113}} While the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the late 20th century the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields.{{sfn|Gask|2004|p=128}}

Though the medical specialty of psychiatry uses research in the field of [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[pharmacology]],&lt;ref name=Pietrini&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pietrini P | title = Toward a biochemistry of mind? | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 11 | pages = 1907–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14594732 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1907 | doi-access = free | department = Editorial }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has generally been considered a middle ground between [[neurology]] and psychology.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=326}} Because psychiatry and neurology are deeply intertwined medical specialties, all certification for both specialties and for their subspecialties is offered by a single board, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, one of the member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Specialty and Subspecialty Certificates |date=n.d.|website=American Board of Medical Specialties |url=http://www.abms.org/member-boards/specialty-subspecialty-certificates/|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other physicians and neurologists, psychiatrists specialize in the [[doctor–patient relationship]] and are trained to varying extents in the use of psychotherapy and other therapeutic communication techniques.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=326}} Psychiatrists also differ from psychologists in that they are physicians and have post-graduate training called residency (usually 4 to 5 years) in psychiatry; the quality and thoroughness of their graduate medical training is identical to that of all other physicians.&lt;ref name=Hauser&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hauser|first1=Mark J.|title=Student Information|url=http://www.psychiatry.com/student.php|website=Psychiatry.com|access-date=21 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023095258/http://www.psychiatry.com/student.php|archive-date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists can therefore counsel patients, prescribe medication, order [[medical laboratory|laboratory test]]s, order [[neuroimaging]], and conduct [[physical examination]]s.&lt;ref name=NIMHSite&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |date=January 31, 2006 |title=Information about Mental Illness and the Brain (Page 3 of 3) |website=The Science of Mental Illness |access-date=April 19, 2007 |url=http://science-education.nih.gov/supplements/nih5/Mental/guide/info-mental-c.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140052/http://science-education.nih.gov/supplements/nih5/Mental/guide/info-mental-c.htm |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
{{See also|Ethical issues in psychiatry (disambiguation)}}
Like other purveyors of [[professional ethics]], the [[World Psychiatric Association]] issues an [[ethical code]] to govern the conduct of psychiatrists. The psychiatric code of ethics, first set forth through the Declaration of Hawaii in 1977, has been expanded through a 1983 Vienna update and, in 1996, the broader Madrid Declaration. The code was further revised during the organization's general assemblies in 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2011.&lt;ref name=WPAethics&gt;{{cite web|date=21 September 2011 |title=Madrid Declaration on Ethical Standards for Psychiatric Practice|url=http://wpanet.org/detail.php?section_id=5&amp;content_id=48|website=World Psychiatric Association|access-date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Psychiatric Association code covers such matters as patient assessment, up-to-date knowledge, the [[dignity|human dignity]] of incapacitated patients, [[confidentiality]], research ethics, sex selection, [[euthanasia]],&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Muñoz F, Alamo C, Dudley M, Rubio G, García-García P, Molina JD, Okasha A | title = Psychiatry and political-institutional abuse from the historical perspective: the ethical lessons of the Nuremberg Trial on their 60th anniversary | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 791–806 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17223241 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.12.007 | quote = These practices, in which racial hygiene constituted one of the fundamental principles and euthanasia programmes were the most obvious consequence, violated the majority of known bioethical principles.

In establishing such ethical codes, the profession has responded to a number of controversies about the practice of psychiatry, for example, surrounding the use of [[lobotomy]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Discredited psychiatrists who operated outside the norms of [[medical ethics]] include [[Harry Bailey]], [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[Henry Cotton (doctor)|Henry Cotton]], and [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]].&lt;ref name=Kirk2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=Stuart A. |last2=Gomory |first2=Tomi |last3=Cohen |first3=David | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, NJ |oclc=935892629 |isbn=978-1-4128-4976-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}

===Approaches===
Psychiatric illnesses can be conceptualised in a number of different ways. The [[biomedical model|biomedical]] approach examines signs and symptoms and compares them with diagnostic criteria. Mental illness can be assessed, conversely, through a narrative which tries to incorporate symptoms into a meaningful life history and to frame them as responses to external conditions. Both approaches are important in the field of psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verhulst J, Tucker G | title = Medical and narrative approaches in psychiatry | journal = Psychiatric Services | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–4 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7627683 | doi = 10.1176/ps.46.5.513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have not sufficiently reconciled to settle [[biopsychiatry controversy|controversy]] over either the selection of a psychiatric [[paradigm]] or the specification of [[psychopathology]]. The notion of a "[[biopsychosocial model]]" is often used to underline the multifactorial nature of clinical impairment.&lt;ref name="McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLaren_madness"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Humanizing Madness| last = McLaren |first = Niall |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-1-932690-39-2 |pages = |publisher = Loving Healing Press |location = Ann Arbor, MI}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLaren_psychiatry"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Humanizing Psychiatry |last = McLaren |first = Niall |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-1-61599-011-5 |pages = |publisher = Loving Healing Press |location = Ann Arbor, MI}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this notion the word "model" is not used in a strictly scientific way though.&lt;ref name="McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6" /&gt; Alternatively, a [[Niall McLaren#Humanizing Psychiatry|"biocognitive model"]] acknowledges the physiological basis for the mind's existence, but identifies [[cognition]] as an [[Antireductionism|irreducible]] and independent realm in which disorder may occur.&lt;ref name="McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McLaren_madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLaren_psychiatry"/&gt; The biocognitive approach includes a [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] [[etiology]] and provides a natural [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] (i.e. non-spiritual) revision of the biopsychosocial view, reflecting the efforts of [[Australians|Australian]] psychiatrist [[Niall McLaren]] to bring the discipline into scientific maturity in accordance with the paradigmatic standards of [[Philosophy of science|philosopher]] [[Thomas Kuhn]].&lt;ref name="McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLaren N | title = A critical review of the biopsychosocial model | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–92; discussion 93–6 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9565189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1614.1998.00343.x | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "McLaren_madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLaren_psychiatry"/&gt;

Once a medical professional diagnoses a patient there are numerous ways that they could choose to treat the patient. Often psychiatrists will develop a treatment strategy that incorporates different facets of different approaches into one. Drug prescriptions are very commonly written to be regimented to patients along with any therapy they receive. There are three major pillars of psychotherapy that treatment strategies are most regularly drawn from. [[Humanistic psychology]] attempts to put the "whole" of the patient in perspective; it also focuses on self exploration.&lt;ref name="humanistic"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Hurst | name-list-format = vanc |title=Humanistic Therapy |website=CRC Health Group. |access-date=29 March 2015 |url=http://www.crchealth.com/types-of-therapy/what-is-humanistic-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviorism]] is a therapeutic school of thought that elects to focus solely on real and observable events, rather than mining the unconscious or ''subconscious''. [[Psychoanalysis]], on the other hand, concentrates its dealings on early childhood, irrational drives, the unconscious, and conflict between conscious and unconscious streams.&lt;ref name="psychoanalysis"&gt;{{cite web |first=Saul |last=McLeod | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014 |title=Psychoanalysis |website=Simply Psychology |access-date=29 March 2015 |url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practitioners===
{{Main article|Psychiatrist}}
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
All [[physician]]s can diagnose mental disorders and prescribe treatments utilizing principles of psychiatry. [[Psychiatrist]]s are trained physicians who specialize in psychiatry and are certified to treat [[mental illness]]. They may treat outpatients, inpatients, or both; they may practice as solo practitioners or as members of groups; they may be self-employed, be members of partnerships, or be employees of governmental, academic, nonprofit, or for-profit entities; employees of hospitals; they may treat military personnel as civilians or as members of the military; and in any of these settings they may function as clinicians, researchers, teachers, or some combination of these. Although psychiatrists may also go through significant training to conduct [[psychotherapy]], [[psychoanalysis]] or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], it is their training as physicians that differentiates them from other [[mental health professional]]s.

===As a career choice===
Psychiatry was not a popular career choice among medical students, even though medical school placements are rated favorably.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown M, Barnes J, Silver K, Williams N, Newton PM | title = The Educational Impact of Exposure to Clinical Psychiatry Early in an Undergraduate Medical Curriculum | journal = Academic Psychiatry | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 274–81 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26077010 | doi = 10.1007/s40596-015-0358-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a significant shortage of psychiatrists in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Japsen | name-list-format = vanc |date=15 September 2015 |title=Psychiatrist Shortage Worsens Amid 'Mental Health Crisis' |website=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2015/09/15/psychiatrist-shortage-worsens-amid-mental-health-crisis/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies to address this shortfall have included the use of short 'taster' placements early in the medical school curriculum &lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt; and attempts to extend psychiatry services further using [[telemedicine]] technologies and other methods.&lt;ref name=THIELE&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thiele JS, Doarn CR, Shore JH | title = Locum tenens and telepsychiatry: trends in psychiatric care | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-Health | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 510–3 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25764147 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2014.0159 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, however, there has been an increase in the number of medical students entering into a psychiatry residency. There are several reasons for this surge including the interesting nature of the field, growing interest in genetic biomarkers involved in psychiatric diagnoses, and newer pharmaceuticals on the drug market to treat psychiatric illnesses. &lt;ref&gt;https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2015.4b15&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Diagnostic systems===
{{see also|Diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry}}
[[Psychiatric assessment|Psychiatric diagnoses]] take place in a wide variety of settings and are performed by many different [[health care provider|health professionals]]. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a [[differential diagnosis]] procedure where a [[mental status examination]] and physical examination is conducted, with [[pathological]], [[psychopathological]] or [[psychosocial]] histories obtained, and sometimes [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]] or other [[neurophysiological]] measurements are taken, or [[personality test]]s or [[cognitive test]]s administered.&lt;ref name=Meyendorf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyendorf R | title = [Diagnosis and differential diagnosis in psychiatry and the question of situation referred prognostic diagnosis] | language = German | journal = Schweizer Archiv Fur Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie = Archives Suisses de Neurologie, Neurochirurgie et de Psychiatrie | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–34 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7414302 | trans-title = Diagnosis and differential diagnosis in psychiatry and the question of situation referred prognostic diagnosis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leigh|first=Hoyle| name-list-format = vanc |date=1983|title=Psychiatry in the practice of medicine|location=Menlo Park, CA |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-05456-9 |pages=15, 17, 67 |oclc=869194520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lyness|1997|p=10}}&lt;ref name=Hampel&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hampel H, Teipel SJ, Kötter HU, Horwitz B, Pfluger T, Mager T, Möller HJ, Müller-Spahn F | title = [Structural magnetic resonance tomography in diagnosis and research of Alzheimer type dementia] | language = German | journal = Der Nervenarzt | volume = 68 | issue = 5 | pages = 365–78 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9280846 | doi = 10.1007/s001150050138 | trans-title = Structural magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis and research of Alzheimer's disease }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Townsend |first1=Brent A. |last2=Petrella |first2=Jeffrey R. |last3=Doraiswamy |first3=P.

===Diagnostic manuals===
{{See also|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders}}
Three main diagnostic manuals used to classify mental health conditions are in use today. The [[ICD-10]] is produced and published by the [[World Health Organization]], includes a section on psychiatric conditions, and is used worldwide.&lt;ref name=ICD10&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organisation |date=1992 |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=978-92-4-154422-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], produced and published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], is primarily focused on mental health conditions and is the main classification tool in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=DSM &gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |date=2000 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its fifth revised edition and is also used worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt; The [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] has also produced a diagnostic manual, the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YF | title = Chinese classification of mental disorders (CCMD-3): towards integration in international classification | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 35 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 171–5 | date = March–June 2002 | pmid = 12145505 | doi = 10.1159/000065140 | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated intention of diagnostic manuals is typically to develop replicable and clinically useful categories and criteria, to facilitate consensus and agreed upon standards, whilst being atheoretical as regards etiology.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Essen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Essen-Möller |first=Eric | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 1961 | title = On classification of mental disorders | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 37 | issue =2 | pages = 119–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1961.tb06163.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the categories are nevertheless based on particular psychiatric theories and data; they are broad and often specified by numerous possible combinations of symptoms, and many of the categories overlap in symptomology or typically occur together.&lt;ref name=Mezzich&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mezzich JE | title = Patterns and issues in multiaxial psychiatric diagnosis | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–37 | date = February 1979 | pmid = 370861 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700021632 | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally intended only as a guide for experienced clinicians trained in its use, the nomenclature is now widely used by clinicians, administrators and insurance companies in many countries.&lt;ref name=Guze2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guze SB | title = The need for toughmindedness in psychiatric thinking | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 662–71 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 5446229 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-197006000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM has attracted praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an [[unscientific]] system that enshrines the opinions of a few powerful psychiatrists. There are ongoing issues concerning the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial [[symptoms]]; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from '[[Normality (behavior)|normality]]'; possible [[cultural]] bias; [[medicalization]] of human distress and financial [[conflicts of interest]], including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the [[pharmaceutical industry]]; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; and the experience of those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the [[consumer/survivor movement]].&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalal PK, Sivakumar T | title = Moving towards ICD-11 and DSM-V: Concept and evolution of psychiatric classification | journal = Indian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 310–9 | date = October–December 2009 | pmid = 20048461 | pmc = 2802383 | doi = 10.4103/0019-5545.58302 | url = http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2009/51/4/310/58302 | doi-access = free }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kendell R, Jablensky A | title = Distinguishing between the validity and utility of psychiatric diagnoses | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–12 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12505793 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.4 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baca-Garcia E, Perez-Rodriguez MM, Basurte-Villamor I, Fernandez del Moral AL, Jimenez-Arriero MA, Gonzalez de Rivera JL, Saiz-Ruiz J, Oquendo MA | title = Diagnostic stability of psychiatric disorders in clinical practice | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 190 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–6 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17329740 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.024026 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/3/210 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pincus HA, Zarin DA, First M | title = "Clinical significance" and DSM-IV | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1145; author reply 1147–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9862559 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.55.12.1145 | url = http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=204490 | url-access = subscription | department = Letters to the Editor }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, now makes APA over $5 million a year, historically adding up to over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/opinion/the-dsms-troubled-revision.html |newspaper=The New York Times |department=The Opinion Pages | first=Gary | last=Greenberg | name-list-format = vanc | title=The D.S.M.'s Troubled Revision | date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General considerations===
[[File:NIMH Clinical Center.JPG|right|thumb|NIMH federal agency patient room for Psychiatric research, Maryland, USA.]]
Individuals with mental health conditions are commonly referred to as ''[[patient]]s'' but may also be called ''[[customer|client]]s'', ''[[consumer]]s'', or ''service recipients''. They may come under the care of a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self-[[Wikt:referral|referral]] or referral by a primary-care physician. Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by [[court order]], [[involuntary commitment]], or, in the UK and Australia, by [[sectioning]] under a [[mental health law]].

Persons who undergo a [[psychiatric assessment]] are evaluated by a [[psychiatrist]] for their mental and physical condition. This usually involves interviewing the person and often obtaining information from other sources such as other health and social care professionals, relatives, associates, law enforcement personnel, emergency medical personnel, and [[List of diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry|psychiatric rating scales]]. A [[mental status examination]] is carried out, and a [[physical examination]] is usually performed to establish or exclude other illnesses that may be contributing to the alleged psychiatric problems.  A physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of [[self-harm]]; this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist, especially if [[blood test]]s and [[medical imaging]] are performed.

Like most medications, psychiatric medications can cause [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] in patients, and some require ongoing [[therapeutic drug monitoring]], for instance [[full blood count]]s [[blood plasma|serum]] drug levels, renal function, liver function, and/or thyroid function. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is sometimes administered for serious and disabling conditions, such as those unresponsive to medication. The efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moncrieff J, Wessely S, Hardy R | title = Active placebos versus antidepressants for depression | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD003012 | date = 26 January 2004 | pmid = 14974002 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003012.pub2 | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopper K, Wanderling J | title = Revisiting the developed versus developing country distinction in course and outcome in schizophrenia: results from ISoS, the WHO collaborative followup project.

For many years, controversy has surrounded the use of involuntary treatment and use of the term "lack of insight" in describing patients. Mental health laws vary significantly among jurisdictions, but in many cases, involuntary psychiatric treatment is permitted when there is deemed to be a risk to the patient or others due to the patient's illness. Involuntary treatment refers to treatment that occurs based on the treating physician's recommendations without requiring consent from the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unzicker|first1=Rae E.|author-link1=Rae Unzicker|last2=Wolters|first2=Kate P.|last3=Robinson|first3=Debra | name-list-format = vanc |title=From Privileges to Rights: People Labeled with Psychiatric Disabilities Speak for Themselves|url=http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2000/privileges.htm|website=[[National Council on Disability]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228231912/http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2000/privileges.htm|archive-date=28 December 2010|date=20 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inpatient treatment===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
[[Treatment of mental illness|Psychiatric treatments]] have changed over the past several decades. In the past, psychiatric patients were often [[psychiatric hospital|hospitalized]] for six months or more, with some cases involving hospitalization for many years. Today in most countries, people receiving psychiatric treatment are more likely to be seen as [[general out-patient clinic|outpatients]]. If hospitalization is required, the average hospital stay is around one to two weeks, with only a small number receiving long-term hospitalization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.  However, in Japan psychiatric hospitals continue to keep patients for long periods, sometimes even keeping them in [[physical restraints]], strapped to their beds for periods of weeks or months &lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/05/09/national/science-health/tying-mental-health-patients-soaring/#.WkGKhMgjFPY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;長谷川利夫. (2016). 精神科医療における隔離・ 身体拘束実態調査 ～その急増の背景要因を探り縮減への道筋を考える～. 病院・地域精神医学, 59(1), 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Psychiatric inpatients are people admitted to a hospital or clinic to receive psychiatric care. Some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps committed to a secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system. In many countries including the USA and Canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. They may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves and/or others. Bed availability is often the real determinant of admission decisions to hard pressed public facilities. European Human Rights legislation restricts detention to medically certified cases of mental disorder, and adds a right to timely judicial review of detention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

People may be admitted voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety isn't compromised by this less restrictive option. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those thought to have a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once in the care of a hospital, people are [[psychiatric assessment|assessed]], monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric nurses]], clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision, and may be put in [[physical restraints]] or medicated. People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied or on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Acute inpatient psychiatric care: A source book | publisher = World Health Organisation | location = Darlinghurst, Australia | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-9578073-1-0 | oclc = 223935527 | author = Treatment Protocol Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developed countries there has been a massive reduction in psychiatric beds since the mid 20th century, with the growth of community care. Standards of inpatient care remain a challenge in some public and private facilities, due to levels of funding, and facilities in developing countries are typically grossly inadequate for the same reason. Even in developed countries, programs in public hospitals vary widely. Some may offer structured activities and therapies offered from many perspectives while others may only have the funding for medicating and monitoring patients. This may be problematic in that the maximum amount of therapeutic work might not actually take place in the hospital setting. This is why hospitals are increasingly used in limited situations and moments of crisis where patients are a direct threat to themselves or others. Alternatives to psychiatric hospitals that may actively offer more therapeutic approaches include rehabilitation centers or "rehab" as popularly termed. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Outpatient treatment===
Outpatient treatment involves periodic visits to a psychiatrist for consultation in his or her office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. Initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, cognitive therapy techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.

Increasingly, psychiatrists are limiting their practices to psychopharmacology (prescribing medications), as opposed to previous practice in which a psychiatrist would provide traditional 50-minute psychotherapy sessions, of which psychopharmacology would be a part, but most of the consultation sessions consisted of "talk therapy." This shift began in the early 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojtabai R, Olfson M | title = National trends in psychotherapy by office-based psychiatrists | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 8 | pages = 962–70 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18678801 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.65.8.962 | url = http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210114 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reason for this change was the advent of managed care insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists.

The earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient India and include the Ayurvedic text, [[Charaka Samhita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness: An A-to-Z Guide |volume=1|page=386|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Scull | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014 |oclc=955106253 |isbn=978-1-4833-4634-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health and Illness: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia|page=42|publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |first1=David |last1=Levinson |first2=Laura |last2=Gaccione | name-list-format = vanc |year=1997 |oclc=916942828 |isbn=978-0-87436-876-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hospitals for curing mental illness were established in India during the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith and Mental Health: Religious Resources for Healing|chapter=History of Mental Health Care|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jt5RmK_h2jgC&amp;pg=PA36 36] |first=Harold G.|last=Koenig| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Templeton Foundation Press|location=West Conshohocken |date=2005 |oclc=476009436 |isbn=978-1-59947-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks also created early manuscripts about mental disorders.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=1}} In the 4th century BCE, [[Hippocrates]] theorized that physiological abnormalities may be the root of mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; In 4th to 5th Century B.C. Greece, [[Hippocrates]] wrote that he visited [[Democritus]] and found him in his garden cutting open animals. Democritus explained that he was attempting to discover the cause of madness and melancholy. Hippocrates praised his work. Democritus had with him a book on madness and melancholy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Robert | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Anatomy of Melancholy: What it is with All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics, and Several Cures of it: in Three Partitions, with Their Several Sections, Members and Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically Opened and Cut Up|date=1881|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|ol=3149647W|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DAIGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=DAIGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, especially those with [[psychosis|psychotic]] traits, were considered [[supernatural]] in origin,&lt;ref name=Elkes13&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elkes |first1=Alexander |last2=Thorpe |first2=James Geoffrey | name-list-format = vanc |date=1967 |title=A Summary of Psychiatry |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |page=13 |oclc=4687317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view which existed throughout [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]],&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; as well as Egyptian regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dumont |first=Frank | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010 |title=A history of personality psychology: Theory, science and research from Hellenism to 21th century |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=761231096 |isbn=978-0-521-11632-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} Religious leaders often turned to versions of [[exorcism]] to treat mental disorders often utilizing methods that many consider to be cruel and/or barbaric methods. Trepanning was one of these methods used throughout history. &lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt;

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] fostered early studies in [[Islamic psychology]] and psychiatry, with many scholars writing about mental disorders. The Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]], also known as "Rhazes", wrote texts about psychiatric conditions in the 9th century.&lt;ref name=WaelMohamed&gt;{{cite web |first=Wael M.Y. |last=Mohamed | name-list-format = vanc |date=August 2008 |title=History of Neuroscience: Arab and Muslim Contributions to Modern Neuroscience |website=International Brain Research Organization |url=http://ibro.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Arab-and-Muslim-Contributions-to-Modern-Neuroscience.pdf |archive-date=10 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610082740/http://ibro.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Arab-and-Muslim-Contributions-to-Modern-Neuroscience.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chief physician of a hospital in Baghdad, he was also the director of one of the first psychiatric wards in the world. Two of his works in particular, ''El-Mansuri'' and ''Al-Hawi'', provide descriptions and treatments for mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="WaelMohamed"/&gt;

[[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]], known to the west as "Avicenna",  was a Persian polymath during the 9th and 10th centuries and one of the first to classify neurotic disorders. He pioneered [[cognitive therapy]] in order to treat each of these classified neurotic disorders. He classified neurosis into four [[emotion]]al disorders: [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], [[anger]] and [[aggression]], [[sadness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. Al-Balkhi further classified three types of depression: [[Depression (mood)|normal depression]] or [[sadness]] (''huzn''), [[Endogeny|endogenous]] depression originating from within the body, and reactive [[clinical depression]] originating from outside the body.&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;{{cite journal | last=Haque |first=Amber | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 2004 | title = Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists | url = | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 357–377 [362] | doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[bimaristan]] was founded in [[Baghdad]] in the 9th century, and several others of increasing complexity were created throughout the [[Arab world]] in the following centuries. Some of the bimaristans contained wards dedicated to the care of mentally ill patients,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, A. C. (2006). Jundi-Shapur, bimaristans, and the rise of academic medical centres.

The beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=1}} although its germination can be traced to the late eighteenth century. In the late 17th century, privately run asylums for the insane began to proliferate and expand in size. 
In 1713 the Bethel Hospital Norwich was opened, the first purpose-built asylum in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/social-innovation/the-bethel-hospital.htm/|title=The Bethel Hospital|publisher=Norwich HEART: Heritage Economic &amp; Regeneration Trust |dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113072643/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/social-innovation/the-bethel-hospital.htm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1656, [[Louis XIV of France]] created a public system of hospitals for those suffering from mental disorders, but as in England, no real treatment was applied.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=5}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] attitudes towards the mentally ill began to change. It came to be viewed as a disorder that required compassionate treatment. In 1758 English physician [[William Battie]] wrote his ''Treatise on Madness'' on the management of [[mental disorder]]. It was a critique aimed particularly at the [[Bethlem Hospital]], where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment. Battie argued for a tailored management of patients entailing cleanliness, good food, fresh air, and distraction from friends and family. He argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laffey P | title = Psychiatric therapy in Georgian Britain | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1285–97 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14580082 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291703008109 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=179425 | url-access = subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=9}}

[[File:Philippe Pinel à la Salpêtrière.jpg|thumb|Dr. Philippe Pinel at the Salpêtrière, 1795 by [[Tony Robert-Fleury]]. Pinel ordering the removal of chains from patients at the Paris Asylum for insane women.]]
The introduction of moral treatment was initiated independently by the French doctor [[Philippe Pinel]] and the English [[Quaker]] [[William Tuke]].&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt;  In 1792 Pinel became the chief physician at the [[Bicêtre Hospital]]. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. Pinel's student and successor, [[Jean Esquirol]] (1772–1840), went on to help establish 10 new mental hospitals that operated on the same principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerard |first=Donald L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Chiarugi and Pinel considered: Soul's brain/person's mind |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=381–403 |date=September 1997 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/45798/abstract? |url-access=subscription |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6696(199723)33:4&lt;381::AID-JHBS3&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tuke, Pinel and others had tried to do away with physical restraint, it remained widespread into the 19th century. At the [[The Lawn, Lincoln|Lincoln Asylum]] in England, [[Robert Gardiner Hill]], with the support of [[Edward Parker Charlesworth]], pioneered a mode of treatment that suited "all types" of patients, so that mechanical restraints and coercion could be dispensed with — a situation he finally achieved in 1838. In 1839 Sergeant John Adams and Dr. [[John Conolly]] were impressed by the work of Hill, and introduced the method into their [[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|Hanwell Asylum]], by then the largest in the country.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuki A | title = The politics and ideology of non-restraint: the case of the Hanwell Asylum | journal = Medical History | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7877402 | pmc = 1036935 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300059457 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taom"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bynum |editor1-first=W.F. |editor2-last=Porter |editor2-first=Roy |editor3-last=Shepherd |editor3-first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |date=1988 |series=The Anatomy of Madness: Essays in the history of psychiatry |volume=3 |title=The Asylum and its psychiatry |publisher=Routledge |location=London |oclc=538062123 |isbn=978-0-415-00859-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

The modern era of institutionalized provision for the care of the mentally ill, began in the early 19th century with a large state-led effort.  In England, the [[Lunacy Act 1845]] was an important landmark in the treatment of the mentally ill, as it explicitly changed the status of [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people to [[patients]] who required treatment. All asylums were required to have written regulations and to have a resident qualified [[physician]].&lt;ref name="Wright, 1999"&gt;Wright, David: "Mental Health Timeline", 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 1838, France enacted a law to regulate both the admissions into asylums and asylum services across the country. 
In the United States, the erection of state asylums began with the first law for the creation of one in New York, passed in 1842. The [[Utica State Hospital]] was opened approximately in 1850. Many state hospitals in the United States were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the [[Kirkbride Plan]], an architectural style meant to have curative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yanni|first=Carla| name-list-format = vanc |title=The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States|publisher=Minnesota University Press|location=Minneapolis|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJOC_rSW1kgC | isbn=978-0-8166-4939-6|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=34}} By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization ran into difficulties.&lt;ref name=Shorter46&gt;{{harvnb|Shorter|1997|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population,&lt;ref name=Shorter46/&gt; and asylums again became almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions.&lt;ref name=Rothman&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Rothman DJ |date=1990 |title=The Discovery of the Asylum: Social Order and Disorder in the New Republic |location=Boston |publisher=Little Brown |page=239 |isbn=978-0-316-75745-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, psychiatry made advances in the diagnosis of mental illness by broadening the category of mental disease to include [[mood disorder]]s, in addition to disease level [[delusion]] or ir[[rationality]].&lt;ref name=WCFCD&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borch-Jacobsen|first1=Mikkel|title=Which came first, the condition or the drug?|journal=London Review of Books|date=7 October 2010|volume=32|issue=19|pages=31–33|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world, with different perspectives of looking at mental disorders. For Emil Kraepelin, the initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders are all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of "nerves", and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=114}}  Following [[Sigmund Freud]]'s pioneering work, ideas stemming from [[psychoanalytic theory]] also began to take root in psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter145&gt;{{harvnb|Shorter|1997|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalytic theory became popular among psychiatrists because it allowed the patients to be treated in private practices instead of warehoused in asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter145/&gt;

[[File:Acetylcholine.svg|left|thumb|[[Otto Loewi]]'s work led to the identification of the first neurotransmitter, [[acetylcholine]].]]
By the 1970s, however, the psychoanalytic school of thought became marginalized within the field.&lt;ref name=Shorter145/&gt; Biological psychiatry reemerged during this time. [[Psychopharmacology]] became an integral part of psychiatry starting with [[Otto Loewi]]'s discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of [[acetylcholine]]; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=246}} [[Neuroimaging]] was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=270}} The discovery of [[chlorpromazine]]'s effectiveness in treating [[schizophrenia]] in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder,&lt;ref name="Turner2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner T | title = Chlorpromazine: unlocking psychosis | journal = BMJ | volume = 334 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl | pages = s7 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17204765 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39034.609074.94 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[lithium carbonate]]'s ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in [[bipolar disorder]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cade JF | title = Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 349–52 | date = September 1949 | pmid = 18142718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues.{{sfn|Shorter|1997|p=239}}

In 1963, [[President of the United States|US president]] [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced legislation delegating the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to administer Community Mental Health Centers for those being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref name=Shorter280&gt;{{harvnb|Shorter|1997|p=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, though, the Community Mental Health Centers focus shifted to providing psychotherapy for those suffering from acute but less serious mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; Ultimately there were no arrangements made for actively following and treating severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals, resulting in a large population of chronically homeless people suffering from mental illness.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{Main article|Controversy surrounding psychiatry}}
Controversy has often surrounded psychiatry, and the term [[anti-psychiatry]] was coined by psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967 and was later made popular by [[Thomas Szasz]]. The basic premise of anti-psychiatry is that: psychiatrists attempt to maliciously classify "normal" people as "deviant;" psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients; and psychiatry's history involves (what may now be seen as) dangerous treatments, such as the frontal lobectomy (commonly called, a [[lobotomy]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientology.org/scientology-today/clearwater-citizens-commission-on-human-rights-center-opening.html|title=Citizens Commission on Human Rights Expands its Activities to Expose and Handle Psychiatric Abuse in Clearwater, Tampa Bay via New Center|work=Scientology|access-date=2018-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several former patient groups have been formed often referring to themselves as "[[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antipsychiatry.org|title=The Antipsychiatry Coalition|website=www.antipsychiatry.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Church of Scientology (through one of its self-described "Humanitarian Efforts"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) created a "museum" in Los Angeles, CA (USA) which purports to show the evolution of the "evils" of psychiatry and psychology over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cchr.org/museum.html#/museum/intro|title=Psychiatry: An Industry of Death Museum|website=www.cchr.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific Scientology-related organization, the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR), is entirely devoted to the Anti-Psychiatry movement.

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''

*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===
{{Main|Medieval Unicode Font Initiative}}
In the [[Unicode]] Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html v. 5.1] (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1DC0.pdf "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement"] (26 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf "Latin Extended Additional"] (10 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf "Supplemental Punctuation"] (15 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10190.pdf "Ancient Symbols"] (12 characters) and especially [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf "Latin Extended-D"] (89 characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/ |title= MUFI: Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in [[LaTeX]] or using [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211642 overstrike] in MS Word).

Characters are "the smallest components of written language that have semantic value" but glyphs are "the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/ |title= The Unicode Consortium |publisher= Unicode, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Greek alphabet typefaces, especially historically, have been a closer simulation of handwriting.

==Styles==
{{see also|Samples of script typefaces}}
Script typefaces are organized into highly regular formal types similar to [[cursive]] writing and looser, more casual scripts.
=== Formal scripts ===
A majority of formal scripts are based upon the letterforms of seventeenth and eighteenth century writing-masters like [[George Bickham the Elder|George Bickham]], George Shelley and George Snell. The letters in their original form are generated by a quill or metal nib of a pen. Both are able to create fine and thick strokes. Typefaces based upon their style of writing appear late in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. Contemporary revivals of formal script faces can be seen in [[Kuenstler Script]] and [[Matthew Carter]]'s typeface Snell Roundhand. These typefaces are frequently used for invitations and diplomas to effect an elevated and elegant feeling. They may use [[typographic ligature]]s to have letters connect. 
=== Casual scripts ===
Casual scripts show a less formal, more active hand. The strokes may vary in width but often appear to have been created by wet brush rather than a pen nib. They appear in the early twentieth century and with the advent of photocomposition in the early-1950s their number rapidly increased. They were popularly used in advertising in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include [[Brush Script]], [[Kaufmann (script)|Kaufmann]] and [[Mistral (typeface)|Mistral]]. Some may be non-connecting. 
==Technology==
[[File:Gospel Estienne 1550.jpg|thumb|Claude Garamond's famous [[grecs du roi]] typeface, intended to mimic the handwriting of Cretan scribe [[Angelo Vergecio]]. To mimic his writing, many alternate characters are needed. While this style was once very popular in printing the [[Greek alphabet]], it is no longer used due to its complexity.]]
Script typefaces place particular demands on printing technology if the letters are intended to join up and vary like handwriting. A typeface intended to mimic handwriting, such as [[Claude Garamond]]'s [[grecs du roi]] typeface, will require many [[Stylistic alternate|alternate characters]]. In digital type these (once drawn) can be substituted seamlessly through contextual [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion in applications like InDesign, but this was complicated in metal. Another complexity in metal type was that [[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]] had to have delicate overhanging parts to interlock. This required careful design and casting for the sorts to fit together without gaps or the sorts breaking, or leaving gaps to be filled in by the natural spread of ink on paper.&lt;ref name="Venus Motorroller"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Venus Motorroller|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/7735/venus-motorroller|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/8596/korbmacher-verein-kranichfeld-invoice-1939|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Script typefaces have evolved rapidly in the second half of the 20th century due to developments in technology and the end of widespread use of metal type. Historically, most signwriting on logos, displays and shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather [[Lettering|custom-designed lettering]] created by signpainters and engravers.&lt;ref name="Not a font"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonson|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Simonson|title=Not a font|url=http://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/not-a-font|website=Mark Simonson Studio (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lettering is not type"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coles|first1=Stephen|title=Lettering is not type|url=https://fontbureau.typenetwork.com/news/article/clear-definitions|website=Type Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Vernacular"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|authorlink1=James Mosley|title=English Vernacular|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/02/english-vernacular.html|website=Typefoundry (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shinn|first1=Nick|title=The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising|url=http://typeculture.com/academic-resource/articles-essays/the-golden-age-of-hand-lettering-in-american-advertising/|website=Type Culture|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[phototypesetting]] and then computers have made printing text at a range of sizes far easier than in the metal type period, it has become increasingly common for businesses to use type for logos and signs rather than hand-drawn lettering. In addition, phototypesetting made [[Kerning|overlap of characters]] relatively simple, something very complicated to achieve in metal type. [[Matthew Carter]] has cited his 1966 Snell Roundhand typeface as deliberately designed to replicate a [[Round hand|style of calligraphy]] hard to simulate in metal.&lt;ref name="ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter|url=http://adcglobal.org/hall-of-fame/matthew-carter/|publisher=ADC|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snell roundhand Lawson1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander S. Lawson|title=Anatomy of a Typeface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&amp;pg=PA360|date=January 1990|publisher=David R. Godine Publisher|isbn=978-0-87923-333-4|pages=360–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional development enabling more sophisticated script fonts has been the release of the [[OpenType]] format, which most fonts are now released in. This allows fonts to have a large character set, increasing the sophistication of design possible, and contextual insertion, in which characters that match one another are inserted into a document automatically, so fonts can convincingly mimic handwriting without the user having to choose the correct substitute characters manually.&lt;ref name="Lettercentric: Type as Writing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Lettercentric: Type as Writing|url=http://www.printmag.com/article/lettercentric-type-as-writing/|website=Print|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern script typefaces emulate the styles of hand-drawn lettering from different historical periods.

==Unicode==
{{see|Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols}}
In [[Unicode]] there is a script Latin alphabet for [[List of mathematical symbols#Symbols based on Latin letters|mathematical use]], with both capital and small letters. Few fonts provide support for all 52 characters, and their presentations vary in style from [[roundhand]] to [[chancery hand]] and others. 

These characters are listed here: {{not a typo|𝒜ℬ𝒞𝒟ℰℱ𝒢ℋℐ𝒥𝒦ℒℳ𝒩𝒪𝒫𝒬ℛ𝒮𝒯𝒰𝒱𝒲𝒳𝒴𝒵 𝒶𝒷𝒸𝒹ℯ𝒻ℊ𝒽𝒾𝒿𝓀𝓁𝓂𝓃ℴ𝓅𝓆𝓇𝓈𝓉𝓊𝓋𝓌𝓍𝓎𝓏}}

'''Sexual inversion''' is a term used by [[sexologist]]s, primarily in the late 19th and early 20th century, to refer to [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis]]'s definition was "sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex".  Ellis, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13611/13611-h/13611-h.htm#2_Page_1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual inversion was believed to be an inborn reversal of [[gender]] traits:  male inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally female pursuits and dress and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] described female sexual inversion as "the masculine soul, heaving in the female bosom".&lt;ref name="Taylor-288"&gt;Taylor, 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its emphasis on [[gender role]] reversal, the theory of sexual inversion resembles [[transgender]], which did not yet exist as a separate concept at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially confined to medical texts, the concept of sexual inversion was given wide currency by [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s 1928 [[lesbian fiction|lesbian novel]] ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', which was written in part to popularize the sexologists' views.  Published with a foreword by the sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], it consistently used the term "invert" to refer to its protagonist, who bore a strong resemblance to one of Krafft-Ebing's case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, 133; Taylor, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
According to this theory, [[gay men]] and [[lesbian]]s were sexual "inverts", people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the "opposite" [[anatomical sex]] (according to the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Therefore, same-gender desires and attraction were explained as "latent heterosexuality", and bisexual desire was known as ''psychosexual hermaphroditism'' – in other words, gay men and lesbians were really just [[heterosexual]]s who were "born in the wrong body", and "[[bisexual]]s" were what modern-day sexologists would call [[intersexual]]s (formerly ''[[hermaphrodite]]s'') by this theory (the bisexual person's "male" part supposedly has attractions towards females, and the "female" part have attractions towards males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|date=2 Jul 2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=9781580054751|pages=8-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT8|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory fails to explain though the attraction of a "male" part towards males.

'''The Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB)''' is an international association co-founded in 1972 in USA by Drs.[[George Karreman]], [[Herbert Daniel Landahl]] and (initially chaired) by [[Anthony Bartholomay]] for the furtherance of joint scientific activities between [[Mathematics]] and [[Biology]] research communities,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth."|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/governance/history.shtml History of SMB&lt;/ref&gt; The society publishes the [https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538 "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''"] ({{ISSN|1522-9602}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538|title=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|publisher=Springer New York|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/170.pdf "Bulletin of Mathematical Biology—Facts, Figures and
Comparisons.", by Philip K. Maini, [[Santiago Schnell]] and Sara Jolliffee., ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology'' (2004) 66, 595–603, {{doi|10.1016/j.bulm.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the SMB annual newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/publications/index.shtml SMB Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of The Society for Mathematical Biology==
The Society for Mathematical Biology emerged and grew from the earlier school of [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]], initiated and supported by the Founder of [[Mathematical biology|Mathematical Biology]], [[Nicolas Rashevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Robert. 1972. "''Tribute to Nicolas Rashevsky''" 1899-1972. ''Progress in Theoretical Biology'' '''2'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; CHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, YOUTH|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the roots of SMB go back to the publication in 1939 of the first international journal of mathematical biology, previously entitled "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]"—which was founded by Nicolas Rashevsky, and which is currently published by SMB under the name of "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Rashevsky also founded in 1969 the non-profit organization "''Mathematical Biology, Incorporated''"—the precursor of SMB. Another notable member of the [[University of Chicago]] school of mathematical biology was [[Anatol Rapoport]] whose major interests were in developing basic concepts in the related area of [[mathematical sociology]], who cofounded the [[Society for General Systems Research]] and became a president of the latter society in 1965. Herbert D. Landahl was initially also a member of Rashevsky's school of mathematical biology, and became  the second president of SMB in the 1980s; both Herbert Landahl and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] from Rashevsky's research group were focused on dynamical systems approaches to [[systems biology|complex systems biology]], with the latter researcher becoming in 1980 the president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]]. 
&lt;!---{{Society for General Systems Research Presidents}}---&gt;

==Research and educational activities==
In addition to its research and news publications, the society supports education in: [[mathematical biology]], mathematical biophysics, [[systems biology|complex systems biology]] and [[theoretical biology]] through sponsorship of several topic-focused graduate and postdoctoral courses. To encourage and stimulate young researchers in this relatively new and rapidly developing field of mathematical biology, the society awards several prizes, as well as lists regularly new open international opportunities for researchers and students in this field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/prizes/index.shtml SMB Mathematical Biology Prize Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The idea of a national science policy for Sri Lanka was first discussed in the 1980s, although the matter did not move forward in any concrete way for several decades due to the more pressing economic and budgetary needs of the [[Sri Lankan civil war|civil war]] on successive administrations.&lt;ref name="SciDev2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gamage|first1=Tharaka|title=Sri Lanka's science plan moves ahead at last|url=http://m.scidev.net/global/innovation/news/sri-lanka-s-science-plan-moves-ahead-at-last-1.html|website=scidev.net|publisher=SciDevNet|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a presidential taskforce was appointed in 1991 to examine possible policy actions to be taken in the field of the sciences.&lt;ref name="SciDev2"/&gt; Further advancements came some years later, when the Science and Technology Act No. 11 of 1994 established, among others, the [[National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka|National Science Foundation]] (NSF; formally founded in 1998 for funding scientific research in the country) and the National Science and Technology Commission (NASTEC; formally founded in August 1998 to formulate scientific policy) under the newly-established Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST).&lt;ref name="SciDev2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science and Technology Development Act|url=http://srilankalaw.lk/Volume-VII/science-and-technology-development-act.html|website=SriLankaLaw lk|publisher=Blackball Publishing|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.nsf.ac.lk/index.php/the-nsf-/history|website=NSF.ac.lk|publisher=National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.nastec.lk/index.php/about-us|website=NASTEC.lk|publisher=National Science and Technology Commission  of Sri Lanka|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, [[research and development|R&amp;D]] investments in the country were minimal, being just 0.19% [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in 2006 (0.11% in 2008), lower than regional peers such as India (0.61%) and Malaysia (0.63%), and generally holding at &lt;0.2% through the years.&lt;ref name="SciDev2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mashelkar|first1=R.A.|title=Leveraging High Technology to Drive  Innovation &amp; Competitiveness  &amp; Build the Sri Lankan Knowledge  Economy|date=June 2009|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/846801468306876245/502800ESW0P1131eptember0810091Final.doc|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smriti"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniel|first1=Smriti|title=Sri Lanka launches office to foster innovation|url=http://scidev.net/global/technology/news/sri-lanka-launches-office-to-foster-innovation.html|website=Scidev.net|publisher=SciDevNet|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to various factors, including a lack of an innovation culture in Sri Lanka and a risk-averse [[private sector]] that did not see much benefit in local R&amp;D ventures.&lt;ref name="Smriti"/&gt; Sri Lanka has thus underperformed significantly in increasing the share of high technology exports as a percentage of its total manufactured exports when compared to regional peers such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acharyya|first1=Rajat|title=Product Standards, Exports and Employment: An Analytical Study|date=2005|publisher=Physica-Verlag|location=Heidelberg, Germany|isbn=3-7908-1557-8|page=6|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=DNaSOSg_cksC|accessdate=5 September 2017|chapter=2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Nanotechnology Initiative was formed informally in the early 2000s as a collaborative effort between a group of expatriate Sri Lankan scientists and officials from the NSF and the MoST, seeking to promote nanotechnology research in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Alwis|first1=Ajith|title=Nanotechnology in Sri Lanka:A new beginning with a new technology but commitment is key|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=55761|accessdate=4 September 2017|agency=The Island|publisher=Island.lk|date=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative cited several other related objectives:&lt;ref name="Island"/&gt;
*developing nanotechnology-based industry in Sri Lanka
*attracting nanotechnology expertise of Sri Lankans both in the country and outside it
*increasing the competitiveness of local industry through local R&amp;D
*value addition to national resources slated for exports 
*developing a local skills base centered around nanotechnology.
The Initiative approached the minister of science and technology at the time, [[Tissa Vitharana]], going on to brief the [[Mahinda Rajapakse|president]] in a presentation in November 2005.&lt;ref name="Island"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nanotechnology products in three years|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/090208/FinancialTimes/ft308.html|accessdate=4 September 2017|agency=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|publisher=Sundaytimes.lk|date=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] memorandum the same year, proposing the formal commitment of the [[Government of Sri Lanka]] to the initiative, which was approved by the cabinet on 23 August 2006.&lt;ref name="own world"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island"/&gt; It defined a broad objective of generating a pool of experts with all necessary facilities for nanotechnology-based research at a national level.&lt;ref name="Island"/&gt; Due to a lack of funds, however, the project stagnated until the efforts of Ravi Silva, a Sri Lankan professor and nanotechnology specialist at the [[University of Surrey]], who persuaded five private companies to consider investing in the venture.&lt;ref name="own world"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Ravi Silva|url=https://www.surrey.ac.uk/ati/nec/people/ravi_silva/|website=University of Surrey|publisher=surrey.ac.uk|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Science and Technology announced a [[public-private partnership]] to establish a nanotechnology venture in 2007 with a holding company, NANCO [[Private limited company|(Pvt.) Ltd.]], being founded soon after. SLINTEC (through NANCO) was established with the state owning a 50% stake via an initial investment of [[Sri Lankan Rupee|LKR]] 250 million through the National Science Foundation, and five private sector partners each investing LKR 40 million and owning 10% stakes for a total [[seed money|seed capital]] of LKR 450 million.&lt;ref name="Times2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nanowerk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka to set up nanotechnology research institute|date=22 December 2007|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=3816.php|website=Nanowerk|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private sector collaboration===
In March 2012, SLINTEC signed two commercial agreements:
*One with Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (NFCL), India. Funded by the [[agrochemicals]] arm of its private sector partner [[Hayleys]], SLINTEC had undertaken research into a nanoparticle-based slow-release fertilizer that reduced fertilizer loss through [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], microbial degradation and other methods (accounting for between 50-70% of conventional fertilizer wastage).&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veranja"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karunaratne|first1=Veranja|last2=Amaratunge|first2=Gehan|title=Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) reaches a significant scientific milestone|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=47677|accessdate=4 September 2017|agency=The Island|publisher=Island.lk|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFCL"&gt;{{cite news|title=SLINTEC enters strategic technology development agreement with NFCL, India|url=http://www.ft.lk/article/77226/SLINTEC-enters-strategic-technology-development-agreement-with-NFCL--India|accessdate=4 September 2017|agency=Daily Financial Times|publisher=FT.lk|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFCL bought the patent for the slow-release fertilizer for US$2.2 million, acquiring rights for commercial production and distribution outside Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veranja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NFCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian fertilizer giant buys SLINTEC research for $ 3 mn|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=47690|accessdate=4 September 2017|agency=The Island|publisher=Island.lk|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, NFCL invested a further US$0.8 million as a seed fund for SLINTEC to develop second- and third-generation nanotechnology-based fertilizer products for NFCL.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veranja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NFCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island3"/&gt;

The '''Theory of Narrative Thought''' is a theory of thought designed to bridge the gap between the [[Brain|neurological functioning of the brain]] and the flow of everyday [[Consciousness|conscious experience.]] Proposed by Lee Roy Beach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Decision making: Linking narratives and action|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2009|journal = Narrative Inquiry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The psychology of narrative thought: How the stories we tell ourselves shape our lives.|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2010|journal = Bloomington IN: Xlibris|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cognitive errors and the narrative nature of epistemic thought|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2011|journal = Perspectives on thinking, judging, and decision making.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Universitesforlaget.|editor-first = W.|editor-last = Brun|editor2-last = Keren|editor2-first = G.|editor3-last = Kirkebøen|editor3-first = G.|editor4-last = Montgomery|editor4-first = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory is expanded by Beach, Byron Bissell, and James Wise (2016).

==Background==

	The theory of narrative thought (TNT) is a refinement of image theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image theory: Decision making in personal and organizational contexts|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|publisher = Wiley|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Chichester UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Image theory: Principles, goals, and plans in decision making|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 1987|journal = Acta Psychologica|doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(87)90034-5|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mitchell|first2 = T. R. |volume=66 |pages=201–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed as an alternative to [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theory of games and economic behavior|last = von Neumann|first = J.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1947|isbn = |location = Princeton NJ|pages = |last2 = Morgenstern|first2 = O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of image theory is that decisions are shaped by long-term attempts to manage the future rather than short-term results. The image theory model of the decision process, called the compatibility test, held up in both laboratory and field tests (Beach, L. R., &amp; Connolly, T. (2005). The Psychology of Decision Making: People in Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and has been retained, but renamed, as the discrepancy test in TNT.

	Image theory’s weakness was its failure to adequately specify the concept of image.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Subsequent attempts to specify it led to its replacement by narrative, the specification of which was based upon the work of Walter R. Fisher (1987) in [[Communication theory|communications theory]]. Exploration of the specification’s implications led to TNT, in which [[narrative]] is supposed to be the natural mode of human thought in a story that defines what led up to this moment, what is happening now, and what can be expected to happen in the future. This, in turn, led to examination of the apparently “natural” urge to think narratively and its roots in known neurological processes that format neural events in a rudimentary narrative form. This, in turn, led to the view that narrative thinking is a product of [[evolution]].

==Narrative development==
The theory of narrative thought (TNT) describes the brain as being composed of subsystems that act together to give rise to consciousness. Some of these subsystems, such as perception and memory, contribute content to consciousness. One subsystem in the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] codes the content in language while a corresponding subsystem in the right hemisphere links it with emotions. Working together as a single system, called the “interpreter,” they organize the content of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s in charge? Free will and the science of the brain|last = Gazzaniga|first = M. S.|publisher = HarperCollins|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order is the origin of narrative but at this point it is rudimentary, a proto-narrative. The proto-narrative is simple but up-to-date; it reflects what is happening at the moment. For infants, proto-narratives are pretty much the whole story, but as memories are formed, past proto-narratives become linked with present proto-narratives and, as caregivers lend a hand, more elaborate narratives take shape. As a store of elaborated narratives develops, proto-narratives continue to update them with current information from the [[perceptual system]]. This keeps the narratives aware of what is going on in the internal and external environments. Over time, two kinds of narratives develop.

== Two kinds of narrative ==
Chronicle narratives are about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what is expected to happen in the future. They are the ongoing story of one’s conscious experience. Procedural narratives are about how to do things. They are about the actions one can take to better inform one’s chronicle narratives. They also are about the actions one can take to shape the future by acting directly upon the internal or external environment to produce desired results. Procedural narratives are subordinate to chronicle narratives. When used alone, the word “narrative” refers to chronicle narratives. [Note that chronicle and procedural narratives are parallel to, but not identical to, Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) System 1 and System 2.]

==Nature of narratives==
Narratives are more than just updated memories about what has happened recently. They are the stuff of ongoing conscious experience, of moment-to-moment thinking, of the richness of mental life, and they are the foundations for informed guesses about the future. They are a mixture of memories and of visual, auditory, and other imagery as well as the accompanying emotions. Their elements are symbols that stand for real or imagined events and actors (including oneself), where the actors are animate beings or inanimate forces. The events and actors are linked by causality. Causality implies temporality and, for animate actors, purpose. That is, a narrative consists of a temporal arrangement of events that are purposefully caused by animate beings (including oneself) or are the result of inanimate forces. The narrative’s storyline is its meaning, which is created by a coherent arrangement of the events and actors.

==Causality, plausibility, and coherence==
Causality is the structural backbone of all narratives, both chronicle and procedural. This is because it is the source of narrative temporality. This temporal aspect of causality works retrospectively, from effect to cause, which allows one to account for what is happening now as a result of what has happened in the past. And it works prospectively, from cause to effect, which allows one to set expectations for what will happen in the future as a result of what is happening now and what came before. A good narrative is plausible if its actors’ actions contribute to the story line and are not uncharacteristic, i.e., are reasonably consistent across narratives. A good narrative is coherent if the actions of the actors and the effects of those actions conform to one’s causal rules. In short, a good narrative makes sense in that there are no loose ends.

==Causal rules==
Noncontingent rules are about what to expect to happen as a result of actions by other people or outside forces over which one has no control. Contingent rules are about what one expects to happen as a result of one’s own actions. These rules form the causal linkages among narratives’ elements and are the bases of expected and action projections respectively.

Causal rules tell one what caused something to happen or how to make something happen. Another kind of rule, normative rules, tell one why something should happen. Normative rules are about what qualifies as desirable and what does not. That is, normative rules are standards for what is ethical, right, proper, principled, reasonable, appropriate, preferred, and so on, all of which are one’s values and preferences.

==Current narrative==
The current narrative is the narrative one is focused upon at the moment. It is the narrative that makes sense of what has happened leading up to the present, what is happening right now, and what will happen next. The latter, results from extrapolating the past and present segments of current narrative to make educated guesses about the future. A guess about how the future might unfold if one does not make an effort to change it is called an expected projection and a guess about how the future might unfold as a result of one’s efforts to change it is called an action projection. Both projections are narratives. Both are extrapolations of the current narrative. Both are constructed using one’s store of causal rules. Both are subject to the scrutiny of normative rules. Both are imaginary.

==Decision making==
When the future is projected, based upon the current narrative, the emotions associated with the relevant normative rules provide the criteria for evaluating the desirability of that future. Each feature of the projected future elicits an emotion that reflects how well it meets the relevant standard(s) set by one’s normative rule(s). A positive emotion is elicited if it meets the standard(s) and a negative emotion is elicited if it doesn’t. The strength of the elicited emotion is a function of the degree to which the feature exceeds or falls short of the standard(s). When evaluating the desirability of the projected future, the focus is on the features that fall short of one’s standards—called violations. If the violations are too abundant, too large, or too important, the associated negative emotions mount to a point at which one must conclude that the projected future will be undesirable. When this happens, survival, or simply unacceptable discomfort, dictates that something must be done to change the future so that when it arrives it will be more desirable than if things are simply allowed to happen as they will. The action agenda for changing the future is called a plan and execution of that plan is called implementation. The anticipated result of implementing the plan is the action projection. An acceptable plan is one that offers a sufficiently desirable future, a future that is compatible with one’s values and preferences.

==Plans==
A plan is a narrative about how one intends to go from the present to a more desirable future—how one intends to influence the course of ongoing events in a desirable direction. Like other narratives, plans must be plausible and coherent. Plausibility means that all the relevant elements, including oneself, are included and that their proposed actions are reasonable. Coherence means that the sequence of tactics creates a feasible causal chain from the present to the desired future. Plausibility is revealed by the ease with which one can imagine oneself and other actors engaging in a successful implementation of the plan, even if it will require hard work. Plausibility also requires that this activity seems natural and lifelike, and that success doesn’t rely on unlikely events or unrealistic amounts effort and resources. Coherence is revealed by the completeness of the causal chain of tactics, even though one knows one probably won’t end up doing things exactly as planned. A plan that lacks plausibility and/or coherence inspires little confidence (which is an emotion associated with a normative standard), which prompts its revision or replacement by another plan.

Briefly stated: (1) There are two kinds of narratives: chronicle narratives, which are stories about ongoing events, including the expected future, and procedural narratives, which are stories about how to do things; (2) both kinds of narrative are structured by time and causality and both are “good narratives” if they are plausible and coherent; (3) the undesirability of the expected future is assessed by its failure to meet standards set by one’s values and preferences; (4) action is prompted when the projected future is determined to be so undesirable as to be unacceptable.

==TNT as a theory of mind==

Both Beach (2010) and Beach, Bissell, and Wise (2016) open with a historical description of the ebbing fortunes of “executive mind,” as a scientific concept but how, over the past 50 years, it has come back, albeit on firmer ground, as “the brain.” But while “the brain” may be the new name for “mind,” the fact that the old name continues to be used in both scientific and everyday discourse suggests that the new name doesn’t quite do the job. That is, rather than merely reflecting sloppy usage, the word “mind” reflects something more than merely neural activity in the brain.

Other than the computer analogy and the information processing metaphor, cognitive science has produce no encompassing theory. But it seems to be widely assumed that when such a theory appears, it will necessarily be in terms of brain function to which conscious experience is subsidiary and derivative. TNT challenges this assumption by recognizing that brain functioning and conscious experience are two qualitatively different things. Although subjective experience derives from brain activity, it is not reducible to it. Therefore, the theory recognizes the importance of the brain and how it works, but it also recognizes the importance of conscious experience and how it works. Putting the two together as equally legitimate and complementary provides the “something more” than neural activity in the brain that is implied by the word “mind.”
 
Much has been written about the characteristics of mind, mostly by philosophers. The commonalities across those discussions reveals three primary characteristics that a theory of mind should address and that are, in fact, addressed by TNT: Thinking that is both reflective and reflexive—that is able to consider both itself and things other than itself. Knowing that allows distinctions between truth and falsity, error and ignorance, and belief and opinion. Purpose that results in actions aimed at foreseen objectives. In addition, TNT addresses the most common questions raised in these philosophical discussions: How does the mind operate? What are its “intrinsic excellences or defects?” How is it related to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, and to other minds? Is it possessed in common with animals? Does it exist separate from corporeality? Insofar as the theory adequately deals with these characteristics and answers these questions, it qualifies as a modern theory of mind.

'''''Ways of Hearing'''''({{ISBN|0 575 06809 4}}) is a 2001 book about [[pop music]] by [[Ben Thompson (author)|Ben Thompson]]. The book, which is subtitled "A user's guide to the pop psyche, from [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] to [[Eminem]]", describes how Western pop music intersects with films, videos, television shows, and fiction. The book includes short essays on a number of performers, including alternative rocker [[Blixa Bargeld]], contemporary composer [[John Cale]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], hip-hop artists [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Eminem]], Montreal avant-garde band [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], heavy metal singer-bassist [[Lemmy]], [[Meatloaf (singer)]], Rolling Stones guitarist [[Cliff Richard]], [[Pet Shop Boys]] and country rockers [[Wilco]]. The last section in the book describes different subgenres of pop, including metal, psychedelic, and political rock.

A review of the book calls it "a collection of rock writing" based around the author's goal of examining "the different ways of listening which form subcultural territories around various forms of popular music".&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Book review available online at: http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-ways-hearing-ben-thompson  Accessed on July 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer states that as "...a collection of rock journalism, this holds up quite well", and states that it contains "...competent, occasionally inspired rock writing". The reviewer states that Thompson has "...an intriguing way to introduce and link an apparently disparate bunch of information, and makes the reader contextualise seemingly off-hand utterings of musicians in within a new frame."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; The reviewer states that some of the interviews with performers that Thompson included seem like "padding". Moreover, the reviewer states that the "segments of academic-ese" that Thompson puts around the interview sections "tend to obfuscate the topic at hand, or, when they’re successful, set up an intriguingly open-ended argument which, ten pages later, is revealed to be literally open-ended...[without providing]... many of his own answers".&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

'''William Leonard Pereira''' (April 25, 1909 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1985) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry&lt;ref name=wpereira&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Portuguese-Americans.html William L Pereira at (www.everyculture.com/) Portuguese Americans]&lt;/ref&gt; who was noted for his [[Futurist architecture#Post-modern futurism|futuristic]] designs of landmark buildings such as the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Remarkably prolific, he worked out of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and was known for his love of [[science fiction]] and expensive cars, but mostly for his unmistakable style of [[architecture]], which helped define the look of mid-20th century [[United States|America]].

==Personal life==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Pereira graduated from the [[University of Illinois School of Architecture|School of Architecture, University of Illinois]] and began his [[career]] in his home city. He had some of his earliest architectural experience helping to draft the master plan for the 1933 "[[Century of Progress|A Century of Progress]]" [[World's Fair|Chicago World's Fair]]. With his brother, [[Hal Pereira]], he designed the Esquire Theater at 58 East Oak Street, considered one of Chicago's best examples of [[Art Deco]] style. 
[[Image:SanFrancisco DownTown.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco, 1972]]
He had two wives, former model and actress Margaret McConnell (married June 24, 1934) and Bronya Galef; the latter marriage ending with his death. He has two children, William Pereira, Jr., and a  daughter, Monica Pereira, a Spanish teacher.

William Pereira died of cancer at age 76 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles. At his request, no funeral services were planned.

==Career==

In the 1930s, he and Hal moved to Los Angeles. After working as a solo architect, Pereira was hired by the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]] and designed the first buildings for the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]], which was dedicated September 27, 1942.

Pereira also had a brief stint as a [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] art director. He shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]] for the action/adventure film ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]'' (1942).&lt;ref name="Oscars1943"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1943 |title=The 15th Academy Awards (1943) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-06-22 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the art director for "[[This Gun for Hire]]", Alan Ladd's first film.  He was production designer of the drama ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]), and of the war drama ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) . Pereira was also the [[film producer|producer]] of the [[film noir|noir]] crime/drama ''[[Johnny Angel]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]), and of the Joan Fontaine drama ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]).

Though his buildings were often quite stark and sterile in their appearance (owing largely to the science fiction of the era), they were noted for their functional style with a certain flair that made them unmistakable. He took pride in the concept of designing for the future.

In 1949, Pereira became a professor of architecture at the [[University of Southern California]]. He then formed a partnership with fellow architect and classmate, [[Charles Luckman]], in the early 1950s. The firm, [[Pereira &amp; Luckman]], grew into one of the nation's busiest. The duo designed some of Los Angeles's most well-known buildings, including the famed "[[Theme Building]]" at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (in collaboration with [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]] and [[Welton Becket]]).

[[Image:UCILibrary.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The library at [[University of California, Irvine]], illustrating Pereira's paneled facade system]]
He parted with Luckman in 1959. Afterward, he formed the third and final company of his career, "William L. Pereira &amp; Associates." In the 1960s and 1970s, he and his team completed over 250 projects, including drawing up the master plans for the Los Angeles International Airport expansion and developing the master plan for the 93,000 acre (376&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) city of [[Irvine, California]], which put his photograph on the cover of ''Time Magazine'' in September 1963. He later worked with [[Ian McHarg]] on the plan for the [[new town]] of [[The Woodlands, Texas]].

Pereira's buildings were easily identified by their unmistakable style, often taking unusual forms such as [[pyramid]]s and [[ziggurat]]s. They usually projected a grand presence, heavyset in appearance and often sitting atop "pedestals" that were themselves an integral part of the building. Many of his buildings were complemented by water features and some were almost entirely surrounded by water. The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], for instance, was a complex of three [[Googie]]-esque buildings rising up out of a lake and interconnected by a series of causeways and bridges.

Pereira designed the campus plans of the [[University of Southern California]], the [[University of California, Irvine]], and [[Pepperdine University]].

His material of choice in creating his unique geometric forms was pre-cast [[concrete]]. Working in this medium, he could create his impressive facades by simply attaching them as panels on to the steel frame of the building.

==Legacy==
By the time of his death, Pereira had over 400 projects to his name. Among the structures he designed throughout [[Southern California]] were [[CBS Television City]], [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]], the Los Angeles County Art Museum, the Howard Johnson Hotel and Water Playground in Anaheim, and the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. He is also responsible for creating the monumental Spanish-inspired facades that defined [[J. W. Robinson's|Robinson's]] department stores for nearly 20 years, and he was the architect of [[Pepperdine University]] at Malibu, named by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' as the most beautiful college campus in America. Out of his immense body of work, three have really stood out in the public mind: the master-planned cities of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

His most praised and criticized work was probably the Transamerica building, which was completed in 1972. It was first panned as an intrusion on the city's skyline, but has been accepted as having more character than the buildings around it and as being an oddly creative city symbol.

Perhaps his greatest lasting legacy besides his buildings are the numerous respected architects of today who came out of both Pereira's firm and the classes he taught at [[University of Southern California|USC]], including [[Gin D. Wong|Gin Wong]], [[William Blurock]], and [[Frank Gehry]]. Pereira's firm was taken over upon his death by his two primary cohorts, Scott Johnson and Bill Fain.

'''Zoology''' ({{IPAc-en|z|u|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|,_|z|oʊ|-}}) or '''animal biology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies the animal kingdom, including the [[anatomy|structure]], [[embryology]], [[evolution]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[Ethology|habits]], and distribution of all [[animal]]s, both living and [[extinction|extinct]], and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ζῷον, ''zōion'', i.e. "[[animal]]" and λόγος, ''logos'', i.e. "knowledge, study".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=zoology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zoology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient history to Darwin===
[[File:Gessner Conrad 1516-1565.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conrad Gesner]] (1516–1565). His ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'' is considered the beginning of modern zoology.]]
{{Main article|History of zoology (through 1859)}}

The history of zoology traces the study of the [[animal|animal kingdom]] from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of ''zoology'' as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from [[natural history]] reaching back to the [[Aristotle's biology|biological works of Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mehmet|last=Bayrakdar |year=1986 |title=Al-Jahiz and the rise of biological evolution |journal=Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi |publisher=[[Ankara University|Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi]]|volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=307–15 |url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/772/9842.pdf |doi=10.1501/Ilhfak_0000000674|accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking about Life: The History and Philosophy of Biology and Other Sciences|author1=Paul S.

Prominent in this movement were [[Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Scientific classification|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[fossil record]], as well as the development and behavior of organisms. [[Microscopy]] revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lois N. Magner |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=133–144 |isbn=0-8247-0824-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing importance of [[natural theology]], partly a response to the rise of [[mechanical philosophy]], encouraged the growth of [[natural history]] (although it entrenched the [[teleological argument|argument from design]]).

Over the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional [[scientific discipline]]. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]]. [[Cell theory]] provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Sapp |title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 7 |isbn=0-19-515619-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Coleman |title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0-521-29293-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Darwin===
{{Main article|History of zoology (since 1859)}}
These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin gave a new direction to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]], by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a [[genealogical]] basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]], and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] created [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Science and Creationism: a view from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 |format=php |accessdate= September 24, 2009 |edition=Second |year= 1999 |publisher=The National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, DC |isbn=-0-309-06406-6 |page=28 |chapter=Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=27#p200064869970027001 |ref=NAS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Structural===
[[Cell biology]] studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their [[behavior]], interactions, and [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for single-celled organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry Gray |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently. Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be categorized under "structural" studies.

===Physiological===
[[File:Dog anatomy anterior view.jpg|thumb|Animal anatomical engraving from ''Handbuch der Anatomie der Tiere für Künstler''.]]
Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Physiology studies how for example [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact.

===Evolutionary===
Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[herpetology]], or [[entomology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–16 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John H. Gillespie |title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide |year=1998 |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8008-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theory. Following the development of [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting]] techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Geoffrey K.|last2=Curtis|first2=Caitlin|last3=Millar|first3=Craig D.|last4=Huynen|first4=Leon|last5=Lambert|first5=David M.|date=2014-01-01|title=DNA fingerprinting in zoology: past, present, future|journal=Investigative Genetics|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/2041-2223-5-3|issn=2041-2223|pmc=3909909|pmid=24490906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vassiliki Betty Smocovitis |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are [[phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]].

===Classification===
[[Biological classification|Scientific classification in zoology]], is a method by which zoologists group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|zoological systematics]].

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).]]
Many scientists now consider the [[five-kingdom system]] outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The classification, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=4 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethology===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate the regurgitating reflex.]]
[[Ethology]] is the [[scientific method|scientific]] and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ETHOLOGY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=30 October 2012|quote=2 : the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour especially under natural conditions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as opposed to [[behaviourism]], which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting.  Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many future ethologists.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–3 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiley, R. H. |year=1981 |title=Social structure and individual ontogenies: problems of description, mechanism, and evolution |journal= Perspectives in ethology |volume=4 |issue= |pages=105–133 |url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/IndividualOntogenies.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on topics like [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]]. The creation of this study is widely accredited to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], a British biologist who had some of his work jointly published with [[Charles Darwin]].

Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from [[natural history]] to [[biology]] at the start of the 19th century. Since [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], comparative [[Anatomy|anatomical]] study has been associated with morphography, shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation:  [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[teratology]] and [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/zoology#toc48756|title=zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]], his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.

Gradually zoology expanded beyond Huxley's [[comparative anatomy]] to include the following sub-disciplines:
* [[Zoography]], also known as ''descriptive zoology'', is the applied science of describing animals and their [[habitat]]s
* [[Comparative anatomy]] studies the structure of animals
* [[Animal physiology]]
* [[Behavioral ecology]]
* [[Ethology]] studies animal behavior
* [[Invertebrate zoology]]
* [[Vertebrate zoology]]
* [[Soil zoology]]
* The various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as [[mammalogy]], [[biological anthropology]], [[herpetology]], [[ornithology]], and [[entomology]] identify and classify [[species]] and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups.

Related fields:
* [[Evolutionary biology]]: Development of both animals and plants is considered in the articles on [[evolution]], [[population genetics]], [[heredity]], [[Genetic variability|variation]], [[Mendelism]], and [[reproduction]].
* [[Molecular biology]] studies the common [[genetics|genetic]] and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants
* [[Palaeontology]]
* [[Systematics]], [[cladistics]], [[phylogenetics]], [[phylogeography]], [[biogeography]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] classify and group species via common descent and regional associations.
