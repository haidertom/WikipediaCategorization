'''''101 Philosophy Problems''''' (1999) is a philosophy book for a general audiences by [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] published by Routledge.

==Format and summary==
The format of the book was unique and later copied by other authors. For example, in [[Julian Baggini]]'s ''The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten'' it was observed that the books "format is essentially the same as that first successfully introduced by Martin Cohen's ''101 Philosophy Problems''."&lt;ref&gt;Law, Stephen. "Saturday Review: Science &amp; philosophy: Food for thought: Stephen Law on moral dilemmas: The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten, and Ninety-Nine Other Thought Experiments by [[Julian Baggini]] 256pp, Granta, pounds 14.99". ''The Guardian'' [London (UK)] 03 Sep 2005: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' (London),&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gensler, ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', February 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Gensler, Professor of philosophy, at John Carroll University, Cleveland, describes the book:

:"The book has 101 humorous little stories, each with a philosophical  problem (not however, necessarily, the usual [[Unsolved problems in philosophy]]). For example, problem 54 is about Mr Megasoft, who dies leaving  his fortune to his favourite computer. Megasoft's children take the matter to court, contending that the computer cannot think and so cannot inherit money. Mr Megasoft's lawyers claim that the computer can think. But on what grounds can we say that computers can or cannot think?"

Other stories deal with [[paradoxes]], ethics, aesthetics, perception, time, God, physics, and knowledge and include  problems from Zeno, Descartes, Russell, Nelson Goodman, Edmund Gettier and others. The  problems are  followed by a discussion section  and a glossary.

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[The Philosopher]]'', Dr. Zenon Stavrinides says that:

:"Both in regard to its structure and the style in which it is written, it is very unconventional. The first part of the book consists of a series of very short stories or narrative texts, grouped by subject-matter, setting out problems or puzzles of philosophical interest. Some of these problems are well-known in philosophical literature, e.g. the [[Epimenides paradox|paradox of Epimenides the Cretan]], who said: 'All Cretans are liars'. In the second part of the book, entitled 'Discussions', Cohen provides explanations and analyses of the issues raised by each of the problems, with some references to the treatment offered by particular historical philosophers. These discussions are intelligent and balanced, if (in most cases at least) inevitably inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/reviews/202revs.htm |title=Philosophy Problems, official website |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031045351/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/reviews/202revs.htm |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Abū al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Qalaṣādī''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسن علي بن محمد بن علي القرشي البسطي}}; 1412&amp;ndash;1486) was a [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karpinski|first1=Louis Charles|title=The history of arithmetic|date=1965|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=7l4LAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=al-kalasadi+%22spanish+arab%22&amp;dq=al-kalasadi+%22spanish+arab%22&amp;hl=ar&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik5f_E447ZAhVSyKQKHUjPBQgQ6AEIJzAA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] from [[Andalusia|Al-Andalus]] specializing in [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence]]. Al-Qalaṣādī is known for being one of the most influential voices in [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] since antiquity and for taking "the first steps toward the introduction of [[algebra]]ic symbolism&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. He wrote numerous books on [[arithmetic]] and algebra, including ''al-Tabsira fi'lm al-hisab'' ({{lang-ar|التبصير في علم الحساب}} "''Clarification of the science of arithmetic''").&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Al-Qalaṣādī was born in [[Baza, Granada|Baza]], an outpost of the [[Emirate of Granada]]. He received education in [[Granada]], but continued to support his family in Baza. He published many works and eventually retired to his native Baza. He spent seven years living in [[Tlemcen]], where he studied under the local [[Berbers|Berber]] scholars, the most important of which was a man named Ibn Zaghu. 

[[File:Granada by Piri Reis.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Map of the coasts of the kingdom of Granada by [[Piri Reis]] (16th century).]]

His works dealt with Algebra and contained the precise mathematical answers to problems in everyday life, such as the composition of medicaments, the calculation of the drop of irrigation canals and the explanation of frauds linked to instruments of measurement. The second part belongs to the already ancient tradition of judicial and cultural mathematics and joins a collection of little arithmetical problems presented in the form of poetical riddles

In 1480 the [[Christian]] forces of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], "The Catholic Monarchs", raided and often pillaged the city, al-Qalasādī himself served in the mountain citadels which were erected in the vicinity of Baza. al-Qalasādī eventually left his homeland and took refuge with his family in [[Béja]], [[Tunisia]], where he died in 1486. Baza was eventually besieged by the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella and its inhabitants sacked.

==Symbolic algebra==
Like his predecessors al-Qalaṣādī made attempts at creating an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]]. However, these symbols were not the invention of al-Qalaṣādī. The same ones had been used by other mathematicians in North Africa 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; Al-Qalaṣādī represented [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] using characters from the [[Arabic alphabet]], where:&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

*ﻭ (''[[Waw (letter)|wa]]'') means "and" for [[addition]] (+)
*ﻻ (''[[Illa (Arabic)|illa]]'') means "less" for [[subtraction]] (-)
*ف (''[[Fāʾ|fi]]'') means "times" for [[multiplication]] (*)
*ة (''ala'') means "over" for [[Division (mathematics)|division]] (/)
*ﺝ (''[[Ǧīm|j]]'') represents ''jadah'' meaning "[[Root of a function|root]]"
*ﺵ (''[[Shin (letter)|sh]]'') represents ''shay'' meaning "thing" for a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] (x)
*ﻡ (''[[Mīm|m]]'') represents ''moraba'a'' for a [[Square (algebra)|square]] (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*ﻙ (''[[Kāf|k]]'') represents ''moka'ab'' for a [[Cube (algebra)|cube]] (x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
*ﻝ (''[[Lām|l]]'') represents ''ya'adilu'' for [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] (=)

As an example, the equation &lt;math&gt;2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0&lt;/math&gt; would have been written using his notation as:

&lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt; 2&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻙ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻭ &lt;/SPAN&gt; 3&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻡ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻻ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 4&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﺵ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻭ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 5 &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻝ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 0 &lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Acrotomophilia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκρότομος "having the top cut off" (from ἄκρον ''akron'' "extremity" and -τομος ''-tomos'' from τέμνω ''temno'' "I cut") and φιλία ''philia'' "love") is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual expresses strong sexual interest in [[amputee]]s. It is a counterpart to ''[[apotemnophilia]]'', the sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee.

==Overview==
Acrotomophiles may be attracted to [[amputee]]s because they like the way they look or they may view the amputee’s stump as a [[phallic]] object which can be used for [[sexual pleasure]]. Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an [[amputee]].

==Interests and behaviours==
In a survey of acrotomophiles, leg amputations were preferred over arm amputations, amputations of a single limb over double amputations, and amputations that left a stump over amputations that left no stump.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D. (1983). An erotic attraction to amputees. ''Sexuality and Disability, 6,'' 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.”&lt;ref&gt;Solvang, P. (2007). The amputee body desired: Beauty destabilized? Disability re-valued? ''Sexuality and Disability, 25,'' 51–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Jung]]ian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective subconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.

==Ethical issues==
Some people question whether amputating one's own body parts or operating on a partner for the sake of sexual pleasure is ethical. For some, modifying the body is a private ritual of self-ownership and freedom of choice. Psychiatrists may make a diagnosis of [[Body integrity identity disorder]] (B.I.I.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Marantz Henig. (March 22, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/health/psychology/22ampu.html At War With Their Bodies, They Seek to Sever Limbs]. [[The New York Times]]. Retrieved: 2008.02.08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fleshbot.com (March 22, 2005) [http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223070910/http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php |date=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term ''amelotatism'' has also been used to describe acrotomophilia.  The sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee is ''[[apotemnophilia]]''.&lt;ref name=money&gt;[[John Money]], Kent W. Simcoe. 1984. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k731445740p1g7q8/ Sexuality and Disability Journal. "Acrotomophilia, sex and disability: New concepts and case report".]  Springer Netherlands.

(p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; John Money (1977) used the terms ''autoapotemnophilia'' and ''alloapotemnophilia'' to describe the erotic interest of wanting to be or appear as an amputee versus wanting amputees as sexual partners;&lt;ref&gt;Money, J., Jobaris, R., &amp; Furth, G. (1977). Apotemnophilia: Two cases of self demand amputation as a sexual preference. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 13'', 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt; neither term has been widely used since. The term ''teratophilia'' is used to describe arousal from deformed or monstrous people.&lt;ref name = Aggrawal2008&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=Teratophilia&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Teratophilia | title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | last=Aggrawal | first=Anil | authorlink=Anil Aggrawal | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | year=2008 | ISBN=1-4200-4308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6548">'''Battlefield archaeology''' is a sub-discipline of [[archaeology]] that began in North America with Dr. [[Douglas D. Scott]]'s, National Park Service, metal detecting of [http://nps.gov/libi/ Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument] in 1983.  It is not considered distinct from '''Military archaeology''' or [[Recceology]] (i.e., the recovery of surface finds and non-invasive site surveying).

''Battlefield archaeology'' also refers to the specific study of a particular archaeological horizon in which a military action occurred. This may include both 'bounded' battlefields where troop dispositions, numbers and the order of battle are known from textual records, and also from undocumented evidence of conflict. The discipline is distinct from military history in that it seeks to answer different questions, including the experiences of ordinary soldiers in wider political frameworks. Therefore, ''battlefield archaeology'' is not concerned, primarily, with the causes of conflict but of the sites where conflict actually took place, and of the archaeology of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, T.L. (2005) Pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the ''battlefield'' is a contemporary concept, the archaeology of battlefields incorporates the study of both ancient and modern military technologies, features and conflicts. It may also incorporate events such as civil unrest, including public demonstrations and riots. The discipline, therefore, applies the approaches and techniques of archaeology to military and civil conflict. Conflicts in the twentieth century in particular have been characterised by wars of ethnicity, nationality and identity, where civilians and civilian environments (i.e., domestic buildings, urban centres) have become involved in warfare, and are often inseparable from it.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield et al. (2002) Pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as 'Total War', understood by the engagement of entire populations and economies within the sphere of warfare. The archaeology of contemporary conflict, therefore, is a 'total' project, considering the impact of conflict and modern weapons systems on civilian as well as military targets.

The study of the relationships and contexts of the material by-products of war give an alternate account to the version recorded in a history book, poem, or witness account, which may be constructed though bias, or may present only a limited perspective of the events.

==History of battlefield archaeology==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
Battlefield archaeology was first used in England at the site of the [[battle of Naseby]]. Between 2006 and 2008 the [[Council for British Archaeology]] conducted a resource assessment for [[English Heritage]], creating a database of more than 200 battlefields in England. According to the report, "battlefields [in England] older than 1066 are at present almost impossible to locate". By 2012 there was no comparable database for Europe, though 56 battlefields had been ascertained for Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Foard, G. and Morris, R. (2012) Pg. xii, 37&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Register of Historic Battlefields]], now maintained by [[Historic England]], was founded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/registered-battlefields/|title=Registered Battlefields {{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War One and Archaeology==
The First World War exhibited a conflict that mobilised large numbers of soldiers and a sophisticated and diverse array of material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, N.J. (2002) Pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Battlefield Archaeology in this arena has dealt with the battlefields of conflict, where human action and technology shaped the landscape into recognisable and extensive features. It also concerns the study of material culture associated with individuals: including 'trench art', such as engraved shells and the personal belongings of private soldiers, officers and civilian staff.

Excavations and survey work have also been conducted in southern [[Jordan]],&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, N, [[Nicholas J. Saunders|Saunders, N]], and Thope, D (2006) The archaeology of Lawrence of Arabia’s war: a report on the Great Arab Revolt Project’s first field season in November 2006. Current World Archaeology '''23''', June/July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; known for the conflict during World War One between Ottoman forces, Bedouin tribes-people and British forces commanded by [[T.E. Lawrence]] (the '[[Great Arab Revolt]]'). The project looked for the militarised footprint of the conflict, basing its conclusions on trench systems, army camps and the refuse of forces (small-finds including coins, bullets and other military gear).

'''Best Enemies''' is an education resource and film created by Ross and Darren Bark that discusses the cyber bullying problem in Australian schools, and explores how to tackle it and help students become pro-active in reporting and stopping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/bully-victims-urged-to-tell-tales-online-20090620-crwh.html|title=Bully victims urged to tell tales online |last=Browne|first=Rachel |date=June 21, 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and services==
Best Enemies has also been used as a community-based education program that illustrates the issue of cyber bullying through a film based on a true story of a 15-year-old girl whose best friend betrayed her in a bullying campaign conducted via SMS and online messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php Youth Action and Policy Association NSW] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010115624/http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php |date=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program targets schools and youth organisations to address the causes and consequences of the serious social problem of cyber bullying and cyber safety. The program is supported by Youth Interagency Groups, the Department of Education and Training and various agencies of the NSW Government.

The Best Enemies study guide and cybersafety resource was produced by The [[Australian Teachers of Media]] and is also distributed by The Education Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeducationshop.com.au/shop/product.asp?pID=3314&amp;cID=19 The Education Shop - Best Enemies Study Guide and DVD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is supported by [[Hoyts]], [[Girlfriend Magazine]], Mentos Cube, [[Myspace]] and Point Zero Youth Services.

==Partnership with Bully Free Australia Foundation==
In March 2013, Best Enemies and The Bully Free Australia Foundation signed a partnership agreement with a vision to "protect and empower Australian children and adolescents to live a fulfilling life free from all forms of bullying".

On 16 March 2013, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard formally opened The Bully Free Australia Foundation at Essendon Airport to a crowd of more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/bill-to-stop-workplace-bullies-20130316-2g76e.html|title=Bill to stop workplace bullies |last=Schetzer|first=Alana |date=March 16, 2013|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20429">{{Other uses|Copenhagen School (disambiguation)}}
'''Biblical minimalism''', also known as the '''Copenhagen School''' because two of its most prominent figures taught at [[Copenhagen University]], was a movement or trend in [[biblical scholarship]] that began in the 1990s with two main claims: 
# that the Bible cannot be considered reliable evidence for what had happened in ancient Israel; and  
# that "Israel" itself is a problematic subject for historical study.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA33#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20main%20claims&amp;f=false 33]}}

Minimalism was not a unified movement, but rather a label that came to be applied to several scholars at different universities who held similar views, chiefly [[Niels Peter Lemche]] and [[Thomas L. Thompson]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Philip R. Davies]], and [[Keith Whitelam]]. Minimalism gave rise to intense debate during the 1990s—the term "minimalists" was in fact a derogatory one given by its opponents, who were consequently dubbed "maximalists", but in fact neither side accepted either label. 

The so-called Maximalists, or [[Biblical archaeology school#William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school|neo-Albrightians]], were composed of two quite distinct groups, the first represented by the archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] and the influential publication ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', the second by biblical scholar [[Iain Provan]] and Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].{{sfn|Banks|2006|p=185}} Although these debates were in some cases heated, most scholars occupied the middle ground evaluating the arguments of both schools critically. 

Since the 1990s, while some of the minimalist arguments have been challenged or rejected, others have been refined and adopted into the mainstream of biblical scholarship.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}

==Background: academic study of the Bible in the 20th century==
By the opening of the 20th century the stories of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Noah's ark]], and the [[Tower of Babel]]—in short, chapters 1 to 11 of the [[Book of Genesis]]—had become subject to greater scrutiny by scholars, and the starting point for biblical history was regarded as the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and the other [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew patriarchs]]. Then in the 1970s, largely through the publication of two books, [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' it became widely accepted that the remaining chapters of Genesis were equally non-historical. At the same time, archaeology and comparative sociology convinced most scholars in the field that there was equally little historical basis to the biblical stories of [[the Exodus]] and the Israelite conquest of Canaan.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=18-20}}

By the 1980s, the Bible's stories of the Patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt and Conquest of Canaan were no longer considered historical, but biblical histories continued to use the Bible as a primary source and to take the form of narrative records of political events arranged in chronological order, with the major role played by (largely Judean) kings and other high-status individuals. At the same time, new tools and approaches were being brought to bear on scholars' knowledge of the past of ancient Canaan, notably new archaeological methods and approaches (for example, this was the age of surface surveys, used to map population changes which are invisible in the biblical narrative), and the social sciences (an important work in this vein was Robert Coote and Keith Whitlam's ''The Emergence of Early Israel in Historical Perspective'', which used sociological data to argue, in contradiction to the biblical picture, that it was kingship that formed Israel, and not the other way round). 

Then in the 1990s a school of thought emerged from the background of the 1970s and 1980s which held that the entire enterprise of studying ancient Israel and its history was seriously flawed by an over-reliance on the biblical text, which was too problematic (meaning untrustworthy) to be used even selectively as a source for Israel's past, and that Israel itself was in any case itself a problematic subject. This movement came to be known as biblical minimalism.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=27-33}}

==Biblical minimalism==
The scholars that have come to be called "minimalists" are not a unified group, and in fact deny that they form a group or "school": Philip Davies points out that while he argues that the bulk of the Bible can be dated to the Persian period (the 5th century BCE), Niels Peter Lemche prefers the Hellenistic period (3rd to 2nd centuries BCE), while Whitelam has not given any opinion at all. Similarly, while Lemche holds that the [[Tel Dan stele]] (an inscription from the mid-9th century BCE which seems to mention the name of [[David]]) is probably a forgery, Davies and Whitelam do not. In short, the minimalists do not agree on much more than that the Bible is a doubtful source of information about ancient Israel.{{sfn|Davies|n.d.|}}

===Bible as a historical source document===
The first of the minimalists' two central claims is based on the premise that history-writing is never objective, but involves the selection of data and the construction of a narrative using preconceived ideas of the meaning of the past&amp;mdash;the fact that history is thus never neutral or objective raises questions about the accuracy of any historical account.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=33}} The minimalists cautioned that the literary form of the biblical history books is so apparent and the authors' intentions so obvious that scholars should be extremely cautious in taking them at face value. Even if the Bible does preserve some accurate information, researchers lack the means to sift that information from the inventions with which it may have been mixed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=34-35}} 

The minimalists did not claim that the Bible is useless as a historical source; rather, they suggest that its proper use is in understanding the period in which it was written, a period which some of them place in the Persian period (5th–4th centuries BCE) and others in the Hellenistic period (3rd–2nd centuries).{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=35}}

===Historicity of the nation of Israel===
The second claim is that "Israel" itself is a difficult idea to define in terms of historiography. There is, firstly, the idealised Israel which the Bible authors created&amp;mdash;"biblical Israel". In the words of Niels Peter Lemche: 
{{quote|''The Israelite nation as explained by the biblical writers has little in the way of a historical background. It is a highly ideological construct created by ancient scholars of Jewish tradition in order to legitimize their own religious community and its religio-political claims on land and religious exclusivity.''| {{Harvnb|Lemche|1998|pp=165–66}} }}
Modern scholars have taken aspects of biblical Israel and married them with data from archaeological and non-biblical sources to create their own version of a past Israel&amp;mdash;"Ancient Israel". Neither bears much relationship to the kingdom destroyed by Assyria in about 722 BCE&amp;mdash;"historical Israel". The real subjects for history-writing in the modern period are either this historical Israel or else the biblical Israel, the first a historical reality and the second an intellectual creation of the biblical authors. Linked with this was the observation that modern biblical scholars had concentrated their attentions exclusively on [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and their religious history, while ignoring the fact that these had been only a fairly insignificant part of a wider whole.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36}}

==Important works==
*''In Search of Ancient Israel'' (Philip R. Davies, 1992){{sfn|Davies|1995|p=}}
Davies' book "popularised the scholarly conversation and crystallised the import of the emerging scholarly positions" regarding the history of Israel between the 10th and 6th centuries—in other words, it summarised current research and thinking rather than proposing anything original. It was, nevertheless, a watershed work in that it drew together the new interpretations that were emerging from archaeology: the study of texts, sociology and anthropology. Davies argued that scholars needed to distinguish between the three meanings of the word Israel: the historical ancient kingdom of that name (historical Israel); the idealised Israel of the biblical authors writing in the Persian era and seeking to unify the post-exilic Jerusalem community by creating a common past (biblical Israel); and the Israel that had been created by modern scholars over the past century or so by blending together the first two (which he termed ancient Israel, in recognition of the widespread use of this phrase in scholarly histories). "Ancient Israel", he argued, was especially problematic: biblical scholars ran the risk of placing far too much confidence in their reconstructions through relying too heavily on "biblical Israel", the Bible's highly ideological version of a society that had already ceased to exist when the bulk of the biblical books reached their final form.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36, 291-292}}

*''The Invention of Ancient Israel'' (Keith Whitelam, 1996){{sfn|Whitelam|1996|p=}}
Subtitled "The Silencing of Palestinian History", Whitelam criticised his peers for their concentration on Israel and Judah to the exclusion of the many other peoples and kingdoms that had existed in Iron Age Palestine. Palestinian history for the period from 13th century BCE to the 2nd century CE had been ignored, and scholars had concentrated instead on political, social, and above all religious developments in the small entity of Israel. This, he argued, supported the contemporary claim to the land of Palestine by the descendants of Israel, while keeping biblical studies in the realm of religion rather than history.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=37}}

*''The Israelites in History and Tradition'' (Niels Peter Lemche, 1998){{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=}}

*''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' ([[Thomas L. Thompson]], 1999){{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=}}
The subtitle of the US edition of ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' was "Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel", a phrase almost guaranteed to cause controversy in America. The European title, ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past]]'', was perhaps more descriptive of its actual theme: the need to treat the Bible as literature rather than as history—"The Bible's language is not a historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction." This was Thompson's attempt to set the minimalist position before a wider public; it became the cause of a rejoinder by William Dever, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', which in turn led to a bitter public dispute between the two.

==Reception and influence==
The ideas of the minimalists generated considerable controversy during the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century. Some conservative scholars reacted defensively, attempting to show that the details of the Bible were in fact consistent with having been written by contemporaries (against the minimalist claim that they were largely the work of the Persian or Hellenistic periods). A notable work in this camp was Kenneth Kitchen's ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Taking a different approach, ''[[A Biblical History of Israel]]'', by [[Iain Provan]], [[V. Philips Long]], and [[Tremper Longman III]], argued that criterion of distrust set by the minimalists (the Bible should be regarded as unreliable unless directly confirmed by external sources) was unreasonable, and that it should be regarded as reliable unless directly falsified. Avi Hurvitz compared biblical Hebrew with the Hebrew from ancient inscriptions and found it consistent with the period before the Persian period, thus questioning the key minimalist contention that the biblical books were written several centuries after the events they describe.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=38}} [[Takamitsu Muraoka]] also argues against the hypothesis that the entire Hebrew Bible was composed in the Persian period, associated with some minimalists like Davies, countering that there are specifically late Biblical Hebrew features, like some rare plene spellings, that are contained in books dated to the Persian era by minimalists as well, but unusual or absent elsewhere.{{sfn|Muraoka|2006|p=9, n. 2}}

In the scholarly mainstream a growing number see significant contradictions between the Bible's version of history and reality. Some who continue to take the Bible for their framework see it as having less reliability as the level of detail increases. In consequence, the study of Israel's past has now moved beyond the minimalist/maximalist debate. Historians of ancient Israel have adapted their methodologies by relying less on the Bible and more on sociological models and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39, 291}} Scholars such as [[Lester L. Grabbe]] (''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'', 2007), [[Victor H. Matthews]] (''Studying the Ancient Israelites: A Guide to Sources and Methods'', 2007), and Hans Barstad (''History and the Hebrew Bible'', 2008) simply put the evidence before the reader and explain the issues, rather than attempt to write histories; others such as K.L. Knoll (''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity'', 2001) attempt to include Israel in a broader treatment of Syria-Palestine/Canaan. This is not to say that the ideas of the minimalists are completely adopted in modern study of ancient Israel: Mario Liverani, for example (''Israel's History and the History of Israel'', 2005), accepts that the biblical sources are from the Persian period, but believes that the minimalists have not truly understood that context nor recognised the importance of the ancient sources used by the authors. Thus positions that do not fit either a minimalist or a maximalist position are now being expressed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39}}

}}'''Biocybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[biological science]], composed of biological disciplines that benefit from the application of cybernetics including [[neurology]] and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in [[systems biology]], seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function.

Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of [[theoretical biology]], based upon the principles of [[systemics]].

== Terminology ==
Biocybernetics is a conjoined word from bio (Greek: βίο / life) and [[cybernetics]] (Greek: κυβερνητική / controlling-governing). Although the extended form of the word is biological cybernetics, the field is most commonly referred to as biocybernetics in scientific papers. Bioinformatics may also be properly referred to as bio informatics.

== Early proponents ==
Early proponents of biocybernetics include Ross Ashby, Hans Drischel, and Norbert Wiener among others. Popular papers published by each scientist are listed below.

[[W. Ross Ashby|Ross Ashby, "Introduction to Cybernetics", 1956]]&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Ross Ashby]], ''Introduction to Cybernetics''. Methuen, London, UK, 1956.  [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf PDF text].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener, "Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine", 1948]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Wiener]], ''Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', (Hermann &amp; Cie Editeurs, Paris, The Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar fields ==
Papers and research that delve into topics involving biocybernetics may be found under a multitude of similar names, including molecular cybernetics, neurocybernetics, and cellular cybernetics. Such fields involve disciplines that specify certain aspects of the study of the living organism (for example, neurocybernetics focuses on the study neurological models in organisms).

== Categories ==
* Biocybernetics – the study of an entire living organism
* [[Neurocybernetics]] – cybernetics dealing with neurological models. (''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' was the title of a self-help book, and is not a scientific discipline)
* Molecular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with molecular systems (e.g. molecular biology cybernetics)
* Cellular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with cellular systems (e.g. information technology/cell phones or biological cells)
* Evolutionary cybernetics – study of the evolution of informational systems (See also [[evolutionary programming]], [[evolutionary algorithm]])

[[File:Pitch class space star.svg|thumb|For comparison, the chromatic scale produced by an aliquant bisector or generator, the perfect fifth, creating a circle of fifths]]

In [[diatonic set theory]], a '''bisector''' divides the [[octave]] approximately in half (the equal tempered [[tritone]] is exactly half the octave) and may be used in place of a [[generated collection|generator]] to derive [[Set (music)|collections]] for which [[structure implies multiplicity]] is not true such as the [[ascending melodic minor]], [[harmonic minor]], and [[octatonic scale]]s. Well formed generated collections generators and bisectors coincide, such as the [[perfect fifth]] ([[circle of fifths]]) in the [[diatonic collection]]. The term was introduced by [[Jay Rahn]] (1977), who considers any division between one and two thirds as approximately half ([[major third]] to [[minor sixth]] or 400 to 800 cents) and who applied the term only the equally spaced collections. Clough and Johnson both adapt the term to apply to [[generic interval|generic scale steps]]. Rahn also uses '''''aliquant bisector''''' for bisectors which may be used to generate every note in a collection, in which case the bisector and the number of notes must be [[coprime]]. Bisectors may be used to produce the [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[harmonic minor]], and [[ascending melodic minor]] collections. (Johnson 2003, p.97, 101, 158n10-12)

The diatonic scale may be derived from a chain of perfect fifths:
  P5 P5 P5 P5 P5
 F  C  G  D  A  B = C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C.
 5, 0, 7, 2, 9, e = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, e, 0.
  +7 +7 +7 +7 +7 (mod 12)

For example, the octatonic scale may be derived similarly to derivations of the diatonic scale by a chain of perfect fifths (a generator), by using a bisector of 5 scale steps (3 may also be used). However, five steps in the octatonic scale alternates between 7 and 8 semitones, so it is a bisector and not a generator:
  A5 P5 A5 P5 A5 P5 A5 P5
 C  Ab Eb B  Gb D  A  F  C = C  D  Eb F  Gb Ab A  B  C.
 0, 8, 3, e, 6, 2, 9, 5, 0 = 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, e, 0.
  +8 +7 +8 +7 +8 +7 +8 +7

The '''Castrol Technology Centre''' is a research institute owned by [[BP]] in [[South Oxfordshire]], north of [[Whitchurch-on-Thames]].

==History==
===Castrol===
Castrol was founded by [[Charles Wakefield, 1st Viscount Wakefield|C.C.Wakefield]] in 1899, making lubricants (Wakefield lubricator) for railways. 

The research site opened in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castrol.com/content/dam/castrolcountry/ja_jp/aboutus/pangbourne/article_20151027.pdf Castrol history]&lt;/ref&gt; The site was purchased by Castrol in 1976.

'''Chennai Mathematical Institute''' ('''CMI''') is a research and education institute in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. It was founded by the [[SPIC (Indian company)|SPIC]] Science Foundation in 1989, and offers undergraduate as well as postgraduate programmes in [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]], besides its key strength in the form of high-end research in Mathematics.&lt;ref name="nfhindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/02/stories/2007020219490300.htm|title=New Facilities for CMI|author=Special Correspondent|date=2007-02-02|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate =2010-02-13|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMI is noted for its research in the field of [[algebraic geometry]], in particular in the area of [[moduli space|moduli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/52129/Future+in+the+making.html?page=1|title=Future in the making|author=Banumathi Krishnaswamy|date=2009-07-16|publisher=India Today|accessdate =2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of bundles.

CMI was earlier located in [[T. Nagar]] in the heart of Chennai in an office complex. It moved to a new {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus in [[Siruseri]] in October 2005.&lt;ref name="cmicampus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in//about/campus.php|title=Campus|publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, CMI was recognized as a university under Section 3 of the UGC Act 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UGC Act-1956|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload_document/ugc_act.pdf|website=mhrd.gov.in/|publisher=Secretary, University Grants Commission|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a [[deemed university]].&lt;ref name="nfhindu"/&gt; Until then, the teaching program was offered in association with [[Madhya Pradesh Bhoj Open University|Bhoj Open University]], as it offered more flexibility.

==History==
[[File:The-campus-of-CMI.jpg|thumb|261x261px|CMI Main Building]]
[[File:Chennai Mathematical Institute main building greenery at night 3.JPG|thumb|CMI Academic Block|260x260px]]
CMI began as the School of Mathematics, SPIC Science Foundation, in 1989. The SPIC Science Foundation was set up in 1986 by [[SPIC (Indian company)|Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation]] (SPIC) Ltd., one of the major industrial houses in India, to foster the growth of science and technology in the country.

In 1996, the School of Mathematics became an independent institution and changed its name to SPIC Mathematical Institute. In 1998, in order to better reflect the emerging role of the institute, it was renamed the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI).

From its inception, the institute has had a Ph.D programme in Mathematics and Computer Science. In the initial years, the Ph.D programme was affiliated to the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani and the University of Madras. In December 2006, CMI was recognized as a university under Section 3 of the UGC Act 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in//about/history.php|title=History|publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, CMI took the initiative to bridge the gap between teaching and research by starting B.Sc.(Hons.) and M.Sc. programmes in Mathematics and allied subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/08/07/stories/2004080709130400.htm|title=Kakodkar cautions against missing research-technology connectivity|author=Special Correspondent|date=2004-08-07|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the B.Sc. programme was extended to incorporate two courses with research components, leading to an M.Sc. degree in Mathematics and an M.Sc degree in Computer Science. In 2003, a new undergraduate course was added, leading to a B.Sc. degree in Physics.

In 2010, CMI launched a summer fellowship programme whereby they invited about 30 students from all over [[India]] to work under the faculty at CMI on various research projects.

Later, in 2012, the B.Sc. degree in Physics was restructured as an integrated B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Physics.

==Campus==
CMI moved into its new campus on {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land at the [[SIPCOT IT Park|SIPCOT Information Technology Park]] in [[Siruseri]] in October, 2005. The campus is located along the [[Old Mahabalipuram Road]], which is developing as the IT corridor to the south of the city. 



The library block and the student's hostel were completed in late 2006 and become operational from January 2007.[[File:Auditorium building.jpg|thumb|Auditorium Building|259x259px]]

In 2006, CMI implemented [[grey water]] recycling system on its campus. The system was designed for CMI by Sultan Ahmed Ismail to treat waste water produced after cleaning, washing and bathing to be used for gardening or ground water recharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/22/stories/2006052215910400.htm|title=Grey water recycling in Mathematics Institute|author=Staff reporter|date=2006-05-22|accessdate=2010-02-13|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction is underway for a new building that will house an auditorium, accommodation for guests, as well as additional academic space - faculty offices, library and lecture halls. This construction is funded by a grant from the Ministry of Human Resource Development through the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]].&lt;ref name="cmicampus" /&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

==Educational programmes==
[[File:CMI library 9.JPG|thumb|Library|249x249px]]

===Course===
CMI has Ph.D. programmes in Computer Sciences, Mathematics and Physics. Recently, CMI has introduced the possibility of students pursuing a part-time Ph.D. at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmi.ac.in//teaching/phd.php PhD Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, CMI has offered a B.Sc.(Hons) degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. This three-year program also includes courses in Humanities and Physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmi.ac.in//teaching/bscm.php&lt;/ref&gt; Many students, after completion of the B.Sc. degree, have pursued higher studies in Mathematics and Computer Sciences from universities both in India and abroad. Some students also go into industry while others take up subjects such as finance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmi.ac.in//teaching/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Computer lab in Chennai Mathematical Institute.JPG|thumb|Computer lab|249x249px]]In 2001, CMI began separate M.Sc. programmes in Mathematics and in Computer Science. In 2009, CMI began to offer a new programme M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, which is scheduled to be replaced with a new M.Sc. in Data Science programme in 2018.

In 2003, CMI introduced a new three-year programme in the form of a B.Sc.(Hons) degree in Physics. The course topics are largely in theoretical physics. CMI now has its own physics laboratory. From the academic year 2007-2008, the Physics students are having regular lab courses right from the first year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmi.ac.in//teaching/bscp.php&lt;/ref&gt;
In the academic year 2005-2006, lab sessions for third-year students were conducted at [[IIT Madras]] based on an agreement.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In the summer following their first year, physics students go to [[HBCSE]] (under [[TIFR]]) in [[Mumbai]] for practical sessions and in the second year, they go to [[IGCAR]], [[Kalpakkam]].&lt;ref name="cmi.ac.in"&gt;http://www.cmi.ac.in/admissions/cmi-brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012, the B.Sc. degree in Physics was restructured as an integrated B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Physics.

Degrees for the B.Sc. and M.Sc. programmes were earlier offered by [[MPBOU]], the Madhya Pradesh Bhoj Open University and doctoral degrees by [[Madras University]]. After CMI became a deemed university, it gives its own degrees. CMI awarded its first official degrees in August 2007.

The batch sizes typically vary from five to twenty five and the overall strength of CMI is about 100–125 students and 40–50 faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmi.ac.in//people/academic.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all the CMI programmes are run in conjunction and coordination with programmes at [[Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai|IMSc]], an institute for research in Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Physics, located in [[Chennai]].

===Admission criteria===
The entrance to each of these courses is based on a nationwide entrance test. The advertisement for this entrance test appears around the end of February or the beginning of March. The entrance test is held in the end of May and is usually scheduled so as not to clash with major entrance examinations. Results are given to students by the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/admissions/|title=Admissions|publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who have passed the [[INMO|Indian National Mathematics Olympiad]] get direct admission to the programme B.Sc.(Hons.) in Mathematics and Computer Science, and those who have passed the [[INPhO|Indian National Physics Olympiad]]  are offered direct entry to the B.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics programme. However, these students are also advised to fill in and send the application form some time in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/about/reports/cmi-annual-report-2005-2006.pdf|title=CMI Annual Report 2005-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who pass the [[Indian National Olympiad in Informatics]] may be granted admission to the B.Sc.(Hons.) Mathematics and Computer Science programme. Admission is not guaranteed but is decided on a case-by-case basis by the admissions committee.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Fee structure and other payments===

Till 2018, all students, including undergraduate students, were given a stipend to meet their monthly expenses. The tuition was waived for students in good academic standing. In 2018, the fees were increased for all students with waivers available for students in good academic standing.

{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian art''' is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from [[Christianity]]. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had [[Aniconism in Christianity|strong objections to some forms of religious image]], and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
{{main|Early Christian art and architecture}}
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century.  The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and show the evolution of the [[depiction of Jesus]], a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.

Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.  Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style  from the  classical tradition inherited from [[Ancient Greek art]] to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of [[gothic art]].

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval art}}
[[File:Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|12th-century Byzantine mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] showing the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]].]]
Much of the art surviving from [[Europe]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] is Christian art, although this in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works.  While the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of [[Rome]], its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day [[Roman Catholic Church]] commissioned  and funded production of religious art imagery.

The [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]], which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving [[Eastern Empire]] was key in commissioning  imagery there and glorifying Christianity. As a stable Western European society emerged during the [[Middle Ages]], the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine Empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people.  Realistic perspective, proportions, light and color were ignored in favor of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events.  The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|280px|[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] (1498).]]
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as [[icon]]s regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.

In the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be commissioned  in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy.  The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

Artists were commissioned more secular genres like [[portrait]]s, [[landscape painting]]s and because of  the revival of Neoplatonism,  subjects from [[classical mythology]].  In Catholic countries, production continued, and increased during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before.  From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.

===Modern period===
As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal.  Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]).  However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Dali]] is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/resources/DaliandReligion.pdf |title=Dali and Religion |work=National Gallery of Victoria, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]] and [[John August Swanson]]. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Gregory|title=Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age|year=2011|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|isbn=978-1-933859-88-0|pages=278|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Will-Save-World-Ideological/dp/1933859881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular devotional art===
Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular [[Christian culture]]. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

== Participants ==

* [[University of Trento]] (Università degli Studi di Trento)
* [[University of Turin]] (Università degli Studi di Torino)
* [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] (Università "Cà Foscari" di Venezia)

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

'''Developmental disorders''' comprise a group of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233&gt;{{cite book |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405145498.html |title = Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Fifth Edition |publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd |editors = Michael Rutter, Dorothy V.

Pine, Stephen Scott, Jim Stevenson, Eric Taylor, Anita Thapar |others = Dorothy Bishop and Michael Rutter |year = 2008 |pages = 32–33 |isbn = 978-1-4051-4549-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most narrow concept is used in the category "Specific Disorders of Psychological Development" in the [[ICD-10]].&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; These disorders comprise [[language disorder]]s, [[learning disorder]]s, [[Developmental coordination disorder|motor disorders]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm|title=ICD 10|website=priory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broader definitions [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] is included, and the term used is [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; Yet others include [[antisocial behavior]] and [[schizophrenia]] that begins in childhood and continues through life.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

Developmental disorders are present from early life. Most improve as the child grows older, but some entail impairments that continue throughout life. There is a strong genetic component; more males are afflicted than females.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

==Emergence==
Learning disabilities are diagnosed when the children are young and just beginning school. Most learning disabilities are found under the age of 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = National, Disabilities Learning | year = 1982 | title = Learning disabilities: Issues on definition | url = | journal = Asha | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 945–947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young children with communication disorders may not speak at all, or may have a limited vocabulary for their age.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;Communication Disorders. (n.d.). Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, WI, Retrieved December 6, 2011, from http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/&lt;/ref&gt; Some children with communication disorders have difficulty understanding simple directions or are unable to name objects.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Most children with communication disorders are able to speak by the time they enter school, however, they continue to have problems with communication.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; School-aged children often have problems understanding and formulating words.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Teens may have more difficulty with understanding or expressing abstract ideas.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

=== Causes ===
The scientific study of the causes of developmental disorders involves many different theories. Some of the major differences between these theories involves whether or not environment disrupts normal development, or if abnormalities are pre-determined.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karmiloff Annette | year = | title = Development itself is key to understanding developmental disorders | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661398012303 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences| volume =  2| issue = | pages =  389–398| doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01230-3 | pmid=21227254 | date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Normal development occurs with a combination of contributions from both the environment and genetics. The theories vary in the part each factor has to play in normal development, thus affecting how the abnormalities are caused.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"/&gt;

One theory that supports environmental causes of developmental disorders involves stress in early childhood. Researcher and child psychiatrist [[Bruce D. Perry|Bruce D. Perry, M.D., Ph.D]], theorizes that developmental disorders can be caused by early childhood traumatization.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"&gt;Perry, Bruce D. and Szalavitz, Maia. "The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog", Basic Books, 2006, p.2. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works he compares developmental disorders in traumatized children to adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, linking extreme environmental stress to the cause of developmental difficulties.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"/&gt; Other stress theories suggest that even small stresses can accumulate to result in emotional, behavioral, or social disorders in children.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Kim John. “Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids”, Ballantine Books, 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|9780345507983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They estimated that about one in 300 children are born with spontaneous genetic mutations associated with rare developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38691622|title=Child gene study identifies new developmental disorders|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|date=2017-01-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)===
====Diagnosis====
The first diagnosed case of ASD was published in 1943 by American psychiatrist [[Leo Kanner]].  There is a wide range of cases and severity to ASD so it is very hard to detect the first signs of ASD. A diagnosis of ASD can be made accurately before the child is 3 years old, but the diagnosis of ASD is not commonly confirmed until the child is somewhat older. The age of diagnosis can range from 9 months to 14 years, and the mean age is 4 years old in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/hunting-autisms-earliest-clues|title=Hunting for Autism&amp;#039;s Earliest Clues|date=18 September 2013|website=Autism Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average each case of ASD is tested at three different diagnostic centers before confirmed. Early diagnosis of the disorder can diminish familial stress, speed up referral to special educational programs and influence family planning.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"&gt;Dereu, Mieke. (2010). ''Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Flemish Day-Care Centers with the Checklist for Early Signs of Developmental Disorders.'' Springer Science+Business Media. 1247-1258.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the brain====
The cause of ASD is still uncertain. Autism spectrum disorder is a disorder of the cortex, which controls higher functions, sensation, muscle movements, and memory. What is known is that a child with ASD has a pervasive problem with how the brain is wired. The distribution of white matter, the nerve fibers that link diverse parts of the brain, is abnormal. An ASD child’s brain grows at a very rapid rate and is almost fully grown by the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt; Recent fMRI studies have also found altered connectivity within the social brain areas due to ASD and may be related to the social impairments encountered in ASD.&lt;ref name="Gotts et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Brain |year=2012 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=2711-2725 |title= Fractionation of social brain circuits in autism spectrum disorders |author= Gotts S. J., Simmons W. K., Milbury L. A., Wallace G. L., Cox R. W., Martin A. |pmid= 22791801|doi=10.1093/brain/aws160 |pmc=3437021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symptoms====
Still a lot of information is unclear about ASD and the symptoms have a wide range of severity. Signs include impairments in social interactions, communication and repetitive or restricted patterns of interest or behaviors. There are also different symptoms at different ages based on developmental milestones. Children between 0 and 36 months with ASD show a lack of eye contact, seem to be deaf, lack a social smile, do not like being touched or held, have unusual sensory behavior and show a lack of imitation. Children between 12 and 24 months with ASD show a lack of gestures, prefer to be alone, do not point to objects to indicate interest, are easily frustrated with challenges, and lack of functional play. And finally children between the ages 24 to 36 months with ASD show a lack of symbolic play and an unusual interest in certain objects, or moving objects.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

====Treatment====
There is no cure for ASD and proper treatment depends on the case and what is most struggled with. Autism spectrum disorder is like many other disorders where when diagnosed early, can be better treated. Different types of therapy are helpful such as music therapy and physical therapy. Other treatments include [[auditory integration training|auditory training]], discrete trial training, [[facilitated communication]], and [[sensory integration therapy]].&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)===
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] that is characterised by significant levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsiveness. There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive, and combined (which presents as both hyperactive and inattentive subtypes).&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"&gt;Tresco, Katy E. (2004). ''Attention Deficit Disorders: School-Based Interventions.'' Pennsylvania: Bethlehem.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment options====
Treatment of ADHD often includes a combination of psychological, behavioural, pharmaceutical and educational advice and interventions.

Medications commonly used in the treatment of ADHD are primarily [[stimulant]]s such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[lisdexamphetamine]] and non-stimulants such as [[atomoxetine]].

[[SSRI]] antidepressants may be unhelpful, and could worsen symptoms of ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However ADHD is often misdiagnosed as depression, particularly when no hyperactivity is present.

====Symptoms====
Symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Many of the behaviors that are associated with ADHD include poor control over actions resulting in disruptive behavior and academic problems. Another area that is affected by these disorders is the social arena for the person with the disorder. Many children that have this disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships and struggle to fit in socially with their peers.&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="837">'''Eidonomy''' is the study of the external appearance of an [[organism]]. It is thus the opposite of [[anatomy]], which refers to internal [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].l
While predominant early in the [[history of biology]] it is little studied in particular anymore as it is rife with the effects of [[convergent evolution]]. It thus yields less new information about organisms than anatomy, and therefore the external appearance of lifeforms is usually studied as part of general investigations in morphology, e.g. in the context of [[phylogenetic]] research.

&lt;!-- Do not remove this line! --&gt;
&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

The '''Groupes Bibliques Universitaires''' ('''GBU''') are student groups that meet at universities or nearby for in-depth [[Bible]] study. They were founded in the beginning of the 20th century and currently operate in an officially recognized way in more than 154 countries, with a presence in 168 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where we work|url=http://www.ifesworld.org/en/our-work|website=Ifesworld.org|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the GBU is to discuss  Biblical texts and to make the [[Bible]] known in the academic world. Though they have a clear [[evangelical Christian]] orientation, those groups are non-denominational and are open to all students.&lt;ref name="Fath Ghetto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fath|first1=Sebastien|title=Du ghetto au réseau : le protestantisme évangélique en France (1800-2005)|date=2005|publisher=Labor et Fides|location=Geneve|isbn=9782830911398|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=16}}&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;"Article 10 : Caractère non ecclésial de l'association", Statuts de l'Association des Groupes Bibliques universitaires de France, 2006 (in French)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[France|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] GBU are [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students#History|founding members]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterVarsity's History|url=https://intervarsity.org/about/our/history|website=intervarsity.org|accessdate=6 October 2016|quote=In 1947 InterVarsity USA became a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, a federation of national Christian student movements.

== Origins of the GBU ==
=== Forerunners ===
In   17th century   [[Scotland]], groups of students began to meet on their own initiative in order to study the [[Bible]] and pray together.&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Keith|last2=Hunt|first2=Gladys|title=For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A./ 1940-1990|date=1991|publisher=InterVarsity Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=28}}&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Lindsay|title=Une Nuée de témoins|date=2013|publisher=PBU|location=Paris|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=31}} Similar groups were reported in England and then in the United States of America in the 18th century under a variety of names. The goal of those “societies” was mainly to grow in faith through prayer, exhortation and the discussion of theological subjects. They were often kept secret&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF" /&gt;{{rp|page=33}} to avoid   the suspicion of excessive spiritualism.

At the same time in continental Europe, German [[pietism]]And its extensions had a huge impact among students with an emphasis on witnessing and evangelism. This concern grew in several groups in America in the beginning of the 19th century. It resulted in remarkable missionary commitments within the large missionary societies which had been created over the previous century.   A need  was felt to establish relationships between universities.  It was also the time of the great awakenings which occurred in many European countries, paving the way for more interdenominational cooperation and alliances.

During the second half of the 19th century, several evangelical youth organisations developed worldwide with significant ramifications among students (e.g. [[Young Men's Christian Associations|Young Men’s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Y : History - Founding|url=http://www.ymca.net/history/founding.html|website=ymca.net|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Young Women's Christian Association|Young women’s]] Christian Associations). Following its predecessors, the emphasis on global mission increased considerably&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}} (e.g. [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]]&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|pages=38–40}}).

=== The first GBU ===
The foundation of the organization  has been traced back to 1877&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF"/&gt;{{rp|page=32}}&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}} with the creation in [[Cambridge University]]  of the  [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] (Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterVarsity's History|url=https://intervarsity.org/about/our/history|website=intervarsity.org|accessdate=6 October 2016|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors had prepared the ground: a strong evangelical presence in the University for a century, a Missionary Union that had been encouraged by [[David Livingstone]]&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF" /&gt;{{rp|page=31}} and prayer meetings that had been held on a daily basis for several years. In 1873,  groups in London hospitals founded the Medical Prayer Union. With the [[Christian Union (students)|Christian Union]] in Oxford, which had been founded in 1881, all those groups created the [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|SCM]] (Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|Student Christian Movement).

Similar movements developed in other countries, especially in the English-speaking world. They joined together into a world evangelical and missionary federation : the [[World Student Christian Federation|WSCF]] (World Student Christian Federation).

An heir of 19th century rationalism, [[Liberal Christianity|theological liberalism]] or modernism exerted growing influence over many churches and thus over Christian organisations. Little by little, the line of the founders was set aside, with its emphasis on the primacy of the Gospel and on the authority of the Scriptures.

The [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|SCM]]’s responsiveness to the new ideas resulted in serious differences of views. In 1910, the [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] was therefore sidelined because it wanted to remain faithful to the biblical foundations. From then on, the two movements developed independently.

After the shock of the First World War, the activities of [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] and similar groups resumed. The movement expanded progressively to a great number of universities in Great Britain. In places, some common ground could be found with the [[World Student Christian Federation|WSCF]], but the split was complete a few years later due to serious ideological drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Keith|last2=Hunt|first2=Gladys|title=For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A./ 1940-1990|date=1991|publisher=InterVarsity Press|location=USA|pages=39–55|chapter=The rise and fall of the Student Christian Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, some GBU are involved in [[Christian humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Legaré|first1=Isabelle|title=Études salées et légumes en conserve|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/actualites/chroniques/isabelle-legare/201602/09/01-4948894-etudes-salees-et-legumes-en-conserve.php|website=La Presse|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=fr-CA|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The GBU in France ==
=== Organization ===
In [[France]], the GBU are also called AGBUF (Association des Groupes Bibliques Universitaires de France),  constituted in accordance with the French law of 1901 concerning  [[Nonprofit organization#France|non-profit organisations]]. They bring together students who are eager to study the [[Bible]]. They provide them with the opportunity to meet at or around universities and to deepen their knowledge together with other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website of the French GBU|url=http://gbu.fr|website=gbu.fr|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local groups are run autonomously. The GBU is a student organisation. All its student activities are under the responsibility of the Student Executive Committee which reports to a supervisory board, the National Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbu.fr/presentation/l-organisation|title=Organisation|website=gbu.fr|language=FR|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main activity is reading the Bible together. Meetings are open to all and everyone is free to share his beliefs concerning the Scriptures. At the international level, the French GBU are a [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students#History|founding member]] of [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students|IFES]] (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.ifesworld.org/en/our-history|website=Ifesworld.org|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “Union des GBU de France” was officially established in 1950.

The [[May 1968 events in France|events of 1968]] sent shock waves that tremendously affected university life and reverberated within the GBU. The following decade was one of unprecedented development. Groups multiplied, more students were committed and became members of the GBU, large Easter congresses were organised, more people were contacted  In 1976, the PBU ([http://pbu.gbu.fr Presses Bibliques Universitaires]) were established jointly with the Swiss and Belgian GBUs. Books were published on  issues such as culture, ideologies, nuclear power, poetry, etc.

Around 1,000 students currently gather weekly in over 90 groups in [[France]]. In [[Romandy|Swiss Romande]], around 600 students meet every week in about 50 groups.

=== Supporters ===
When they have finished their studies, students are invited to remain members of AGBUF in order to ensure the continuity of the movement and its development.

The Friends of the GBU used to be organised in a separate organisation. The AGBUF is now made both of students who take an active role in local groups and of post-graduates. The latter are willing to help maintain and develop the movement they entered during their studies. These post-graduates and friends are invited to create local support groups in order to help to develop local GBU groups.

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==
{{See also|Heckler's veto}}
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory''' ({{lang-de|'''Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl'''}}) is a historic [[astronomical observatory]] located near the summit of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] hill in the city of [[Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]]. The predecessor of the current observatory was originally opened in 1774 in the nearby city of [[Mannheim]] but degradation of observational conditions there resulted in a relocation to the Königstuhl in 1898.&lt;ref name=wpde&gt;This article incorporates information from the [[:de:Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory forms part of the [[Center of Astronomy (University of Heidelberg)|Center of Astronomy]] of the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]]. The [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]] opened on an adjacent site in 1967.&lt;ref name="wpde"/&gt; Prof. Dr. Andreas Quirrenbach is the observatory's director since 2005.

== History ==

The instrumentation of the observatory originated from the [[Mannheim Observatory]], founded in 1774. In 1880 the observatory was provisionally moved to [[Karlsruhe]] because the astronomical/atmospherical [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions worsened. In subsequent years, three other locations were considered, with Heidelberg-[[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] finally being chosen.

On 20 June 1898 the "Großherzogliche Bergsternwarte" was ceremonially inaugurated by [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden]]. The astronomical institute comprised two complementary departments, the astrophysical, led by [[Max Wolf]], and the [[Astrometry|astrometrical]] led by [[Karl Wilhelm Valentiner]]. Valentiner was director of the Mannheim observatory and initiated the move to Karlsruhe. After Valentiner's retirement in 1909, both departments were placed under the administration of Max Wolf.

[[File:Astrograph in Heidelberg-Königstuhl-2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Bruce double astrograph'' named after [[Catherine Wolfe Bruce]]]]

While the new observatory complex was still under construction [[Max Wolf]] obtained a grant of $10,000 from the American philanthropist [[Catherine Wolfe Bruce]] for the acquisition of a powerful new dual {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[refractor telescope]], the ''Bruce double [[astrograph]]''.

The main field of activity of the observatory was the investigation of [[nebula]]e and the search for [[asteroids]]. Wolf, his staff and his successors discovered over 800 asteroids, including the first [[trojan asteroid]] [[588 Achilles|Achilles]] in 1906.

The observatory ceased to be run by the German federal government in 2005 when it was joined with the [[Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (University of Heidelberg)|Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics]] and [[Astronomical Calculation Institute (University of Heidelberg)|Astronomical Calculation Institute]] to make up the [[Center of Astronomy (University of Heidelberg)|Center of Astronomy]] of the [[University of Heidelberg]].

Between 1912 and 1957 [[Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth]] discovered almost 400 [[asteroid]]s from the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory.

The '''International Business and Economic Research Center''' (IBERC), was a company which provided advice, research and analysis on a variety of trade related issues including [[trade preference]] programs, [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing strategies]] and [[trade agreement]] negotiations, principally in the area of textiles and apparel. IBERC's principal products comprised a Quota Management Service and consulting capabilities to help users to make use of the data. IBERC clients included principally apparel and textile producing nations on the United States' quota and tariff system.

==Overview==
IBERC quota management system (database) was founded in the 1960s by lawyer, and former U.S. Army officer, Michael P. Davis. The firm broke up in 1986, when the chief executive, a recently retired [[U.S. Department of Commerce|United States Department of Commerce]] official, was investigated 1986 by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] for alleged activities on behalf of the Government of [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4308406.html|title="Some IBERC execs quit as US probes Lenahan". Highbeam News Corp. (Walter Lenahan; International Business and Economic Research Corp.), July 18, 1986|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engagingnews.us/select/International-Business-and-Economic-Research-Corp.html "Eye Mudge Rose-IBERC Israeli activities", Daily News Record (Thu, 31 Jul 1986) (International Business and Economic Research Corp., textile issue activities)]&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of the U.S. [[Foreign Agents Registration Act ]] Dating-from the early 1990s, the IBERC database materials were managed by several different U.S. legal firms dealing with customs and trade affairs. i.e. the IBERC ceased to be a corporate entity, and remained as a product line offered by U.S.-based legal firms operating in the trade domain.

The principal use of IBERC's quota management system was by governments, dealing with the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] (MFA) which was managed under the [[GATT]] (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), i.e. principal clients were either textiles manufacturers in these countries, or the governments which were contracting-parties to the GATT. IBERC is used today by governments as a textiles quota database. The IBERC database is owned and managed by firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg.

== House Subcommittee investigation of IBERC ==
In 1986, the House Subcommittee On Commerce, Consumer, And Monetary Affairs Of [[United States House Committee on Government Operations|The Government Operations Committee]] investigated IBERC Vice President Walter Lenahan, verifying his compliance with ethics laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/heinz/box00158/fld00012/bdl0007/doc0002/heinz.pdf | title=Ex-commerce official learned US position, then switched sides | date=May 22, 1986 | agency=The Washington Times | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Archibald, George | pages=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Lenahan was the former U.S. assistant secretary of Commerce for textiles and apparel, in relation to his move from the [[Commerce Department]] ([[International Trade Centre]]) to working with IBERC. The House Subcommittee investigated at that time if Mr. Lenahan had violated “conflict of interest” laws, “post employment” laws, “FARA-laws” ([[Foreign Agent Registration Act]]) laws and the subject of former U.S. ITA (International Trade Agency) officials who left-office to represent foreign governments was examined. The subcommittee concluded that Mr. Lenahan may have violated a conflict of interest provision of U.S. Federal law, i.e. 18 U.S.C. 208.

== IBERC breakup ==
In the context of the House, and a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigation, IBERC executives (themselves also former US-ITA, U.S. Department of Commerce officials) left the firm resulting in that the IBERC materials were subsumed by the new firm, International Development Systems, Inc., created by former US-ITA officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4308406.html | title=Some IBERC execs quit as US probes Lenahan. (Walter Lenahan; International Business and Economic Research Corp.) | publisher=Daily News Record | date=July 18, 1986 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Wightman, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBERC textiles quotation database was subsumed thereafter by the legal firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander and Ferdon, which operated the IBERC textiles data materials into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf |title=The torturers' lobby - How Human Rights-Abusing Nations Are Represented in Washington |accessdate=June 4, 2012 |author=Brogan, Pamela |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704124730/http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IBERC database and Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg ==
In 2003, IBERC was acquired by the firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg P.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.strtrade.com/Advisories/advisory.aspx?id=95 | title=Sandler, Travis &amp; Rosenberg, P.A. acquires IBERC to enhance information management services for textile/apparel industry clients | date=September 2, 2003 | accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gemeentehuis Tegelen.JPG|thumb|The former town hall of Tegelen]]

'''Ithaka Science Center''', a hands-on science education center in [[Tegelen]] in the [[Netherlands]] was founded in 2008 as a [[non-profit]] organization by Vaggelis E. Fragiadakis and Margriet van Tulder and funded as a [[public-private partnership]]. Its goal: to present interactive [[exhibits]], programs, public lectures, and other events for schools and the general public. 

==Building==
The [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] location at Raadhuislaan 11, in [[Tegelen]], the Netherlands, is a historic building that served as the [[city hall]] for Tegelen. The historic façade and many internal architectural details have been preserved.

==Exhibits==
A major feature of the center is a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibits that demonstrate scientific and technical principles. Exhibits are labeled in Dutch, English and in German, as the center is within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the border with Germany, and was designed to host visitors and schools from both countries. The first series of exhibits dealt with [[energy]], [[light]], and [[gravity]]. The center integrated science exhibits with art displays inspired by scientific themes. The art shown changes periodically.

==Science education==
Before the center moved into the former townhall, Ithaka created [[science education]] programs and conferences, such as energy exhibitions, science clubs, school activities, master classes, and other special events.

For classroom teachers, the Ithaka Science Center has assembled and provides science activity kits which included instruments, materials and instructions for topics including [[electricity]], [[air]], [[mechanics]], [[magnetism]], properties of [[solids]], [[liquids]] and [[gases]].

The center has hosted numerous speakers on science, [[technology]], and science education. Among them have been Nobel Laureates [[George Smoot]], [[Douglas Osheroff]], and [[Eric Maskin]].

The center has online activities for children, and had produced a children's science exploration [[television program]].

[[File:Syr-Land-Bank-property-2016-09.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse Land Bank property, [[Syracuse, New York]]]]

'''Land banking''' is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or [[land development|development]].

While in many countries ''land banking'' may refer to various private [[real-estate]] [[investment]] schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] [[County (United States)|county]] or [[Municipality|municipal]] authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land.

==Municipal land banks in the United States==
===Definition===
[[File:Urban Blight in Philadelphia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Blighted land in Philadelphia]]
Land banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of [[Urban decay|underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property]]. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank "model" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank S. Alexander |url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |title=Land Banks and Land Banking |agency=Center for Community Progress |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606080059/http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |archivedate=June  6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The period of [[deindustrialization]] in the United States coupled with increased [[suburbanization]] in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of [[Urban decay|vacant &amp; blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property]]. Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in [[St. Louis]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"/&gt; While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn’t until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County Land Bank]]. In 2009 the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse and the ensuing foreclosure crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sage Computing, Inc.|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/landbanks.pdf |title=Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: Office of Policy Development and Research |date=August 2009 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment land banking by country==

===United Kingdom===
Land banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or [[real estate developer]]s. Many reputable listed commercial [[building companies]] engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Services Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in the period 2002 – Jul 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Levene |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/nov/07/landbanking-investment-scheme |title=Land Banking – The Plot Thickens |publisher=Guardian |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landbanking scheme that is a [[Collective investment scheme]] is a "regulated activity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21#guide-mark-6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621075802/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21 |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and, according to section 19(1), may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt. Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered. After recent FSA enforcement of this regulation many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non UK residents who are not protected by FSA regulations.

====Companies offering land banking plots in the UK====
Since the changes in the land registration act, a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed. Typically this land is greenbelt, nature conservation, flood plain,  agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development. There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes.

There have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes. A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the FSA or other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-pontoon-cib-winds-up-21-companies-in-a-day-373438 |title=9 Land Banking Companies Wound Up |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/trends-events/investigations/12677184-1.html |title=Three companies are ordered into liquidation following a government investigation |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-national-high-court-orders-five-land-banking-companies-into-liquidation-391681 |title=5 Land Banking Companies Liquidated |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation. Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities, or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment. In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a warning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/publications/quick_tips/Consumer_Portal_Land_Banking.html |title=Land Banking – Look before you leap |publisher=Moneysense.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada.

====Sales methods====
A company representative may contact an individual by telephone, in temporary shopping center booths, or at [http://www.kampcrystalresidency.com property] shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK. Very often UK government or industry statistics, the proximity of the land to built up areas, or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment. Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as [[building land]]. When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak. Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site. These plans are often referred to as "pre-approved", "concept" or "predevelopment". The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price.

No reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land, or the issues involved with the long term maintenance, and collectively selling tiny plots of land. The sales price is typically uplifted 10–100 times over the current value of the land. Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process. No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person. The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected, or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations. There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe.

The investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped. Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme, the re-sale value of the individual plots collapses. This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely, or relocating to another legal jurisdiction.

For customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations, or other [[High-yield investment program|high yield investment programmes]]. Customers may also be added to [[sucker list|suckers lists]] which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor.

====Controversies====
A ''[[You and Yours]]'' documentary, first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbott |first=Melanie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6177017.stm |title=CPRE wants 'land banking' regulation |publisher=BBC News |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom, suggesting that they were scamming their customers. A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots, with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment.

A key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots, and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnmoney.co.uk/advice/advice-87.html |title=Land Banking Companies – Why the majority of them are (legal) scams |publisher=Learnmoney.co.uk |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot.

Many land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom, particularly Canada, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Malaysia. Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as [[green belt]] zoning.

In 2008, the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Philip Scott, This is Money4 June 2008, 12:00am |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=442527&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=FSA shuts down UKLI 'land banking' firm: UK Land Investments |publisher=This is Money |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to insolvency, despite having taken £69 million from 4,500 people for land plots.

The [[HM Land Registry|UK Land Registry]] issued a press release&lt;ref name="landreg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |title=Land Registry : Press notice |publisher=Landreg.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101145935/http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |archivedate=November  1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 15, 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes. Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being "misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission", with well-known banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project, and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not.

===United States===
====Government====
[[File:Syr-Land-Bank-sign.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse Land Bank sign, Syracuse, New York]]
In 2011 [[New York State]] passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated, sold or demolished in an orderly fashion. Many counties upstate including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[Schenectady County]] and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs. Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title. [http://esd.ny.gov/BusinessPrograms/Data/NYSLBP/LandBankAct_Article16NPCL.pdf] 

The recent [[robo-signing]] settlement gave Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany. [http://wamc.org/post/schneiderman-announces-land-bank-funding]

The state of [[Michigan]] also has a land bank program [http://www.michigan.gov/landbank]. [[Ohio]] passed land bank legislation in 2009.

====Commercial====
Land banking as an investment is nothing new to America. Several self-made billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen. People such as [[Bob Hope]] and [[Donald Trump]] have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold. There have however, also been many land scams in the US, such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate.

Florida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush. Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today. Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams. Polk County, being the land that lies between the city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando, in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development. North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp. The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp "land of critical state concern". During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development. The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices. These prices ranged from $2,000 to as high as $15,000 per acre. The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States. Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the U.S. borders through contracts for deed arrangements.

===Australia===
In December 2008, at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate. Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to $300,000. Under new laws active since February 2009, this monetary limit has been removed.

In March 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |title=Australia's Stevens Monitors Foreign Home Buyers as Prices Jump |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329144746/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |archivedate=March 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2010, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier. Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value, temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country, and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board, effectively eliminating this land banking loophole. However, foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff.

It is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2010/074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |title=Press Release – Government Tightens Foreign Investment Rules for Residential Housing [24/04/2010&amp;#93; |publisher=Assistant.treasurer.gov.au |date=April 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122544/http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F2010%2F074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |archivedate=July  6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 20, 2010, the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and '''Affordability''' [http://www.adhikariawasyojana2.com/]Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine ‘underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/Communique_20_April_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009063639/http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/communique_20_April_2010.pdf |archivedate=October  9, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural land banking==
[[Image:ParaguayChaco_Clearings_for_cattle_grazing.jpg|thumb|Advancing agriculture in the [[Gran Chaco|Paraguay Chaco]].]]
While most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas, in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land. The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate, topography and soil properties, where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out, would be agricultural land banking.

Such lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor, therefore prices being low. The investor anticipates that, because of the area's natural productive potential, an agricultural infrastructure (sufficient roads, specialised contractors, grain storages) will develop, with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying.

Agricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist, where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings (free hold) by domestic and foreign investors.
Typical countries for such investments during recent years have been [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]],
[[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Though the perception that the world's fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new, it received renewed public and media attention with the [[global food crisis]], when phrases like ''[[peak wheat]]'' or ''peak soil''&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Nameyo and Family, 1901, Adam Clark Vroman.jpg|thumb|[[Nampeyo]], of the [[Hopi-Tewa]] People, in 1901; with her mother, White Corn; her eldest daughter, Annie Healing; and holding her granddaughter, Rachel]]
'''Matriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.

While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]] differ in some respects. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies ''that are unambiguously matriarchal'', but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.

Matriarchies may also be confused with [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], and [[matrifocal family|matrifocal]] societies. A few people consider any non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems ([[Peggy Reeves Sanday]] favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, anthropologist, [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100164210 Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy], [[Cornell University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.

In 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of [[second-wave feminism]]. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies.

Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in [[List of feminist literature|feminist literature]]. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), matriarchy is a "form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry ''matriarchy'', as accessed November 3, 2013{{Subscription or libraries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is "female dominance".&lt;ref name="HumanityIntroCulturAnthro-9ed-p259col1"&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic discipline of [[cultural anthropology]], according to the ''OED'', matriarchy is a "culture or community in which such a system prevails"&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; or a "family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, matriarchy is "rule by women".&lt;ref name="Anthro-Haviland-8ed-p579col1"&gt;Haviland, William A., ''Anthropology'' (Ft. Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 8th ed. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-15-503578-9}})), p.&amp;nbsp;579.&lt;/ref&gt; A matriarchy is a [[society]] in which females, especially mothers, have the central roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], and control of property, but does not include a society that occasionally is led by a female for nonmatriarchal reasons or an occupation in which females generally predominate without reference to matriarchy, such as [[prostitution]] or [[auxiliary (fraternal orders)|women's auxiliaries]] of organizations run by men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] argued in 1924 that the definitions of matriarchy and patriarchy had "logical and empirical failings&amp;nbsp;.... [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful".&lt;ref&gt;Kuznar, Lawrence A., ''Reclaiming a Scientific Anthropology'' (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press (div. of Sage Publications), pbk. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-7619-9114-X}})).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a [[patriarchy]] men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men,&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Göttner-Abendroth | first = Heide | author-link = Heide Göttner-Abendroth | title = Matriarchal Society: Definition and Theory | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055107/http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html | archive-date = 19 April 2013 | url = http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html }}&lt;br /&gt;

The word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry patriarchy to entry ''matriarchy'', both as accessed November 3, 2013.{{Subscription or libraries|sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;84}} (p.&amp;nbsp;184 n.&amp;nbsp;84 probably citing Spretnak, Charlene, ed., ''Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power Within the Feminist Movement'' (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1982), p.&amp;nbsp;xiii (Spretnak, Charlene, ''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goettner-Abendroth|2009a|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|pp=258-259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Margot Adler]] wrote, "literally,&amp;nbsp;...

According to Adler, "a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194" /&gt;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hear the word "matriarchy", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html ''Introduction'', in ''Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies''].&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diane LeBow, "matriarchal societies are often described as&amp;nbsp;... egalitarian&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|LeBow|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Feminist anthropology]], an approach to anthropology that tries to reduces male bias in the field}}

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary, Wenda Trevathan, &amp; Janet Levy, ''Anthropology: An Applied Perspective'' (Minneapolis: West Publishing Co., 1992), p.&amp;nbsp;360.{{Verify source|type=title or year|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.&lt;ref name="IroquoisCultureCommentary-p53-p55" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'', in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, Uwe, ''Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. Über Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in frühen Gesellschaften'' (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980).{{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ancient-society.zip Morgan, L., ''Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a "woman-centered" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right'' (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, [[Arthur Evans]], [[Walter Burkert]], and [[James Mellaart]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Ruether, Rosemary Radford, ''Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History''], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the evidence of [[matriarchal religion]] in pre-Hellenic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bachofen&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=NEFQTMugHsT68AbzvImIAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right''].{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Susan Mann]], as of 2000, "few scholars these days find&amp;nbsp;...

The following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's ''Ancient Society'' will explain the use of the terms: "In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}} "Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a ''Mutterrecht'', which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engels|1984}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Das Mutterrecht.

Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php ''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Helen Diner'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn Museum, last updated March 27, 2007)], as accessed March, 2008, &amp; November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by Eisler, [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

"A Golden Age of matriarchy" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by [[Charlene Spretnak]] and "encouraged" by Stone and Eisler,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, at least for the [[Neolithic]] Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', ''Goddess Unmasked'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip G., ''Goddess Unmasked'' (N.Y.: Spence Publishing, 1998 ({{ISBN|0-9653208-9-8}})); [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54600098.html Sheaffer, R., ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1999) (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and is not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]]. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Four (''Visions of Utopia''), in {{harvp|Rohrlich|Baruch|1984|p=207}} ("matriarchal societies, particularly Minoan Crete"), and {{harvp|Rohrlich|1984|p=6}} ("the Minoan matriarchy" &amp; "Minoan Crete").&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cretan civilization" was "matriarchal" before "1500 B.C.," when it was overrun and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Three quotations: {{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Rohrlich, "in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=39}}, quoting Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'',{{Page needed|date=July 2013}} wherein she makes the case that the worship of [[Yahweh]] was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the [[Amorites]] and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]], however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.

However, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in  The Hebrew Goddess that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century B.C.E.  Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a 7th C. Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. She comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=96–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European [[Celts]] and [[Germans]] than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women were running [[Sparta]] while the men were often away fighting. [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]], was asked by a woman in [[Attica]] something along the lines of, "why are Spartan women the only women in the world who could rule men?" Gorgo replied, "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]], several early [[northwestern Europe]]an mythologies from the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] (''e.g.'', [[Macha]] and [[Scáthach]]), the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (''e.g.'', [[Rhiannon]]), and the Germanic (''e.g.'', [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Nerthus]]) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in [[Iron Age|pre-Christian]] European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and [[Catholic]] perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of [[Boudicca]] indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1995, in Kenya, according to Emily Wax, [[Umoja, Kenya|Umoja]], a village only for women from one tribe with about 36 residents, was established under a matriarch.&lt;ref name="PlaceWhereWomenRule-WashPost-p1"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801775.html Wax, Emily, ''A Place Where Women Rule'', in ''The Washington Post'', July 9, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1 (online)], as accessed October 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Men of the same tribe established a village nearby from which to observe the women's village,&lt;ref name="PlaceWhereWomenRule-WashPost-p1" /&gt; the men's leader objecting to the matriarch's questioning the culture&lt;ref name="PlaceWhereWomenRule-WashPost-p2"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801775_2.html Wax, Emily, ''A Place Where Women Rule'', in ''The Washington Post'', July 9, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;2 (online)], as accessed October 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and men suing to close the women's village.&lt;ref name="PlaceWhereWomenRule-WashPost-p2" /&gt; The village was still operational in 2005 when Wax reported on it.&lt;ref name="PlaceWhereWomenRule-WashPost-p1" /&gt;

Spokespersons for various [[indigenous peoples]] at the [[United Nations]] and elsewhere have highlighted the central role of women in their societies, referring to them as matriarchies, or as matriarchal in character.&lt;ref&gt;Tamang, Stella, ''Indigenous Affairs'', vols. 1–2, no. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Six Nations Women's Traditional Council Fire Report to CEDAW'', p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matriarchy may also refer to non-human animal species in which females hold higher status and hierarchical positions, such as among [[lion]]s,&lt;ref name="Schaller37"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref name=Sukumar175&gt;[[#Sukumar|Sukumar]], pp. 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160910"&gt;{{cite news |last=Angier |first=Natalie |title=Beware the Bonds of Female Bonobos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/bonobos-apes-matriarchy.html |date=September 10, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==

=== Amazons ===
A legendary matriarchy related by several writers was [[Amazons|Amazon]] society. According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], "in Amazon societies, women were&amp;nbsp;... mothers and their society's only political and religious leaders",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}} (italics omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only warriors and hunters;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; "queens were elected"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently "any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}} (italics omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Moreover, said Herodotus, "no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. [[Julius Caesar]] spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout [[late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.504.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Church Fathers]] spoke of the Amazons as a real people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert|Ukert, F. A.]], ''Die Amazonen'' (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1849), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
[[Robert Graves]] suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to this myth, in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Celtic myth and society ===
{{main|Ancient Celtic women#Matriarchy}}

According to Adler, "there ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, [[Jean Markale]]'s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=196}} (italics so in original; p.&amp;nbsp;196 n.&amp;nbsp;20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Joan, The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society, in M. Rosaldo &amp; L. Lamphere, Women, Culture, and Society (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1974), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In feminist thought ==
{{Feminism sidebar|theory}}
{{For|groups and communities without men|separatist feminism}}
While ''matriarchy'' has mostly fallen out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it remains current as a concept in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9"&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly, ed., ''Applications of Feminist Legal Theory to Women's Lives: Sex, Violence, Work, and Reproduction'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996 ({{ISBN|1-56639-423-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;9 ("women must organize against patriarchy as a class") but see p.&amp;nbsp;11 ("some radical feminists&amp;nbsp;... opt&amp;nbsp;... for anarchistic, violent methods").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52"&gt;Dale, Jennifer, &amp; Peggy Foster, ''Feminists and State Welfare'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986 ({{ISBN|0-7102-0278-4}})), p.&amp;nbsp;52 ("radical feminist theory&amp;nbsp;.... could, indeed, be said to point in the direction of 'matriarchy{{'"}}) and see pp.&amp;nbsp;52–53 (political separatism).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Stanton]]
In [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] discourse, either [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] or [[Margaret Fuller]] (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;55 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;15}}, citing Stanton, Elizabeth Cady, ''Address'' (Washington Woman's Rights Convention, 1869), in ''History of Woman Suffrage'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;351–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and the discourse was joined in by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=57}}, citing Gage, Matilda Joslyn, ''Woman, Church and State: A Historical Account of the Status of Women through the Christian Ages; with Reminiscences of the Matriarchate'' (Watertown, Mass.: Persephone Press, 1980 (1893)), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Woodhull]], in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year;&lt;ref&gt;''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in {{harvp|Gabriel|1998|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gabriel|1998|loc=''passim'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}}), ''passim'', esp. ch.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], in 1911 and 1914,&lt;ref&gt;The dates are those of two original editions of the same work, both cited herein.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for "a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=61}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described {{"'}}government by women{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=62}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=177}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; both genders being "useful&amp;nbsp;... and should in our governments be alike used",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; because men and women have different qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|pp=153, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural feminism]] includes "matriarchal worship", according to Prof. James Penner.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, James, ''Pinks, Pansies, and Punks: The Rhetoric of Masculinity in American Literary Culture'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-253-22251-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[list of feminist literature|feminist literature]], matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''matriarchy'' sometimes means "the political rule of women",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}} (quoting also Mary Daly ("matriarchy 'was not patriarchy spelled with an "m.{{"'"}}, probably – per {{harvp|Eller|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;12 n.&amp;nbsp;3}} – in Daly, Mary, ''Beyond God the Father'', p.&amp;nbsp;94)).&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt; [[Starhawk]] having written on that distinction&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk, ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics]]'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 15th Anniversary ed. 1997 (original 1982) ({{ISBN|0-8070-1037-5}})), ch.&amp;nbsp;1 (original 1982 ed. cited in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature.{{efn|Adler wrote a matriarchy is "a realm where female things are valued and where power is exerted in non-possessive, non-controlling, and organic ways that are harmonious with nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|1979|p=187}}, as quoted in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that "veneration for the female principle&amp;nbsp;... somewhat lightens an oppressive system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|1990|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist utopia]]s are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, "a feminist utopia would&amp;nbsp;... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willemsen continues, among "type[s] of feminist utopias[,]&amp;nbsp;... [one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons.... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=6}}. See also {{harvp|Poldervaart|1997|p=182}} ("Tineke Willemsen distinghuishes {{Sic}} in her article three large classes of utopias:&amp;nbsp;... 2) feminists who emphasize the difference [between "women and men&amp;nbsp;... in rights and possibilities"]; in these utopias women have a better position than men or feminine qualities are more valued than masculine ones").&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of feminists, generally [[radical feminism|radical]],&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52" /&gt; have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:

Ouma reviewed the book and argued her view that while Dworkin "pays lip service to the egalitarian nature of&amp;nbsp;...

[was "in early second-wave feminism"] the lost object of women's freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zerilli|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Cynthia Eller found widespread acceptance of matriarchal myth during [[second-wave feminism|feminism's second wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kathryn Rountree, the belief in a prepatriarchal "Golden Age" of matriarchy may have been more specifically about a matrifocal society,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rountree|2001|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was believed more in the 1970s than in the 1990s–2000s and was criticized within feminism and within archaeology, anthropology, and theological study as lacking a scholarly basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rountree|2001|pp=5–9 &amp; ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prof. [[Harvey Mansfield|Harvey C. Mansfield]] wrote that "the evidence [is]&amp;nbsp;... of males ruling over all societies at almost all times".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eller said that, other than a few separatist radical lesbian feminists, [[feminist theology|spiritual feminists]] would include "a place for men&amp;nbsp;... in which they can be happy and productive, if not necessarily powerful and in control"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and might have social power as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]] believed that a "matriarchal counterrevolution [replacing "a[n old] patriarchal revolution"]&amp;nbsp;... is the only hope for the survival of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1971|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that "spiritual force",&lt;ref name="1stSex-p339"&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1971|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; "mental and spiritual gifts",&lt;ref name="1stSex-p339" /&gt; and "extrasensory perception"&lt;ref name="1stSex-p339" /&gt;{{Efn|[[Extrasensory perception]] (ESP), perception sensed by the mind but not originating through recognized physical senses}} will be more important and therefore that "woman will&amp;nbsp;... predominate",&lt;ref name="1stSex-p339" /&gt; and that it is "about&amp;nbsp;...

* One organization that was named [[The Feminists]] was interested in matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the largest of the radical feminist women's liberation groups of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Rosemarie Putnam, ''Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction'' (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 2d ed. 1998 ({{ISBN|0-8133-3295-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Two members wanted "the restoration of female rule",&lt;ref name="DaringBad-p184"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|p=184}}, quoting Barbara Mehrhof and Pam Kearon.

* [[Robin Morgan]] wrote of women fighting for and creating a "gynocratic ''world''".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin, ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist'' (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1977 ({{ISBN|0-394-48227-1}})), p.&amp;nbsp;187 (italics so in original).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adler reported, "if feminists have diverse views on the matriarchies of the past, they also are of several minds on the goals for the future. A woman in the coven of Ursa Maior told me, 'right now I am pushing for women's power in any way I can, but I don't know whether my ultimate aim is a society where all human beings are equal, regardless of the bodies they were born into, or whether I would rather see a society where women had institutional authority.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=198}} ("Maior" so in original)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it. According to Karin Schönpflug, "Gerd Brantenberg's ''Egalia's Daughters'' is a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed, with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=108}}, citing [[Gerd Brantenberg]], ''Egalia's Daughters'' (Norwegian original published in 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; "gender inequality is expressed through power inversion"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "all gender roles are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men".&lt;ref name="Karin-p20"&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Egalia'' is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; ''Egalia'' is more a caricature of male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a 'better world.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Karin-p20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Egalia's Daughters'' as fiction: [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_bks&amp;q=Egalia%27s+Daughters&amp;fq=dt%3Abks ''WorldCat'' entry], as accessed August 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eller, "a deep distrust of men's ability to adhere to"&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p290"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; future matriarchal requirements may invoke a need "to retain at least some degree of female hegemony to insure against a return to patriarchal control",&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p290" /&gt; "feminists&amp;nbsp;...

On the other hand, Eller continued, if men can be trusted to accept equality, probably most feminists seeking future matriarchy would accept an equalitarian model.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p291n27"/&gt;

A criticism by Mansfield of choosing who governs according to gender or sex is that the best qualified people should be chosen, regardless of gender or sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|pp=241–242}}, citing Plato, ''Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mansfield considered merit insufficient for office, because a legal right granted by a sovereign (''e.g.'', a king), was more important than merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174 &amp; nn.&amp;nbsp;14, 16–17, &amp; 19}}, citing Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', ch.&amp;nbsp;10, 14–15, &amp; 21, [[Tuck, Richard]], ''Natural Rights Theories'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), ch.&amp;nbsp;6, &amp; Tarcov, Nathan, ''Locke's Education for Liberty'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984), p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity within a proposed community can, according to Becki L. Ross, make it especially challenging to complete forming the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ross|1995|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some advocacy includes diversity, in the views of Dworkin&lt;ref name="Guardian-TakeNoPrisoners"/&gt; and Farley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Farley|1984|p=238}} (respecting Wittig, Monique, ''Les Guérillères'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate with men. "Women must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a struggle for the world's fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or daring sisters, is not an option.... [T]he well-being and liberty of women cannot be separated from democracy's survival."&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present'' (N.Y.: Modern Library (Random House), 1st ed. 2010 ({{ISBN|978-0-679-64314-2}})), p.&amp;nbsp;394.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Herland (novel)|''Herland'']] was feminist utopian fiction by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1911, featuring a community entirely of women except for three men who seek it out,&lt;ref&gt;Bartkowski, Frances, ''Feminist Utopias'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989 ({{ISBN|0-8032-1205-4}})), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; strong women in a matriarchal utopia&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; expected to last for generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=21}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; although Charlotte Perkins Gilman was herself a feminist advocate of society being gender-integrated and of women's freedom.)&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, ''What is "Feminism"?'', in ''The Sunday Herald'', vol.

Other criticisms of superiority are that it is reverse sexism or discriminatory against men, it is opposed by most people including most feminists, women do not want such a position,{{efn|"Women do not run for office as readily as men do, nor do most women, it seems, call on them to run.

[Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, David, ''Preface'' (from extract), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in agreement with Knox was [[Christopher Goodman]], who, according to Lee, "considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used&amp;nbsp;... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred&amp;nbsp;... from any political power",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1990|pp=250, 249}}, citing Goodman, Christopher, ''How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyd'' (N.Y.: reprint, 1931, originally 1558) (chap. on gynecocracy).&lt;/ref&gt; even if, according to Richards, the woman was "virtuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some views included conditionality; while [[John Calvin]] said, according to Healey, "that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Original sin]], in Christianity, a state of sin, or violation of God's will, due to Adam's rebellion in the Garden of Eden}} nonetheless Calvin would not always question a woman's right to inherit rule of a realm or principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Bullinger]], according to Healey, "held that rule by a woman was contrary to God's law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"There were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shone forth in them made it evident that they were raised up by Divine authority". Calvin, letter to William Cecil (on or after January 29, 1559 (probably 1560)), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}} (citing, at ''Preface'', n.&amp;nbsp;1, for letter, ''Zurich Letters'' (2d ser.), p.&amp;nbsp;35) (Calvin reviser, ''Commentaries on Isaiah'' (sometime in 1551–1559) (approximate title)).&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view was much debated in Europe at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|pp=168, 170–171}}, ''e.g.'', citing Aylmer (AElmer&lt;!-- "A" &amp; "E" separate letters --&gt;), John, ''An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiects agaynst the late blowne Blast, concerninge the Gouernment of Wemen wherin be confuted all such reasons as a straunger of late made in that behalfe, with a briefe exhortation to obedience'' (1559).&lt;/ref&gt; the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance&lt;ref name="PromoteWBeareRule-16CJ-p116-n45n46" /&gt; and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity.

* Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years ago, in 390 BC, [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[Assemblywomen|Ecclesiazusae]]'', about women gaining legislative power and governing [[Athens]], Greece, on a limited principle of equality. In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;37}}, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch.&amp;nbsp;9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ruden|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the founder of the [[ANO Institute of Arts &amp; Knowledge]], based in [[Accra]];&lt;ref&gt;Akinyi Ochieng, [http://www.okayafrica.com/nana-oforiatta-ayim-ghana-africa-encyclopedia/ "#Goals: Nana Oforiatta-Ayim Is the Ghanaian Creative Preserving Africa’s Artistic Past"], ''OkayAfrica'', 31 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyaguthii Maina, [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2016/05/04/my-mothers-wardrobe-a-narrative-of-personal-family-and-collective-histories-in-ghana/ "Art and its role in telling personal, family and collective histories"], LSE Blog, 4 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as she has said: "...like a lot of people involved in creative work in Ghana and other parts of Africa, it feels like it’s not just enough for us to produce, but that we have to provide the context and the paradigms for that production".&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Kinsman, [http://www.anotherafrica.net/art-culture/breaking-down-artistic-barriers-in-ghana "Breaking down artistic barriers in Ghana"], ''Another Africa'', 31 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has initiated the pan-African ''Cultural Encyclopedia'', "a large-scale documentation and archive project, dedicated to the re/ordering of knowledge, narratives and representations from and about the African continent"&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturalencyclopaedia.org/about/ "About"], ''Cultural Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginanne Brownell Mitic,[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/arts/international/technology-expands-the-world-for-african-artists.html?_r=0 "Technology Expands the World for African Artists"], ''The New York Times'', 24 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nana Oforiatta Ayim, [http://www.thekaleidoscope.eu/issue-contents/art-in-africawords-by-nana-oforiatta-ayim/index.html "A Cultural Encyclopaedia"], ''Kaleidoscope'', Issue 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Virilli, [http://m.rfi.fr/hebdo/20170512-cultural-encyclopaedia-le-projet-toute-une-vie-nana-oforiatta-ayim "La Cultural Encyclopaedia, le projet de toute une vie de Nana Oforiatta-Ayim"], RFI, 12 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lufuno Ramadwa, [http://www.elle.co.za/nana-ofariatta-ayim-creating-africas-first-art-encyclopedia/ "Nana Oforiatta Ayim Is Creating Africa’s First Art Encyclopedia"], ''Elle South Africa'', 16 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; about which ''[[The New York Times]]'' has written: "The encyclopedia will consist of an open-source internet platform for documenting past, present and future African arts and culture (starting with Ghana) and eventually will be published in 54 volumes, one for each country. An ambitious undertaking, the Cultural Encyclopedia aims to change perceptions of the continent and help alleviate the frustration of African cultural producers concerned that their rich histories have been lost or forgotten over the decades because they lack good archives".&lt;ref&gt;Ginanne Brownell Mitic, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/arts/africa-cultural-encyclopedia.html "How Diverse Is African Art? A 54-Volume Encyclopedia Will Try for an Answer"], ''The New York Times'', 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.marocgazette.com/story-z2952288&lt;/nowiki&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Oforiatta-Ayim has also created a new type of "mobile" museum, using kiosk-sized moveable galleries to showcase artworks and cultural artefacts across the regions of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Snyder, [http://accradotaltradio.com/2016/09/the-kiosk-museum-a-space-of-exploration-inclusive-representation/ "The Kiosk Museum: A Space of Exploration &amp; Inclusive Representation"], Accra [dot] alt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billie Adwoa McTernan, [http://africasacountry.com/2016/01/the-kiosks-in-accra-that-are-reshaping-space-in-the-city/ "Artists in Accra are using kiosks to rethink space in the city"], ''Africa Is a Country'', 21 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice McCool, [https://creators.vice.com/en_au/article/jpvaqx/historian-launches-living-history-hubs-in-ghana "Historian Launches 'Living History Hubs' in Ghana"], Creators, ''Vice'', 9 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Charlotte Jansen writes: "Ayim said she started to reflect on the museum model in  Africa while working at the British Museum. Struck by how differently African objects were encountered in display cabinets in the UK with how they were actively used in festivals back home, she began to think about how material culture could be preserved and presented in a way that was more in keeping with local traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Jansen, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/ghanas-first-travelling-museum-ready-to-hit-the-road-kiosk "Ghana's first travelling museum ready to hit the road"], ''The Guardian'', 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">The '''Netherlands Economic Institute''' ('''NEI''') is a research institute based in [[Rotterdam]].

== History ==

=== 1929–1940 ===
The NEI was established in 1929 by a group of businessmen from Rotterdam. Its initial purpose was to collect economic data and to analyze economic problems. It published its research in its own journal [[Economisch Statistische Berichten|Economische Statistische Berichten]] (ESB). Over the years it added economic consultancy. Before the second World War it remained relatively small with about 20 employees.

=== 1945–1990 ===
NEI was affiliated with the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. One of its directors was professor [[Jan Tinbergen]], who won the first Nobel prize in Economics in 1969. Through his influence NEI became a strong player in development economics. Another director, professor Klaassen, stimulated growth in the field of spatial economics. Later, professor Molle led the NEI to prominence in the field of European integration. Through such expansions and diversifications NEI grew and internationalized significantly. In 1970 it had about 80 employees.

=== 1990–1999 ===
Together with six other European research and consultancy companies NEI founded ERECO, the European Economic Research and Advisory Consortium.

In 1999 NEI was split into a company for research &amp; consultancy and a foundation with the aim to foster economic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ecorys.nl/NEI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917051931/http://english.ecorys.nl/NEI |archivedate=2014-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter NEI merges with Kolpron, a Dutch consulting company in real estate.

== Ecorys ==
In 2000  NEI Kolpron merged with the UK company ECOTEC Research &amp; Consulting, established in 1982. The new organisation was called [[Ecorys]].&lt;ref name="Ecorys"&gt;[http://www.ecorys.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; It has offices in many European companies and also in Turkey, Russia and India.

'''Oral Roberts University''' ('''ORU'''), based in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in the United States, is an interdenominational, Christian, comprehensive [[liberal arts university]] with 4,000 students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=717|title=News - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Itemid=192&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=1634|title=Higher Learning Commission|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1963,  the university is named after its founder, [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Oral Roberts]], and accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].

The school fronts on South Lewis Avenue between East 75th Street and East 81st Street in South Tulsa. Sitting on a {{convert|263|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus, ORU offers over 65 undergraduate degree programs along with a number of masters and doctoral degrees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/facts_about_oru/ |title=Facts about ORU - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma |publisher=Oru.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/12/15/oral.roberts/index.html | work=CNN | title=Evangelist Oral Roberts dead at 91 - CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-20 | date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,192/instid,1634/lang,en/ |title=The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association |publisher=Ncahlc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605194342/http://www.ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,192/instid,1634/lang,en/ |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU is classified as a Master's University by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=207582&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq=%7B%22first_letter%22%3A%22O%22%7D |title=Carnegie Classifications &amp;#124; Institution Profile |publisher=Classifications.carnegiefoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU was also ranked as one of 123 institutions in the 2012 "Best in the West" regional list produced by ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Education ==
[[Image:Christ's Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Christ's Chapel as seen from the gardens surrounding the Prayer Tower.]]

ORU offers [[undergraduate]] programs in [[theology]], [[business]], [[music]], [[communication design|communication arts]], [[modern languages]], [[behavioral sciences]], [[graphics]], [[education]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], [[mathematical science]], [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[English studies|English]], [[history]], [[humanities]], [[government]] and [[nursing]]. The university also has a graduate [[seminary]] and fully accredited graduate programs in Business and Education.

Students in the College of Science and Engineering with a GPA of 3.4 or higher have an 86% medical school acceptance rate and 75% dental school acceptance rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/academics/college_of_science_and_engineering/pre_med.php|title=Pre-Medical - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU students have been accepted into more than 70 medical schools nationally, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Washington University]], and [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Because of the high acceptance rates for medicine, ORU signed an early assurance program with [[Oklahoma State University]] college of Osteopathic Medicine in 2011, allowing high achieving students to receive conditional admission to OSU's medical school program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20110822_oru_osu_medical.php|title=ORU/OSU Center for Health Sciences help grads enter medical school  - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU is also one of the few undergraduate colleges in the southwest to have a human cadaver dissection class. While ORU is considered a Christian University, the College of Science and Engineering does not ignore evolutionary theories to teach [[Creationism]].

ORU is fully accredited by the [[The Higher Learning Commission|Higher Learning Commission]], one of two commission members of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA), which was founded in 1895 as one of six regional institutional accreditors in the United States. A major distinction of ORU is its high number of additional specialized program accreditations, especially for a university of its size. The following is a list of the academic colleges with the recognition of specialized accreditation, along with the name of the accrediting body.

== History ==
[[Image:Praying Hands at the main entrance to the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to campus and The Billy Joe Daugherty Circle]]
The university was founded by [[Oral Roberts]] in 1965 "as a result of the evangelist Oral Roberts' obeying [[God in Christianity|God’s]] mandate to build a university on God’s authority and the [[Holy Spirit]]. God’s commission to Oral Roberts was to 'Raise up your students to hear My voice, to go where My light is dim, where My voice is heard small, and My healing power is not known, even to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Their work will exceed yours, and in this I am well pleased'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orugoldeneagles.com/downloads2/391722.pdf?ATCLID=1335882&amp;SPSID=87170&amp;SPID=10340&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17000|title=ORU Table of Contents (PDF)|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first students enrolled in 1965.

The school was accredited in 1971 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004184134/http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html |date=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp Member Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407101739/http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp |date=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oral Roberts' son [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard]] was named president in 1993. In October 2007 the younger Roberts took a leave of absence, citing a lawsuit filed by former ORU professors; he resigned the following month. Oral Roberts emerged from retirement to take over as interim president of the university, and Tulsa evangelist [[Billy Joe Daugherty]] was named executive regent.

That same month, the school was reportedly "struggling financially" with over $50 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103172655/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 3, 2012 | title=Chairman Says ORU Over $50M in Debt | publisher=The Washington Post | date= October 24, 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU's operating budget for 2007-2008 was more than $82 million. However, in the second quarter of 2009, the university's debt was reduced to $720,000 as of result of a number of simultaneous efforts including a $70 million gift from the [[Mart Green]] family, owners of [[Oklahoma City]]-based [[Hobby Lobby]], and the $25 Million Dollar Matching Campaign, a part of the university's Renewing the Vision effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?site=oru&amp;id=1058 |title=News Stories - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma |publisher=Oru.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2009, it was announced at the end of the university's chapel service that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was debt-free.&lt;ref name="debt-free"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the university's presidential search committee recommended [[Mark Rutland]], President of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God]] in Florida, to officially succeed Richard Roberts, which the Board of Trustees approved. Rutland took office on July 1, 2009 as the third president.&lt;ref name="takesoffice"&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090701_11_0_TULSAO908452 "Oral Roberts University president takes office"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1963–2007 ===
Ground was officially broken for Oral Roberts' university in 1962 in the southern part of the city of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The university received its charter the following year in 1963 from the State of Oklahoma and Oral Roberts University officially opened in 1965 with an enrollment of 300 students and with seven major completed buildings.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"&gt;[http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf "History of Oral Roberts University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821223800/http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf |date=2010-08-21 }} ''[[Dingman.com]]'' (Tulsa, OK.), May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Oral Roberts placed special importance on the [[Prayer Tower]], even though the concept of a building specifically dedicated to prayer located at the center of the campus caused some considerable tension, as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building. However, the tower, designed by architect [[Frank Wallace (architect)|Frank Wallace]], was completed in 1967 at a cost of two million dollars, a further source of contention. After the tower's completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was the keynote speaker.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The first partial graduation took place in 1968 and the first full graduation in 1969.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; In 1971, Roberts announced to the student body that Oral Roberts University had been fully [[accreditation|accredited]] for ten years by the North Central Association, to which the students responded by lifting Roberts off the stage and carrying him around the outdoor assembly amid the cheers of supporters.

During the first decade of the school's existence, enrollment increased at a rapid pace; also during this time, many of the campus' iconic structures were completed, such as the Howard Auditorium, the Graduate Center, the Mabee Center, and Christ's Chapel among others.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The university built the [[CityPlex Towers|City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] hospital, which opened in 1981, and started the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1978,  but severe financial difficulties with both of these institutions led to their closure in 1989.

The [[O. W. Coburn School of Law]] opened in 1979. In 1986 the university "shut down its ailing law school and sent its library to [[Pat Robertson]]'s Bible-based college in Virginia", which subsequently founded the [[Regent University|Regent University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="Scandalspotlight"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/08/scandal_puts_spotlight_on_christian_law_school/?page=full | title=Scandal puts spotlight on Christian law school| publisher=Boston Globe | date= April 8, 2007| first=Charlie | last=Savage  | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden Eagle Broadcasting ====
{{Main|Golden Eagle Broadcasting}}
In January 1996 Golden Eagle Broadcasting, a small digital satellite Christian and family programming television network owned and operated by Oral Roberts University, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20100623_geb_signs_distribution_deal_with_directv.php|title=ORU’s Golden Eagle Broadcasting Signs Distribution Deal with DIRECTV|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming includes the Oral Roberts University Chapel Service, called ''The Gathering,'' ORU sports, and other Christian programs not associated with ORU.

=== 2007 ===

{{wikinews|Oral Roberts University president accused of illegal political donations and financial misappropriation}}
In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in Tulsa County by three former professors who claimed to have been wrongfully terminated. They also alleged university president Richard Roberts misused university assets and illegally ordered the university to participate in Republican candidate Randi Miller's political campaign for Tulsa mayor. This occurred while the tax-exempt university was working lawfully with the [[Republican National Committee]] on out-of-state projects as part of a long-standing, pre-approved curriculum that had been in place for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/daily/2007/10/2007100303n.htm |title=3 Former Professors Sue Oral Roberts U., |accessdate=2007-09-24 |author=  |date=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

{{wikisource|Swails, Brooker, Brooker v. Oral Roberts University|Swails, Brooker, Brooker v. Oral Roberts University}}
Lindsay Roberts, who is referred to in ORU publicity as the university's "first lady," is accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars of university funds on clothes, awarding nonacademic [[scholarship]]s to the children of family friends and sending text messages, mostly sent between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., on university-issued cell phones to people described in the lawsuit as "underage males."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The lawsuit also alleges a longtime maintenance employee was fired for the purpose of giving the job to an underage male friend of Lindsay Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

Richard Roberts told students during his weekly chapel, "This lawsuit ...is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion." Former ORU professor and lawsuit plaintiff Tim Brooker commented, "All over that campus there are signs up that say, 'And God said, build me a university, build it on my authority, and build it on the Holy Spirit.' Unfortunately, ownership has shifted."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501436.html Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts]'', 6 October 2007, retrieved 8 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Church of Christ]] minister [[Carlton Pearson]], a former protege of Oral Roberts, said Richard Roberts was "born into privilege... What others may call extravagance he may not see it as extravagant." According to CNN, Pearson said he was disappointed but not surprised by the allegations, explaining, "These kinds of things are common among family-owned and operated businesses and ministries. They don't cross every T and dot every I."&lt;ref&gt;CNN, ''[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/10/10/oru.suit/?iref=mpstoryview Oral Roberts' son denies he misspent school funds]'', 10 October 2007, retrieved 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Wikipedia's disambiguation page.                           --&gt;
On October 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit adding the university's Board of Regents (Oral and Richard Roberts, along with [[George Pearsons]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Creflo Dollar]], [[Michael Armand Hammer|Michael A. Hammer]], [[John Hagee]], [[Marilyn Hickey]], [[Jerry Savelle]] and [[Charlie Watson|Charles Watson]]) to the suit and alleging three days after the original lawsuit was filed, Roberts fired the university's financial comptroller (who had been employed by ORU for 26 years) and "witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence." The filing also alleged Lindsay Roberts had spent at least nine nights in the ORU guest house with an underage 16-year-old male who also was allowed to live in the Roberts family residence on campus, a situation that made their oldest daughter so uncomfortable, she insisted deadbolt locks be installed on all bedroom doors in the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/orusuit.pdf Online copy of revised Swails lawsuit against ORU, October 12th, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written response to the later allegations Lindsay Roberts said, "I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply. Allegations against me in a lawsuit yesterday are not true. They sicken me to my soul." In a separate written statement the university denied "purposely or improperly" destroying documents.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071013_1__OralR22105 Lindsay Roberts, ORU deny latest claims]'', 13 October 2007, retrieved 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resignation of Richard Roberts ====
{{wikinews|Richard Roberts takes leave of absence from Oral Roberts University}}
On October 17, 2007, Richard Roberts announced a "temporary leave of absence" as president of the university, citing the "toll" the lawsuit and attendant allegations have taken on him and his family. Billy Joe Daugherty became Executive Regent of the Board of Regents and Interim President. Chairman of the Board [[George Pearsons]] noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071018_1_A1_hTheO62814 Roberts takes ORU leave]'', 17 October 2007, retrieved 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, former board of regents member Harry McNevin claimed that during the 1980s, the ORU Board of Regents "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; McNevin also said a country club membership was purchased for Oral Roberts' home. "His idea was if he could get on the golf course with these people, he could get donations for the university," said McNevin. These lavish expenses led McNevin to resign from the board in 1987.

In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the university on November 21, 2007, former ORU senior accountant Trent Huddleston claimed he had been ordered to help Roberts and his wife "cook the books" by misclassifying nearly $123,000 in funds allegedly spent by the university on remodeling the Roberts home.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, November 21, 2007, "[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 Oral Roberts Accountant Sues Over Firing]," Associated Press. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061040/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved by a simple majority a non-binding vote of no confidence in Richard Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;AP, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/education/14oral.html Faculty Opposes Oral Roberts President]'' 13 November 2007, retrieved 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts tendered his letter of resignation to the university's board of regents on November 23, effective immediately. In a prepared email statement released by the university, he said, "I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration and I want to see God's best for all of them." The regents said they would meet the following week to discuss the search for a new president. Executive regent Billy Joe Daugherty continued as interim president (working with chancellor Oral Roberts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071124_1_A1_hMove11578 Roberts resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

"You can't take the sacrifices of God's people and use them any old way," McNevin commented after Roberts' resignation. "It's been 20 years that they've been doing the same things that I became aware of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/23/national/a165630S41.DTL Embattled Oral Roberts President Resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aftermath ====
On November 27, Pearsons said the university planned to separate its finances and leadership from the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, to the apparent approval of many students and faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;AP, Justin Juozapavicius, ''[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20071129/D8T75O201.html Roberts Says God Forced His Resignation]'', 29 November 2007, retrieved 29 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2008 ORU settled with lawsuit plaintiff John Swails who was reinstated to his previous teaching position.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080111_1_A1_hThel03342 ORU reinstates one professor]'', tulsworld.com, 11 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503141315/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also announced a formal search committee for a new president, to be headed by board of regents member and Tulsa resident Glenda Payas.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080110_1_A9_spanc51273 ORU regent to lead committee structuring presidential search]'', tulsworld.com, 10 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–present ===
On January 14, 2008, Oral Roberts University’s board of regents voted unanimously to accept $62 million from the [[Mart Green]] family, founders of [[Hobby Lobby]] and Mardel educational and Christian supply stores. In late October, an ORU spokesman had said ORU was $52.5 million in debt and the school accepted an unconditional $8 million from the Greens in late November. ORU’s board of regents has been replaced with a 23-member board of trustees all initially named by the Greens, with Mart Green as chairman. Although Green said in November, two family members would sit on the board, he will reportedly be the only one. Green said he wanted to be involved in ORU because his family “felt like financial stewardship needed to be shored up.” &lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080115_1__hThea88026 "$62 million for ORU,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', 15 January 2008, retrieved 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campus renovations and layoffs ====

Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, around half went toward eliminating the university's $52 million debt. The remaining $32 million was allocated to, "campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students, marketing and operations," according to the university website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2008, $10 million went toward campus upgrades and deferred maintenance. Many of the dormitories on campus received extensive renovations and most of the campus's other buildings received much needed restoration and upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?intNav=news&amp;id=916|title="Summer Renovations Recap 2008,"|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prayer Tower on the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Prayer Tower]].]]

In January 2009, the University began to implement the employment reduction plans announced in November 2008, laying off 53 employees and cutting about 40 unfilled positions. According to university sources, these layoffs come as the administration and Board of Trustees seeks long-term financial viability for the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090113_330_0_ORUemp571078 "ORU cuts positions, 53 laid off,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2009, it was announced that the Green family would commit an additional $10.4 million to go toward additional campus renovations and upgrades to take place during summer 2009.&lt;ref name="oru.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=991&amp;intNav=|title=Green Family Commits $10 million for Summer Renovations,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the gift, Mart Green, who is chair of ORU's board of trustees, said, "This gift will help to improve the quality of education for students at the new ORU. Our family is excited to continue partnering with ORU financially to ensure this great university continues to provide an excellent, whole-person education." &lt;ref name="oru.edu"/&gt;

==== ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign ====
Following Mart Green's contribution, the university's debt was reduced to $25 million. In February 2008, the Renewing the Vision campaign was initiated in an effort to erase this debt. To free the university from its burgeoning debt, the Board of Trustees announced plans for a $25 million matching campaign,&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Board agreed that it would match dollar-for-dollar all that was donated to the university as part of the Renewing the Vision campaign, up to a maximum of $25 million. ORU Interim President Ralph Fagin stated, "The goal is in one year to get the debt down. It is a pretty audacious goal. It is a faith goal."&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; In addition to eliminating the debt, funds from the Renewing the Vision campaign contributed to the 2008 summer campus renovations as well as scholarships provided by the university.&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; As of June 3, 2009, donations and pledges had reduced the university's original $50 million debt to $720,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webapps.oru.edu/secure/alumniweb/renewingthevision_bf.php|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2009, a $1 million donation was made to the school's Whole Person Scholarship fund by Chairman of the Armand Hammer Foundation and university trustee [[Michael Armand Hammer]], son of Julian Armand Hammer and grandson of the late industrialist [[Armand Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Sept_1/ai_55623393/|title=Oklahoma: Trustee gives $1 million to ORU scholarship fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer's donation will be matched twice and, in the end, will amount to a $4 million donation to the university. The donation will contribute to a new scholarship initiative that seeks to find potential students who are well-rounded and already exhibit the characteristics of a person who is spiritually alive, intellectually alert, physically disciplined, and socially adept. The Whole Person Scholarship provides scholarships that vary from full-tuition down to $2,500 to students who meet the aforementioned criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|title=Whole Person Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312082556/http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|archivedate=12 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidential inauguration of Mark Rutland and debt-free status ====
In January 2009, it was reported that ORU had selected a new president: [[Mark Rutland]], president of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God|Southeastern University]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090114_296_0_OralRo301798 "ORU has candidate for president,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, Rutland confirmed that he had been offered the position, and intended to accept it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090114/NEWS/901140413/1410?Title=Oral_Roberts_Courts_Southeastern_s_Rutland|title=Oral Robert Courts Southeastern's Rutland,|work=TheLedger.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rutland was formally announced as the new president on January 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090129_11_A9_MarkRu182765  "New ORU president named,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He officially took office on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="takesoffice" /&gt;

On September 23, 2009, at the university's twice-per-week chapel service, President Mark Rutland announced that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was now debt-free.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Associated Press]], September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland had indicated in an interview earlier in the year that he had expected the announcement for quite some time and that he could have paid the debt down when he took office in July, "But that's like making a hole in one with nobody on the golf course." He told the Associated Press, "So, we're going to wait until school starts ... and then we'll have a 'ta-dah' moment."

About the erasing of the university's debt, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Mart Green said, "We are extremely thankful to all the donors who stepped up to support ORU. They know the value of this university and they can see the product that ORU produces – excellent, whole-person graduates who are valuable to this community and to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20090923_oru_eliminates_longterm_debt.php|title=Free at Last: Oral Roberts University Eliminates Long-term Debt|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations from alumni contributed heavily to the university becoming free: prior to the 2007 scandal, less than 6 percent of alumni donated to the university; however, as a result of the ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign, donations from alumni rose from $763,000 in 2007 to $2.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"/&gt;

The announcement was made two days before the September 25, 2009, [[inauguration]] ceremony for Rutland held at the [[Mabee Center]] on the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=11197038|title=Dr. Mark Rutland Becomes ORU's Third President|date=25 September 2009|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ceremony of its kind in ORU's history, it was attended and addressed by many dignitaries and guests, among them [[Kathy Taylor]], the mayor of Tulsa, and [[Marilyn Hickey]], former member of the ORU Board of Regents. [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] declared September 25, 2009, "Dr. Mark Rutland Day". At the ceremony, Rutland received a blessing from the founder and chancellor of the university, Oral Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090926_11_A1_MarkRu117184 "ORU inaugurates leader"] [[Tulsa World]], September 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ORU announced that the Green family would make another $10 million gift in 2011, to be used for renovations and technology improvements.  The gift raised the Greens' total donations to $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Sherman, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=19&amp;articleid=20101217_11_0_TheGre168553 "ORU receives another $10 million donation"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', December 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2013, ORU announced that [[Billy Wilson (pastor)|William "Billy" Wilson]], executive director of the International Center for Spiritual Renewal and vice-chair of the ORU board of trustees, had been selected to succeed Rutland as president, effective on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Leclaire, [http://www.charismanews.com/us/38055-oru-names-billy-wilson-as-fourth-president " ORU Names Billy Wilson as Fourth President"], ''[[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma News]]'', January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A day earlier, the ORU student newspaper had briefly posted an erroneous report on its website, mistakenly identifying a different person as the new president. Rutland criticized the report at a student assembly and the newspaper's longtime faculty adviser left the school the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Paluka, [https://archive.is/20130216021409/http://www.fox23.com/mostpopular/story/ORU-professors-exit-causing-stir-on-campus/ChbU85RFZEyMoHxPa_vtsg.cspx "ORU professor's exit causing stir on campus"], [[KOKI-TV]], January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to having a chaplain on every "wing" of each dormitory, there are also Residential Advisers for each floor, who enforce curfew, take attendance at Chapel services, and serve as "go-to persons" for students living on their floors. As well, each floor has an Academic Peer Adviser (APA) who serves to offer or facilitate tutoring services to students who need assistance with their studies; the APA also keeps students informed of academic news and obligations. Every Monday night is a mandatory Hall Meeting at which announcements are made by dorm leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/alumni_and_friends/alumni/media/enewsletters/200901.php "Alumni Newsletter"] ''Oral Roberts University'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All students are required to sign a pledge stating they will live according to the university's [[honor code]]. Prohibited activities include [[lie|lying]], [[Profanity|cursing]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]], and a range of [[Human sexuality|sexual acts]] including [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior and sex outside marriage.&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"&gt;[https://webapps.oru.edu/slle/code-of-honor-pledge.pdf "Honor Pledge"] ''Oral Roberts University'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2003, the student [[Social aspects of clothing|dress code]] was relaxed for the first time in 40 years and described as [[business casual]].

In 2006, campus-wide dress code rules were eased further, allowing students to wear jeans to class and dress more casually in non-academic settings. Since 2009, men are allowed to have neatly trimmed facial hair. Restrictions on men concerning hair length were relaxed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.oru.edu/flash_flipbooks/student_handbook/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru%20alumni/right74.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902221931/http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru%20alumni/right74.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-02 |title=Ties and Skirts: Addressing the Issue |accessdate=2006-06-29 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=ORU:Alumni Foundation |pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has weekly chapel services in Christ's Chapel, which are recorded and broadcast live through the university's television station and also via satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golden-eagle-tv.com/shows/chapel.html "Enter In (formerly ORU Chapel"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904051115/http://www.golden-eagle-tv.com/shows/chapel.html |date=September 4, 2009 }} ''Golden Eagles Broadcasting'', September 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The television broadcast, called "ORU Alive," is directed from the television studios in the [[Mabee Center]] while the cameras and sound equipment are manned by students.

A typical chapel service features [[contemporary worship]], a missions offering, special music, and a [[sermon]], typically from the President of the University, Dr. [[Billy Wilson (academic)|William Wilson]], as well as special guests, including some of the world's biggest and most well-known pastors, evangelists, and spiritual leaders.

=== Futuristic architecture ===
[[Image:Learning Resource Center - Graduate Center on the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|right|Main campus building, the Learning Resource and Graduate centers]]
The campus was built beginning in 1963 with a noted [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] look and architecture. Architects Stanfield, Imel &amp; Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan but most of the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm Tulsa Historical Society Art Deco Tours 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182647/http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as "sculptures", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was "whittling since I was a kid".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Evatt, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=32&amp;articleid=20100929_32_E1_CUTLIN175896 "ORU architect's home to be auctioned"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa's [[art deco]] architectural heritage&lt;ref&gt;For more detail regarding Tulsa's art deco heritage, see [[List of Art Deco buildings in Tulsa, Oklahoma]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|title=''Modern Tulsa'' blog archive for ORU|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201164639/http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Bruce Goff]]'s individualistic style and creative use of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 "A Century of Structures,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010060353/http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 |date=2007-10-10 }} from ''Oklahoma Magazine'' (retrieved 18 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the campus was described as "a perfect representation of the popular modernistic architecture of the time... the set of ''[[The Jetsons]]''" but also "shabby" and "dated, like [[Walt Disney|Disney's]] [[Tomorrowland]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, Associated Press, ''[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts U.]'', 5 October 2007 retrieved 7 October 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040106/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending |agency=Associated Press |date=November 8, 2007 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111161744/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle's Case Studies, ''[http://www.carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 Oral Roberts University Fights Back with Help from Carlisle SynTec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195328/http://carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 |date=2007-10-12 }}'' 19 March 2007, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance of the many unique but aging buildings, structures and architectural details on campus was cited as a growing problem for the university.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Tulsa, ''[http://www.losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html Oral Roberts University in Decay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184010/http://losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html# |date=2007-10-12 }}', 10 February 2006, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, $10 million was set aside from [[Mart Green|Green]] family donations for long deferred maintenance on many campus buildings, along with the prayer tower.

The main academic building is the John D.

Bi-weekly university chapel services are held in Christ's Chapel, a 3,500 seat building constructed in drape-like fashion as an echo of Oral Roberts' early tent [[Revivalism|revivals]]. The [[Googie]] style [[Prayer Tower]] at the center of campus was intended to resemble "an abstract [[Christian cross|cross]] and [[Crown of Thorns]]" and also houses a [[visitor center]]. The [[Mabee Center]] is an 11,000 seat arena on the southwestern edge of campus and is used for basketball games, concerts, church services and satellite television productions. Timko-Barton Hall houses musical and theatrical performance halls as well as classrooms devoted to the university's programs in the performing arts. The building's performance halls are often the scene of concerts and recitals by performing arts students.

The [[Kenneth H. Cooper]] Aerobics Center houses basketball courts, an elevated running track, a free-weights and exercise room, a swimming pool and classrooms for students who are enrolled in [[Health Fitness|health fitness]] courses (a requirement for all students). J.L. Johnson Stadium is a 2,200 seat baseball stadium located on the north of the campus.

The [[Armand Hammer]] Alumni-Student Center was designed by KSQ Architects, PC, and constructed and completed in 2013. It is the first building to be built on the ORU campus in decades. It totes the largest TV in Oklahoma, a "living room" for students, a gaming center equipped with [[Wii]]'s and [[Xbox]]'s, pool tables, ping pong, and more. The building is a modern design fitting for the campus. Students also enjoy addition restaurants and a coffee shop. The Armand Hammer Student-Alumni Center also houses student government offices as well as board rooms for special meetings. No classes meet in this building; it is strictly for the use and enjoyment of the student body.

The Hamill Student Center is located between Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts Halls and houses restaurants on its lower level. Zoppelt Auditorium is located on the ground level and is often used as a lecture hall for classes, forums and special events. Campus Security and the "Fireside Room" are also on ground level with the university cafeteria (called "Saga" by students) on the upper level.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"&gt;Student Handbook ''[http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf Student Handbook Fall 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165525/http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}'' retrieved 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Housing ====
There are eight dormitories on campus.

* '''Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building built in 1965 that can house up to 600 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "Claudius" by students, the building is named after Oral Roberts' mother.
* '''Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building also built in 1967 that can house up to 600 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "EMR" by campus residents, this dormitory is similar to Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall but has some differences, notably walls made of concrete blocks rather than sheetrock, two elevators instead of one and laundry facilities located in the basement instead of every floor. According to the university, these two tri-winged buildings are meant to reflect the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall &amp; Claudius and Priscilla Roberts Hall] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113618/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Towers Dormitories.jpg|thumb|right|The four "Towers" residence halls, Michael Cardone, Wesley Leuhring, Susie Vinson and Frances Cardone.]]
* '''Frances Cardone Hall''' (originally named Ethel Hughes Hall) is a twelve-story building for housing up to 372 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; This is one of the four "Towers" dormitories, which are meant to represent the [[Star of David]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php Towers] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084514/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is called "Frances" by university students.
* '''Michael Cardone, Sr. Hall''' (originally named Edward Hughes Hall) is the twin dormitory to Frances and houses up to 372 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; It is linked to the three other Towers dormitories by a central hallway and the main lobby area, called the "Fishbowl" for its glass exterior walls.
* '''Susie Vinson Hall''' is one of two shorter "Towers" housing 244 women on eight stories and known as "Susie."&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;
* '''Wesley Leuhring Hall''', called "Wesley" by students, is the twin dormitory of "Susie" and is much alike in both capacity and design.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; In the summer of 2017, Wesley was converted into a women's dorm and was to be called "Susie South."
* '''Gabrielle Christian Salem Hall''' is a three-story split-level dormitory located west of Timko-Barton Hall and called "Gabby" by the students. It can house up to 240 women and has secured doors that open using university issued cards. There are in-room bathroom facilities on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;

The university has strict guidelines concerning student access to the upper floors of residence halls by members of the opposite sex, which is limited to designated occasions called "Open Dorms."

==== CityPlex Towers ====
In 1981, the [[City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] opened. The buildings are south of the ORU campus, and were originally built as a 60-story clinic, a 30-story hospital, and a 20-story research center. The original tenants left in 1989 because of [[Finance|financial]] problems and a lack of demand for medical services. As of 2007, some floors (in the 20-story building) have never been leased. The facility is now mostly leased out as [[commerce|commercial]] [[office]] space under the name [[CityPlex Towers]]. A 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18.2 m), 30 [[ton]] bronze sculpture ''Praying Hands'', by sculptor Leonard McMurray (cast in [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Mexico]] in 1980) and originally in front of the towers, was moved to the ORU campus entrance in the summer of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&amp;articleid=240903&amp;archive=yes Moving hands]'' retrieved 09 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Oral Roberts Golden Eagles}}
Oral Roberts University is a member of [[The Summit League]] after leaving its former conference home, [[Southland Conference]], in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url =http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=440&amp;articleid=20111025_440_0_OralRo880305|title=Oral Roberts joins Southland Conference|author=Mike Brown|date=October 25, 2011 | accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its athletic programs include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis along with track and field for men and women. There is also a baseball program for men and volleyball for women.

ORU's early sports team nicknames were the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] for men and the Lady Titans for women, adopted in 1965 by a vote of the student body. On April 30, 1993, all teams for both men and women became known as the [[Oral Roberts Golden Eagles|Golden Eagle]]s. ORU's current [[mascot]] is "Eli" the [[golden eagle]], who hatched out of his [[papier-mâché]] egg on November 17, 1993 before the start of an exhibition basketball game as the official symbol of a new era in ORU athletics. The mascot's name is an [[acronym]] for education, lifeskills and integrity.

The men's basketball team coached by [[Scott Sutton]] went to three straight [[NCAA]] tournaments from 2006 to 2008.{{When|date=March 2012}} ORU's women's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA tournaments in the past eight seasons.

The ORU baseball team has played in 21 NCAA regional tournaments. ORU advanced to the College World Series in 1978. In 2006, ORU advanced to the NCAA Super Regional against Clemson.  ORU baseball once won 12 consecutive conference championships and played in 12 consecutive NCAA regional tournaments (1998 to 2009).&lt;ref name="thesummitleague.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |title=ORU Captures Baseball Championship Title With 6-2 Win Over SDSU - theSummitLeague.org—Official Web Site of The Summit League |publisher=Thesummitleague.org |date=2009-05-24 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723023808/http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Doctrine ===
ORU has been criticized for endorsing [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]] doctrines of [[faith]]. Critics cite Oral Roberts' connection with [[Word of Faith]] doctrine and how they believe this has been used for self-promotion and justification of [[economic materialism]]. Oral Roberts helped pioneer the concept of "[[Seed Faith]]", which associated acts of God with the results of an individual's previous investment into God's will, like a plant growing from the investment of a seed. Scriptural citations for the doctrine include Luke 6:38  "Give, and it shall be given unto you, full measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom; for what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again". Critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} claim this is equivalent to believing [[miracle]]s can be bought and makes God into a manipulable party. This so-called "Seed Faith" is thought of widely  as a scam to trick socially and intellectually weak believers into sending funds to preachers who adhere to this principle.

Some of the earliest criticisms of the Word of Faith movement came from ORU faculty members including Professor [[Charles Farah]] and one of his students, Daniel Ray McConnell. McConnell submitted a PhD thesis to the university detailing his assertion that the teachings of the movement are heretical. This was later published as ''A Different Gospel'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;D.R. McConnell, ''A Different Gospel'', updated edition, (Hendrickson, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramadan disruption===
In February 1997, on the 28th day of [[Ramadan]], several students from Oral Roberts University reportedly disrupted services at a mosque in the city of [[Tulsa]] near the [[University of Tulsa]]. The students mistakenly thought it was the 27th night of Ramadan, which is the holiest night of the Muslim calendar. Mujeeb Cheema, the chairman of the Islamic Society of Tulsa at that time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "Some 20 Oral Roberts students put their hands on the exterior doors and walls of the mosque and prayed for the conversion of the Muslims." The students left after police had been summoned to the scene.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/12/us/oral-roberts-students-anger-muslims.html|title=Oral Roberts Students Anger Muslims|date=12 February 1997|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the event, the society received a written apology from the Reverend Bill Shuler, who was the director of religious services on the ORU campus. A university spokesman indicated that the students would not be disciplined and that officials from the university were discussing with the students their accounts of the events, which differed from what was reported by the Muslims attending the religious services. Another Oral Roberts official, Jesse Pisors, further stated that despite the fact that students were praying for the conversion of Muslims, "their purpose specifically was not to proselytize or to intimidate."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== LGBT issues ===
Citing alleged discrimination against [[LGBT]] students at ORU, in 2006 [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]] placed the university on its 2006 [[Equality Ride]] route and the rally took place on March 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/422259/activists_plan_to_visit_2_private_colleges/index.html "Activists Plan to Visit 2 Private Colleges"] redOrbit, September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; University administration refused the activists the right to enter the campus and several were arrested after they entered the campus in spite of the university administration's decision.  Soulforce members object to the university's honor code pledge's ban on homosexual activity (i.e. homosexual intercourse). All students are required to sign and abide by the honor code which places the same restriction on all sexual activity performed outside of "traditional marriage of one man and one woman."&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"/&gt;

While homosexual activity is against the school's honor code, many LGBTQ students have still attended the school due to family or personal choice. Over time, ORU alumni have made groups such as ORU-OUT and gay-straight alliances to allow LGBTQ students and alumni to have social support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oruout.com/|title=oruout — All for One and Love for All|work=oruout|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102162423/http://www.oruout.com/|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|title=ORU Out|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215221549/http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni of the University have also dedicated Facebook groups and petitions to stand against harsh anti-gay laws in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/ORU-Alumni-Against-Ugandas-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill/168570909834655?sk=info|title=ORU Alumni Against Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Bill - About - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">[[Image:Our Whole Lives.jpg|thumb|The Our Whole Lives logo.]]'''Our Whole Lives''', or '''OWL''', is a series of six comprehensive [[Sexual education|sexuality curricula]] for children, [[teenagers]], young adults and [[adults]] published by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[United Church of Christ]] [[Justice and Witness Ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Universalist Association Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.uua.org/re/owl). Retrieved on 2007 May 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Church of Christ Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality_education/our-whole-lives.html). Retrieved on 2007 November 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication was the result of seven years of collaborative effort by the two faiths to prepare material which addresses sexuality throughout the lifespan in [[age appropriate]] ways.

The Our Whole Lives program operates under the idea that well informed [[youth]] and young adults make better, healthier decisions about [[human sexuality|sexuality]] than those without complete information. OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about [[heterosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[homosexual]], and [[transgender]] [[sexual health]]. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality.

==Program structure==
There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year-olds) and one for adults.

Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the "Sexuality and Our Faith" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA]] and [[Canadian Unitarian Council|CUC]] communities and another one for the [[United Church of Christ|UCC]] community. Without "Sexuality and Our Faith," the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions.

==Program values==
Our Whole Lives is built upon four core values:
# Self Worth
# Sexual Health
# Responsibility
# Justice and Inclusivity.

Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships.  Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values.

==Program leaders==
Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations.  Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers.  Training is intensive and focused on building the facilitation skills demanded by Our Whole Lives. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session, giving future leaders hands-on experience.  At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations.  

Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two – one male and one female – for each class.  The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their trainers.  For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups.  Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency.

In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7–9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial [[About Your Sexuality]], which went out of print in the 1990s.

Police are often a significant source of abuse for sex workers, particularly poor sex workers. Greater exposure to the police often means more experience of police abuse; one study found that sex workers with greater police oversight were more likely to be obliged to provide free sexual services to the police than sex workers with less police oversight.&lt;ref name="levittChicago"/&gt; For some groups of sex workers in some locations in the U.S., police are the primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="torrezChicago"/&gt; Police may be the most abusive towards sex workers who have experienced the most victimization from other sources; a study found that sex workers who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work were more likely to suffer police abuse than sex workers who chose to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="burnsAlaska"/&gt; 

Police abuse can have long lasting consequences; when police falsely arrest someone for prostitution, the resulting criminal record may make it difficult for that person to find jobs or get housing. Incarceration and court attendance for false charges can disrupt efforts to pursue careers outside of sex work, as when a student misses classes.&lt;ref name="viceNYC"/&gt; Seemingly innocuous actions can affect safety; when officers tell sex workers to "move along", the workers often end up in areas where they feel less safe.&lt;ref name="arringtonDC"/&gt; When police target an HIV+ person for repeated arrests, they may prevent the person from going to scheduled appointments with health care providers, and jail disrupts medication routines.&lt;ref name="hrwNewOrleans"/&gt; And sometimes abuse creates physical harm that is immediate and intentional, as when police officers physically assault a sex worker without evidence of crime and without making an arrest.&lt;ref name="thukral0NYC"/&gt;

This article lists government investigations, research reports, and news articles that describe police abuse of sex workers in the United States, and gives a description of the relevant information from each document.

Excerpt from a sex worker story:

{{ quote
| text= One of [the police officers] put his hand up my skirt and ripped my underwear off. He slammed me down on the car, he injured me. Um, left me with some broken fingertips, broken toes, fractured cheekbone... I was bleeding, I had my skirt ripped... people were just mortified because they'd seen a teenage girl get assaulted by a police officer...
| author= study respondent
}}

The general trend of the study statistics was that the sex workers who had suffered the worst victimization in the past were the ones most likely to be abused by the police.

The following tables compare the experiences of three groups: all the respondents in the study, the respondents where were manipulated or coerced into sex work, and the respondents who were forced into sex work.

Respondents who were manipulated or coerced into sex work were more likely to attempt to report a crime, but the police were less likely to take their report and more likely to threaten or arrest them.

The DOJ found "indications that the BCPD disregards reports of sexual assault by people involved in the sex trade..." Investigators heard from the community that officers were coercing sexual favors from sex workers. Internal records indicated that this was true and the officers weren't being punished. Prior to the DOJ investigation, an internal investigation by the BCPD found an officer receiving sex from a sex worker in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. The case was closed without any attempt to gather more evidence, interview the police officer, or prosecute the officer. Cases were opened for the same officer a second and third time for the same offense. The witness for the third case died before she could be interviewed, and only then did the BCPD review the officer's phone records and discover that he had sent sexually explicit messages to a number of female sex workers. The officer was allowed to retire. The DOJ found similar cases involving other officers.

The primary form of police abuse was coercive sex, through the threat of arrest. In some cases the officer received the sexual service and arrested the sex worker anyway.

This is a working paper that was never published, as far as I know. However, the PDF file is freely available and some of the results are discussed in Levitt and Dubner's book ''SuperFreakonomics''. 

The study compared two neighborhoods, one where none of the women had pimps, and one where all the women had pimps. The women without pimps were more likely to be arrested and three percent of all sexual services were provided to police officers free of charge. The women with pimps were less likely to be arrested and didn't provide free sexual services. Sex workers were more likely to have sex with a police officer than be arrested by one.

Twenty four percent of street-based sex workers had been raped by a police officer. Twenty percent had experienced other sexual assault from police officers. Women doing survival sex and women in drug houses experienced a lot of violence from police. Thirty percent of exotic dancers who had been raped were raped by police, and twenty percent of the sexual violence they experienced was committed by police. Twenty five percent of escorts had been robbed by a police officer. Eighteen percent of escorts had been forced to masturbate a police officer.

This is a survey of bad encounters experienced by young people in the sex trade and street economy. Bad encounters were divided into three categories: violence, harassment, and refusal to help. The largest source of both harassment and violence was the category of police, which included the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and security guards in schools. Sexual violence by police made up 11% of all bad encounters.

One of the main findings was that institutional violence made individual violence worse. When girls suffered harm and sought help, the system they were seeking help from often did more harm. An example was a girl being arrested when she tried to file a report for rape. Or this:

{{ quote
| text= I went to the hospital for a rape kit and when I got there the police officer accused me and my advocate of not cooperating. The officer started yelling at us both and said I was going to jail for lying. The officer never filed a report but called Child Services and I got sent to a group home but nothing ever happened with the rape.
}}

Another finding was that bad encounters increase when institutions work together. In over 40% of bad encounters with police, another institution was involved. Young people run away from hospitals, foster care, and other service systems because they are physically, emotionally, or sexually harmed or neglected. When police forcibly return someone to one of these settings, they place the young person back in the harmful situation they were escaping from.

An example of police working with another institution to scare a person away from getting help:

{{ quote
| text= I got hit on the head by someone on the train. The police took me to the hospital. The hospital tried to put me in the psych ward because I was transgender. They said I couldn't leave the hospital even though I didn't want to stay. They called the policeman back to try to force me to stay because they said I was a minor. I went to the bathroom then hid and left before they got there.
}}

The result was that the person never got the medical help they needed because of gender discrimination and fear of being put in a psych ward.

The researchers found that police frequently sexually assaulted youth in the sex trade. The following story, sex followed by arrest, was repeated many times:

{{ quote
| text= I was solicited by a police officer who said that if I had sex with him he wouldn't arrest me. So I did. Then afterwards he cuffed me and pressed charges anyway.
}}

Sometimes it was worse.

{{ quote
| text= I was going to meet a new john, it turned out to be a sting set up by the cops. He got violent with me, handcuffed me and then raped me. He cleaned me up for the police station and I got sentenced to four months in jail for prostitution.
}}

Young trans women profiled as prostitutes was another common story.

{{ quote
| text= I keep being arrested in Rogers Park just for standing still. They keep taking me in for prostitution even though I'm not doing anything at all. It's the same white cop doing it too.
}}

From the point of view of the young people in the study, the transition to an anti-trafficking regime hasn't made much difference.

{{ quote
| text= When being held in protective custody [because they said I was a victim of human trafficking] they started withholding my sheets, then towels, then pillows, then food because they said I wasn't telling them everything I could&amp;mdash;when in fact I was.
}}

And this:

{{ quote
| text= I was receiving a rape kit after a trafficking experience and the detective was questioning me and my advocate. The officer physically wouldn't let me out of the room. She threatened to send me and my advocate to jail unless we reported what happened [but I didn't want to tell her about my experience.] The officer got loud and in our faces, swore at us and made a big scene. I got between the officer and my advocate to get her out of my advocate's face. As soon as I could I ran out the door but the officer grabbed my arm so I pushed away and hid until I could get out of the hospital.

The sample consists of one hundred sixty nine respondents between the ages of thirteen and twenty four.

One respondent was given the choice between arrest and doing something "disgusting". She wouldn't tell the researcher what she was asked to do, but she told the other police officers at the station about it and they laughed at her.

A respondent was asked by an officer to show her breasts in order to avoid arrest. Another respondent had charges dropped because of police misconduct; the officer who arrested her had her perform oral sex on him.

Survey respondents said that police profiled transgender people as sex workers and subjected them to verbal abuse and sexual misconduct, including demands for sex in exchange for leniency. Police were arresting people for solicitation if they carried condoms. Even trans sex workers who weren't arrested for carrying condoms saw it happen to others and where afraid to carry condoms. Some police officers used possession of condoms to coerce trans sex workers into providing free sexual services. 

People who tested positive for HIV while in jail were visited by an HIV task force that scheduled appointments at a clinic. However, many people were rearrested before their scheduled appointment. One woman was arrested ten times in three years, preventing her from going to any scheduled appointments to receive care for her HIV infection during that period. Jail interrupts taking medication on a regular basis.

Transgender youth reported being picked up for prostitution or loitering for prostitution when they weren't working. One eighteen year old transgender youth reported being extorted for sex by police officers eight times. Once arrested, transgender youth were more likely to be sexually exploited by jail staff than cisgender youth were. 

Two quotes from cisgender respondents:

{{ quote
| text= The DT who arrested me gave me his number after I went through booking. Then after my court appearance, he pulled me into a corner and was like tonguing me down.
| author= eighteen year old female
}}
{{ quote
| text= Police raped me a couple of times in Queens. The last time that happened was a couple of months ago. But you don't tell anybody. You just deal wit it.

}}

A young woman described going to the police to help another girl with an abusive pimp, only to be arrested.

This study covered NYC as well as a few upstate counties. Most of the data came from NYC.

Police officers propositioned underage youth and made lewd comments. Most female youth in the study reported trading sex to avoid arrest. Pimps were not arrested or received less jail time than the youth that worked with them, even when one of the youths was identified as fourteen years old.

Abuse varied by location and police officer. Women were more likely to be arrested or ticketed in Brooklyn. Interactions with police in the Bronx were more likely to involve off-duty officers. However, a white woman in the Bronx reported that the police targeted her because she was white, telling her that she was making white people look bad. In Bushwick police harassment was so bad that a service organization was forced to change its location to protect its outreach staff. Latinas reported the worst harassment, including name-calling, stalking, and throwing food. A couple of women based in Bushwick reported daily harassment that caused them to avoid leaving their homes.

Examples of police language: 

{{ quote
| text= bitch

ho

slut

you're not dead yet?

we gotta go clean up the trash

why should we help you?
}}

A transwoman said she was subjected to constant harassment, and the officers who harassed her were the ones who wanted "oral sex on the side."

Thirty percent of the respondents reported threats of violence from the police, and twenty seven percent reported experiencing violence. One respondent said "I've seen cops get out of a car and beat a girl, and then get back in the car and leave." Another said that her greatest fear during arrest was "not coming home at all." The white woman from the Bronx said "... they throw you on the floor and they step on you..."

Another respondent reported seeing officers injure a women in the pelvic area to prevent her from working.
{{ quote
| text= ... it was like he was squeezing a handball or something, but really really hard... it was two guys in a car and they drove up on the sidewalk. He pushed her against the wall and then he pushed her against the wall after he finished that and then he said "now get off the street"...
| author= respondent
}}

One respondent reported that an officer followed her for thirty blocks in his civilian car. Another reported that an officer followed her and warned off clients with his bullhorn. Another reported that an officer felt her breasts and made her expose them as cars were driving by while he wrote a ticket. Some statements made by police officers to sex workers:

{{ quote
|text= It's hot tonight, it's a sweep, you should get out of here, now what can you do for me?

You wanna get arrested or you wanna give up some head?

I gave you two cigarettes, you want anything else, you know what you can do for me.

Can I rub against you for $10? [said during arrest]

Either you give me a blow job or I'm going to lock you up.
| author= various police officers, quoted by study respondents
}}

Several respondents reported having money stolen while being searched or arrested.

A sampling of the false arrest stories:

*A respondent reported getting a summons while waiting to have her hair done. 

*A transwomen who was first arrested for prostitution at age fifteen reported that "I got arrested for prostitution long before I knew what prostitution was." She also said "... they just snatch you coming out of the subway, just because you're a tranny." 

*A ciswoman was approached in a park by an officer who checked and discovered that she had no outstanding warrants. He walked away and another officer approached her and arrested her. She was held for five hours before being released. By way of explanation, a police officer said "See this sheet? All these warrants aren't yours.[sic]"

*Another woman reported being stopped coming out of a grocery store. The police spilled her groceries on the ground and arrested her for prostitution.

This is an article from the Vice website. It opens with an ex-sex worker's story of false arrest; when she turned down an undercover officer's offer of money for sex, the police arrested her anyway. Because of being locked up, she missed a day of classes she needed to start a career outside of sex work. She informed the reporter that it's common for new officers to arrest women walking to the park where she was arrested, even though they're not working. One woman was arrested because the police said she was waving while wearing a low cut top and a miniskirt. Her attorney took pictures of her at arraignment wearing a jacket and pants and got the charges dropped. Another woman was arrested while wearing a peacoat and jeans that "outlined her legs."

A transwoman named Ryhannah Combs was picked up on prostitution charges while running errands. She was carrying no condoms but the arresting officer said she was carrying nine. Instead of being put in a cell, she was chained to a wall. The city settled when she sued.

A staff attorney at the Trafficking Victims Advocacy Project said that the police frequently verbally abused her clients when arresting them, and on multiple occasions have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.

Women who are addicted and becoming dope sick are targeted for sex. This was described as "a deal with the Devil," because the police officer will keep coming back for information, sex, or an easy arrest.

Study data was drawn from 1,400 client records from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project. The researchers also interviewed twenty EIP clients who had had prostitution-related offenses cleared from their record.

Some of the study respondents had positive or neutral experiences with the police, but most of them had overwhelmingly negative experiences: verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and profiling.

Verbal abuse included slurs, derogatory comments, and refusal to use the person's native language, even when able to do so. Police used humiliation to extract cooperation. One trans woman described particularly intense humiliation, recurring with each arrest.

Some respondents had been propositioned by the police or had police as clients. One respondent described an officer who started off as a client. After their last session he came back the next day in his uniform and arrested her.

Some respondents reported repeated prostitution arrests by the same officer, even when the women weren't working. One woman was arrested while going to the store in pajamas and bedroom slippers. She described another arrest that occurred while she was meeting a cousin for dinner. She was charged even though the cousin came to the police station and told the police what they had been doing. One respondent described a police officer stating that he would lock her up if he saw her on the street.

Some respondents who were trafficked or victims of violence sought help from the police, only to be ridiculed or ignored.

The study sample was fifty two indoor sex workers.

63% of the respondents had police-initiated contact with the police, but 63% of those said the contact was rare. Only one person, a trans woman, had police-initiated contact as often as a couple of times a week. The police in her neighborhood knew her because she had previously worked outdoors. They harassed her, honking at her as she was walking down the street, telling her to go home or they would arrest her, and calling her "Mr." or "homeboy". Another trans woman said the police harassed her because she was transgender.

Several respondents said that during arrests, police took their pictures with personal cameras. They believed the pictures were for the officers' personal use. 12% of respondents had been falsely arrested at least once.

29% of respondents had been taken into custody but released without arrest. The researchers believe the lack of police follow up indicates that there was no basis for taking the people into custody.

14% of respondents had experienced police violence and felt they had no recourse. One woman said she was beaten twice, both times because she refused to give police officers free oral sex. The first time, after she bit the officer's penis, he beat her until she passed out. Another woman was having problems with a particularly violent officer:

{{ quote
| text= One likes to beat me now and then, or he wants me to suck his dick. I mean, it's crazy. He hits me with his gun and gives me these marks on my legs and my back. I don't know what to do...

I can't call the other cops. I did that once and they asked this guy to stop beating me. But he got so mad that he came around and beat me up even worse. So I really have to get out of here. Now he wants me to give him 25% of what I make...

I had to go to the hospital because I got beat so bad.
| author= respondent
}}

Four respondents said that police had stolen money. One said that police steal from her about once a year. Two respondents had $4,000 and a laptop stolen from them during an arrest.

16% of respondents said they had been in sexual situations with the police. Some had sex with the police for protection or because the officers were customers, but others were picked up by the police and given the choice between sex and arrest.

Some of the Latinos reported regular police harassment.

The study sample was two hundred eighty three young people selected through RDS.

Most of the respondents had been profiled, but only a small number were profiled for sex work. White and black youth were more likely to be profiled than Latinx. A black Dominican trans woman described moving into Manhattan and talking a walk around her new neighborhood. A police officer stopped her and told her she had better not be "on a stroll." At the time, she didn't know what a stroll was.

For interactions initiated by the police, 38.5% of survey respondents reported being humiliated or verbally abused by police during relatively minor interactions such as checking ID. One respondent said the officer called her a whore, prostitute, and trick. During 8.6% of these interactions, officers confiscated or destroyed safe sex supplies, including condoms. 17.3% of respondents said that police-initiated interactions involved the officer asking for sexual services, or demanding sexual services to avoid arrest. 9.1% of respondents reported being assaulted by police officers. 3 respondents reported strip searches.

Seventy eight respondents were profiled as sex workers and ordered to "move along." The most common result of this was that they ended up in an area where they felt less safe.

75% of trans people and 82.4% of Latinos said they were treated worse than others when they were in lock up.

When the survey respondents initiated contact with the police, usually to report a crime, in a number of cases the police tried to have sex with them. This seemed to be particularly true of trans Latinas.

This is an overview of the literature available at the time of publication on law enforcement abuse of various groups of women. There's a short discussion of sex workers at the end.

Police abuse of sex workers includes verbal insults, coerced sex, brutal beatings, and rape. When police know that a woman is a sex worker, they may harass her when she is not working. 

The most common abuses are verbal abuse and threats to arrest sex workers if the police don't receive sexual services. Police often assume that sex workers don't care who they will have sex with and will do anything to avoid arrest. But experienced street-based sex workers often refuse to provide free services. They are resigned to frequent arrests, including arrests for questionable charges. What they want to avoid are fear and indignity forced on them by bad officers.

One observer describes Chicago police picking up sex workers when the workers are on their way to and from work, and asking for sexual services. New York City police have threatened to shut down sex parlors if they didn't get free sexual services. Women picked up in raids have been taken away in their underwear and had their possessions confiscated.

Trans female sex workers face these and other more complex forms of abuse. If their official documentation doesn't match their gender presentation, they may face verbal abuse and cruel jokes centered around the difference. They may be subjected to unnecessary and illegal strip searches, ostensibly to determine their gender.

Police use sex work to profile people, stop them on the street, intimidate and question them, check for warrants, and often arrest them.

The discussion of sex work ends with the description of two rapes suffered by Mary Barr. In the first, a police officer chased off her client and then told her she might as well have sex with him because the client had already paid. In the second, an officer ordered her into the back seat of his car, told her "do what you do best," and then raped her.

Best Practices Policy Project, Desiree Alliance, and Sex Workers Outreach Project- NYC

2014-09-15

This was submitted as part of the UN Universal Periodic Review of the U.S.A.

During arrest or taking someone into custody, police often degrade or humiliate sex workers, including removing wigs or clothing, confiscating or destroying property, making homophobic, anti-transgender, and racists slurs, and engaging on sexual harassment. Organizations working with sex workers have documented a pattern of police practice that includes assault, sexual harassment, public strip searches for the purpose of viewing genitalia, and rape. This pattern of practice is supported by the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining justice in these cases. 

Police are able to extend this abuse from sex workers to trans women and women of color by profiling them as sex workers. A study in Los Angeles of Latina trans women found that 42% reported being solicited for sex by law enforcement and 24% reported being sexually abused by police officers.

When sex workers try to report crimes against them, officers don't take their complaints seriously, refuse to file a report, and may arrest them, physically assault them, or pressure them for sex. When a sex worker tried to bring charges against a security guard who handcuffed and raped her, the police referred to the guard as "a big teddy bear", and added exculpatory statements to her report that she didn't make. This refusal to deal with crimes against sex workers leads serial killers to target sex workers and people profiled as sex workers.

While most witnesses who are in danger because of their testimony are put in witness protection programs, sex workers are pressured to testify by putting them in jail, exposing them to witness intimidation and denying them their right to liberty. An African-American trans female sex worker was placed in the mens' jail in Baltimore in an effort to compel her to testify in a violent crime case. Police in some areas force sex workers to participate in drug stings, exposing them to violence from the people targeted by the stings.

In New York, transgender and gender non-conforming people are often profiled as sex workers and arrested. They then have to decide whether to request being held as a "special category" prisoner. If they make the request, police are often harsh, holding them alone in a back cell longer than usual or assaulting them. If no empty cells are available, police chain them to a desk or metal bar, often for hours at a time. If they don't make the request, they may be put in a cell where they aren't safe, or the police may incite trouble with the other prisoners by saying "here's another [anti-LGBT slur] for you."

Police discourage the use of condoms by using condoms as evidence, or they destroy condoms and safe sex supplies. This encourages the spread of HIV and STIs. Carrying condoms may also be a signal for sexual harassment, cuing police to ask intrusive questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, touch inappropriately, and make disparaging comments. Police particularly target young women of color and trans youth and gender non-conforming youth of color.

Sex workers with severe injuries from violent attacks are often belittled and blamed for the attacks, and police often don't escort them or refer them to medical care. People in medical facilities seeking care for injuries from attacks have been accusingly questioned by police officers when they were profiled as sex workers.

The study sample consisted of fifteen woman who were sex workers, trafficked victims, or both.

Six of the twelve women who had been trafficking victims left their trafficking situation without help from law enforcement, through the help of a coworker or an attorney they met through a coworker or friend. Nationwide, it appears that the majority of trafficking victims escape without the involvement of law enforcement. One supervisor in a national organization said that 90% of their cases were not produced by raids or identified by law enforcement.

(N.b. Most people who fit the legal definition of trafficking victim seem to exit trafficking without any organizational help. In a study of underage sex workers in NYC, only 2% said they would ever go to a service organization if they were in trouble.&lt;ref name="curtisNYC"/&gt; On the whole, they age out of sex work rather than being "rescued." Young sex workers studied in NYC and Atlantic City experienced greater control over their work over time, regardless of whether they had pimps.

| author= Marcus, et al
| date= 2014-03-28
| format= PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, it appears that the majority of people who fall under the category of trafficking victim exit the category through their own efforts. Only a minority of trafficking victims exit trafficking with help from organizations created to help them. Of that minority, only a further minority, perhaps 10%, are identified by law enforcement. And this study suggests that most of the people picked up in raids could have been rescued or self-rescued in other, less traumatic ways, had they been aware of the help available to them.)

Of the six trafficking victims picked up in law enforcement raids, one would have left her situation in a few days if she had not been picked up in a raid and arrested. As a result of the raid, she was pistol-whipped by a police officer and incarcerated. Her conclusion:

{{ quote
| text= A better way to help leave my situation would be anything that didn't involve the police.
}}

Another would have left on her own if she had known where to go, and another said that she would have preferred leaving with a coworker rather than being picked up in a raid. One didn't know another way to escape, but still thought the raid was "terrible." Had these women known of the resources available to trafficked people, they very likely could have left on their own and gotten the assistance they needed without the trauma or injury of a raid.

Raids often involve intimidation, verbal abuse, excessive force, and sexual harassment. Raids result in detention and deportation of trafficking victims who are afraid to come forward, or who come forward and aren't believed. Victims who aren't detained or deported are often terrorized into silence. 

The respondents who experienced raids didn't know which government agency was raiding them, and in one case initially knew only that they were being attacked by people carrying guns. They didn't know what purpose the raids had, other than to detain and deport them, and they didn't know what was going to happen to them.

The women who left trafficking situations on their own, without being traumatized by a law enforcement raid, were better able to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers.

The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

'''Rare biosphere''' refers to diverse rare species of [[bacteria]], adapted to environmental conditions that are not common today.

==Microbial ecosystems==
[[File:Microbial Loop.jpg|thumb|Schematic of the microbial loop.]]
Changes in the [[biodiversity]] of an [[ecosystem]], whether [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] or [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]], may affect its efficiency and function. [[Climate change]] or other [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic perturbations]] can decrease [[productivity]] and disrupt global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s. The possible ramifications of such changes are not well characterized or understood, and up to a point redundancy in an ecosystem may protect it from disruption.&lt;ref name="Gitay"&gt;{{cite report |editor1-first=Habiba|editor1-last=Gitay  |editor2-first=Avelino|editor2-last=Suárez |editor3-first=David Jon |editor3-last=Dokken |editor4-first=Robert T.|editor4-last=Watson |date=April 2002 |title=Climate Change and Biodiversity: IPCC Technical Paper V |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/technical-papers/climate-changes-biodiversity-en.pdf |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of [[Microbial ecology|microbial ecosystems]] are tightly coupled to biogeochemical processes.&lt;ref name=Kirchman&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kirchman| editor-first1=David L.|title=Microbial Ecology of the Oceans.|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken|isbn=0470281839|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the marine [[microbial loop]], bacteria [[decomposition|decompose]] organics and [[Nutrient cycle|recycle nutrients]] such as [[nitrogen]] for other organisms such as [[phytoplankton]] to use.&lt;ref name=Kirchman/&gt; A reduction in recycled nitrogen would limit the production rate of phytoplankton, in turn limiting the growth of [[Grazing|grazers]], with effects throughout the [[food web]] and [[nitrogen cycle]]. To gauge such effects, a base line of microbial diversity is needed.

==DNA sequencing==
Recent use of high-throughput [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] techniques, pioneered by [[Mitchell Sogin|Dr. Mitchell Sogin]] of the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], has broadened the scope of biodiversity, with the discovery of the rare biosphere.&lt;ref name=Sogin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sogin|first1=M.

Alternatively [[high throughput sequencing]], “tag sequencing”, divides unique [[rRNA]] tag sequences into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs) based upon similarities in [[mitochondria]]l-encoded [[cytochrome oxidase]]s.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Both Sanger, [[shot gun sequencing]], and [[tag sequencing]] organize sequences into OTUs.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt; However, it is the resolution that tag sequencing provides that sets it apart, resulting from the increased efficiency in serial analysis.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt; This efficiency increase is made possible through the use of internal [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] sequences resulting in [[restriction digest]] overhanging sequences.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt;  Though OTUs provide a means of distinguishing the possible number of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] groups, it is not possible to deduce phylogenetic relationships based upon OTU’s. Tags associated with OTUs must be cross-referenced with [[gene bank]]s, in order for tags to be phylotyped and relationships established.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;

The result of tag sequencing has been to produce orders of magnitude larger estimates of OTUs present in ecosystems, producing a [[long tail]] on [[Relative abundance distribution|species abundance curves]].&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=D. J.|title=Seeing the Big Picture on Microbe Distribution|journal=Science|date=17 September 2009|volume=325|issue=5947|pages=1506–1507|doi=10.1126/science.1179690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; This long tail accounts for less than .1% of the abundant species in a particular ecosystem. At the same time it represents thousands of populations accounting for most of the phylogenetic diversity in an ecosystem. This low-abundance high-diversity group is the rare biosphere. Using this method, Sogin et al.’s study of microbial diversity in [[North Atlantic]] deep water produced an estimate of 5266 different [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; This is particularly dramatic considering that previous studies employing more traditional [[PCR]] [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] techniques have resulted in estimates of up to 500.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt;

== Ecological role ==
Considering their low abundance, members of the rare biosphere may represent ancient and persistent taxa.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; As these less abundant species are limited in number viral infection, and ultimately death by [[lysis]], is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; Viruses depend on high concentrations of hosts to persist. Additionally being less abundant implies limited growth, and on the smaller end of the cell size spectrum.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; This limits the likelihood of death by ingestion, as grazers prefer larger more active microbes. As well it is important to note that just because these taxa are “rare” now does not mean that under previous conditions in our planet’s history they were “rare”.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; These taxa could be have been episodically abundant, resulting in global changes in biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Essentially this requires microbial ecologists to change their perspective on how microbial interactions function on evolutionary time scales.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;

On that note, rare today does not mean rare tomorrow. Given the persistence of these taxa under the right conditions they have the potential to dominate, and become the more abundant taxa.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; The occurrence of such conditions may occur on many temporal scales. It may be possible that some rare taxa dominate only during anomalous years, such as during [[El Niño]].&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt; While, a four-year study by Brown et al. in species abundance in a single marine ecosystem found that some taxa were undetectable during some months and accounted for a couple percent of the total abundance other months.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Mark V.|last2=Schwalbach|first2=Michael S.|last3=Hewson|first3=Ian|last4=Fuhrman|first4=Jed A.|title=Coupling 16S-ITS rDNA clone libraries and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis to show marine microbial diversity: development and application to a time series|journal=Environmental Microbiology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=9|pages=1466–1479|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00835.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indicating that a change in abundance may occur on a seasonal scale. Recent global climate change may provide some of these rare taxa with the conditions necessary to increase in abundance.
Even in their low abundance taxa belonging to the rare biosphere may be affecting global biogeochemical cycles. For example, most of nitrogen fixation was attributed to Trichodesmium and abundant cyanobacterium. However, more recent evidence implicates that the rare minority may be responsible for fixing more cumulative Nitrogen than the abundant majority.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;

A subtle and less direct manner these populations may be affecting ecosystems, in terms of biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, is by acting as an unlimited source of genetic diversity and material.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; How microbial communities present resilience after environmental perturbation or catastrophe and how closely a closely related species may present unique and novel genetic attributes compared to near relatives, are topics of much discussion and investigation.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;  The rare biosphere could be a seed bank, transferring genes resulting in fitter recombinants that rise to become the dominant majority.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Until now this group has been overlooked entirely, and may be the answer to many longstanding questions concerning microbial ecology and genetics.

== Biogeography and distribution ==
There is some debate concerning the distribution of taxa within the rare biosphere. Taxa within this group at a given site may be in the process of dispersal.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Studies in the Arctic seabed identified thermophilic bacteria, arriving through mechanisms of dispersal, that could not be metabolically active.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Once these populations, such as the thermophilic bacteria in the Arctic, reach a suitable niche they will again become metabolically active and increase in abundance. This requires that one view these populations as non-discrete, not endemic to any one particular body of water.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Rather view populations as continuous throughout the oceans. Alternatively, studies suggest that given the biogeography of rare taxa the idea of the rare biosphere being the product of dispersal seems unlikely.&lt;ref name=Galand&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galand|first1=P. E.|last2=Casamayor|first2=E. O.|last3=Kirchman|first3=D. L.|last4=Lovejoy|first4=C.|title=Ecology of the rare microbial biosphere of the Arctic Ocean|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=17 December 2009|volume=106|issue=52|pages=22427–22432|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908284106|url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/21166/1/0908284106.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galand et al. completed a study in the Arctic Ocean on the biogeography of the rare biosphere and found that between parcels of water within that ocean the rare biosphere presented a large amount of diversity.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Suggesting that populations within the rare biosphere experience evolutionary forces specific to the location they are found such as selection, speciation, and extinction.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Asserting that water masses have physical boundaries resulting in highly evolved and divergent taxa between rare biospheres from different locations.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Also, given the fact that many rare taxa cannot be identified in gene banks, it seems unlikely that they abundant elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Though this statement is difficult to validate, due to the extreme under sampling of marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt;

The '''Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute'''  is an Iranian pharmaceutical company. It is located in the [[Hesarak (Karaj)|Hessarak]] district in [[Karaj]], [[Iran]]. The Institute was built as a national center with the purpose of countering [[epidemics]] in domestic animals during [[Reza Shah]] era. Further departments were installed, including those dedicated to human medicines. In modern years, the Institute has focused primarily on [[nanomedicine]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=NTI&gt;http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/iran/biological/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3558225 | pmid=23407888 | volume=4 | title=Medical biotechnology trends and achievements in iran | year=2012 | journal=Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology | pages=200–5 | last1 = Mahboudi | first1 = F | last2 = Hamedifar | first2 = H | last3 = Aghajani | first3 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is known for its [[anti-venom]] serums derived from [[snake]] and [[scorpion]] [[venoms|venom]]. It hosts some reference pharmaceutical laboratories with regional or state scopes.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7766">'''Robert Emmanuel "Bob" Hecht, Jr.''' (3 June 1919 – 8 February 2012) was an American [[antiquities]] [[art dealer]] based in Paris.

He was on [[trial]] in Italy from 2005 to just before his death in 2012, on charges of conspiring to traffic in [[Looted antiquities|looted antiquities artifacts]].

==Personal life==
Robert Hecht was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. He was a descendant of the family that founded [[The Hecht Company]], a chain of department stores based in Baltimore, where he grew up.

He graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1941, having majored in [[Latin]], was a naval officer during World War II, and after it spent a stint as interpreter at the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Investigation in Nuremberg]] and one year at the University of [[Zurich]] studying archaeology and classical philology before winning a [[Rome Prize]] Fellowship for the [[American Academy in Rome]] (1947–49).

In 1953 he married Elizabeth Chase, a graduate student of the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]]. Robert Hecht had three daughters: Daphne Howat by his first marriage to Anita Liebman; and Andrea and Donatella Hecht by his marriage to Ms. Chase. He lived for many years in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and died at home there.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Bruce. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/arts/design/robert-hecht-antiquities-dealer-dies-at-92.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1/ Robert Hecht, Antiquities Dealer, Dies at 92]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. 19 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hecht made his first significant sales in the 1950s, including the dispersal of the collection of Ludwig Curtius, former director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] in Rome, and later the sale of a late 6th century BCE red figure vase to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. In the 1960s and 1970s he reached a pre-eminent position in the trade. Known throughout the museum world for his scholarship and his 'eye' for antiquities,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} he sold to all the world's major museums including the [[British Museum]], the [[Louvre]], the Metropolitan, the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], Boston, and to many private collectors all over the world. Other dealers tended to give him first refusal on their 'finds'. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

It was a period when major museums and serious collectors in Europe, the U.S., and Japan did not feel it their responsibility to enforce the export laws of southern European countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Hecht always worked on the assumption that it was the preservation and study of ancient art that really mattered, not [[provenance]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In the 1970s [[Bruce McNall]] was his "secret United States partner."&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, Thomas, ''Making the Mummies Dance'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-73854-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provenance issues===
The sale of a [[Euphronios krater]] to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for $1 million in 1972 catapulted Hecht into instant fame and international problems. The Italians claimed that the vase was excavated illegally in [[Cerveteri]], north of [[Rome]]. An American [[Grand Jury]], investigating the [[Euphronios krater]] at the request of the Italians &amp;mdash; whose evidence came from a tomb robber &amp;mdash; found the provenance unproven. However, in 2006, continuing pressure from Italy led [[Philippe de Montebello]], director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to negotiate a deal which gave the Italians ownership of the vase.

Hecht had wrangles with both the Italian and Turkish authorities but was acquitted in the only lawsuit to reach Italy's [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] (Suprema Corte di Cassazione).

====J. Paul Getty Museum controversy====
In 2005 Hecht was indicted by the Italian government, together with [[Marion True]], the former curator of antiquities at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, for conspiracy to traffic in [[illegal antiquities]]. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts.

Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref name= "MV"&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Medici was sentenced in 2004 by a Rome court to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million [[euro]]s, "the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy".&lt;ref name= "MV"/&gt;

The court hearings of the case against Hecht and True ended in 2012 and 2010, respectively, as the statute of limitations, under Italian law, for their alleged crimes had expired.&lt;ref&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta.

Spirangles are similar to spirals in that they expand from a center point as they grow larger, but they are made out of straight [[line segment]]s, instead of curves. Spirangle [[vectograph]]s are used in vision therapy to promote [[stereopsis]] and help resolve problems with [[hand–eye coordination]].

==Two-dimensional spirangles==
A two-dimensional spirangle is an open figure consisting of a line bent into angles similar to a corresponding [[polygon]].  The spirangle can start at a center point, or a distance from the center, and has some number of turns around the center point.

==Three-dimensional spirangles==
Three-dimensional spirangles have layers that slant upward, progressively gaining height from the previous segment.  This is similar to staircases in large buildings that turn at the top of each flight.  The segments also may progressively lose an amount of length and resemble a pyramid.

==Uses==

[[Ophthalmology]] – vectograms

[[Electronics]] – printed [[inductor]]s

[[Architecture]] – ‘spiral’ [[staircase]]s

[[Jewelry]] – earrings, pendants

[[Search Algorithm]]s - efficient scanning of a region of interest (crime scenes, astronomical regions, etc.)

The general objectives of '''strategic urban planning''' (SUP) include clarifying which [[city]] model is desired and working towards that goal, coordinating public and private efforts, channelling energy, adapting to new circumstances and improving the living conditions of the citizens affected.

Strategic planning is a technique that has been applied to many facets of human activity; we have only to mention [[Sun Tzu]], Arthur Thomson or [[Henry Mintzberg]]; however, the application of strategic planning to urban contexts, or cities, regions and other [[metropolitan areas]] is a relatively recent development whose beginnings were eminently practical and artistical: a mixture of thought, techniques and art or expertise.

Fifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in [[Barcelona]] in 1993, included the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Community]] Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of [[Amsterdam]], [[Lisbon]], [[Lille]], Barcelona, [[Toronto]] and [[Santiago de Chile]] participated, among others.

At that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.

== History==
Strategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of [[San Francisco]] (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of [[Spain]], crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.

== Description of SUP processes==
An SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:

''The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State and Local Government should mean the instigation of regulations, investment, administrative measures, policy initiatives, etc) but rather a policy contract between public institutions and civil society. For this reason, the process following the approval of the plan and the monitoring and implementation of measures or actions is just as or more important than the process of elaboration and consensual approval.''

SUP is now considered a type of [[Governance]].

== Basic Stages of an SUP process==
* Using the work of the Technical Secretary as a starting point, work groups debate and approve a diagnosis of the city that includes its localisation. The document must be approved by the Executive Committee, by the General Council or a full meeting of the Corporation as the case may be.
* Based on the diagnosis, and keeping in mind its antecedents and conclusions, strengths and weaknesses, the next step is the creation of scenarios and, based on the use of imagination and rigour, the development of prospective tasks related to the creation of future alternatives so that the Executive Committee can select a model or vision for the city. Their choice will be the basis for the generation of related key topics and/or directions for general actions to be taken.
* Once the work teams have been reorganized, mainly made up of key decision-makers and implementers, each key topic and line of action will be dealt with separately, designing a detailed list of necessary and/or advisable projects. Once the results have been consolidated, a prioritised list of projects will be made available from which a selection will be made. The next step is the elaboration of an action plan that includes the agents involved, timing and resources. The people involved in the structure of the process, at least theoretically, are capable of carrying it out; for an example, please consult the document from the General Council of SUP of Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm].
* Once all of the previously mentioned documents have been approved, the next step is implementation - carrying out the project itself. This stage is decisive; at this point plans are usually given a structure in which the organization is even more explicitly clarified.

== Implementation of SUP processes==
The social and economic importance of these processes is quite relevant as they affect millions of people [https://web.archive.org/web/20050101023909/http://www.cideu.org/site/] . In Spain, [http://www.ebropolis.es/web/index.asp] there are nearly one hundred localities that use this methodology, affecting a total population of nearly 15 million people.

== Critical Comments on SUP processes==
Sectors in the area of civic participation, as well as planning professionals and political activists have all expressed criticism of SUP processes.

However, SUP processes include aspects that favour selective participation, territorial organization and coordination/cooperation between public and private sectors. On the other hand, Strategic Urban Planning processes seem to be independent of political ideologies (for example, the SUP processes in Barcelona [http://www.bcn2000.es/en/default_en.aspx], Bilbao [http://www.bm30.es/] and Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm] are carried out with mixed Government teams including the following Spanish political formations: PSC-PSOE  [http://www.socialistes.cat/home/], PNV [http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/] and PP [http://www.pp.es/] respectively) and can produce a notable degree of stability in the majority behind the project.

== Theoretical Development==
Knowledge relating to strategic urban planning processes is evolving in two complementary directions that can be denominated, borrowing concepts from programming, as Bottom-Up and Top-down.

=== Bottom-Up===
There are clear differences between what could be called the traditional approach to Strategic planning and the emerging approach (Fernández Güell. Strategic planning of cities).
* Before Product predominance, now Process predominance
* Before Sector specific, now Integrated
* Before Normative, now Strategic
* Before Goal-oriented, now Cost-benefit oriented
* Before Urban-offer oriented, now Urban-demand oriented
* Before Subject to administrative limitations, now Supersedes administrative limitations and enters in Metropolitan areas
* Before Open participation, now Focused Participation

Of course, in 2006 there was a clear evolution that attempted to adapt to changes, political sensitivities and even trends. In any case, this is a line of thought and action that takes full advantage of the experience of projects that have already been implemented.

=== Top-Down===
Given that:
* The influence of each agent in the global process under consideration for implementation is yet to be determined;
* There are no generally accepted criteria when creating instruments for measuring progress or regression on the path toward achieving main goals;
* Cooperation processes among different agents within the city to carry out strategic planning are usually undertaken using a “framework” organisational structure which highlights differences;
* Both politics and outside events affect a large city;

this line of research seeks to further the design of a model that will determine the factors related to the success of strategic planning processes in large cities and metropolitan areas [https://web.archive.org/web/20090727100029/http://alarcos.inf-cr.uclm.es/per/fruiz/audes5/index.htm] [[:es:Aglomeraciones urbanas en la Unión Europea]] [[:es:Area Metropolitana]] [[:es:Área metropolitana de Valencia]].

Within this branch of research, which seeks a more general theory, two recent Doctoral Theses mentioned in the bibliography can be consulted for further information.

It should be pointed out that a theory explaining Strategic Urban Planning in Metropolitan Areas and/or Regions would involve furthering the consolidation of Social Design [[:es:Diseño Social]] as a scientific study.

'''''The Erotic Review''''', also functioning as '''TheEroticReview.com''', is a [[review site]] that ostensibly presents clients' assessments of their experiences with [[sex workers]] (referred to as "providers" on the website).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/news/features/sex/2012/johns-and-escorts-mixer/

==History==
The service was first launched in 1999 by David Elms, who came up with the idea after having what he described as a "bad encounter" with a [[call girl]].&lt;ref name="RFT"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-06-04/news/oldest-profession-2-0-a-new-generation-of-local-providers-and-hobbyists-create-a-virtual-red-light-district/

''The Erotic Review'' website was acquired by Treehouse Park in 2004.&lt;ref name=leaves&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Edward|title=Troubled Elms Leaves Erotic Review|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Troubled-Elms-Leaves-Erotic-Review-306112.html|publisher=AVN|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis|title=Johns Help Each Other Find the Right 'Internet Sex Provider'|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2008/03/internet_johns|publisher=Wired|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act#FOSTA-SESTA Package|Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act]]; following this and the FBI shutting down [[Backpage]] and other websites promoting or facilitating in prostitution, The Erotic Review blocked access to its site from the United States, though can still be accessed in the United States via a [[Virtual private network|VPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/erotic-review-blocks-us-internet-users-to-prepare-for-government-crackdown/|title="Erotic Review" blocks US Internet users to prepare for government crackdown – Ars Technica|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2018-04-09|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2018, The Erotic Review was mentioned in a superseding indictment filed by the government against Backpage.com. The superseding indictment alleges that Backpage and The Erotic Review had a reciprocal link agreement, where both parties allowed ads to be posted on their sites. The indictment alleges that Backpage paid “tens of thousands” of dollars to The Erotic Review for this agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/wireStory/indictment-levels-charges-backpage-officials-56874244|title=Indictment levels new charges against Backpage.com officials - ABC News|work=[[ABC News]]|date=2018-07-27|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4618737-Indictment-Superseding.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and readership==
A 2008 ''[[River Front Times]]'' article features Elms commenting that the average site-user was "between 35 and 55 years old with a median income of $80,000".&lt;ref name="RFT" /&gt;

''The Erotic Review'' hosts reviews for over 90 cities around the world.&lt;ref name=leaves/&gt; The site offers both a free and paid membership. Free members can access site features such as the [[discussion boards]] and a limited search function. Paid members have additional features such as the ability to access complete reviews and a search page that allows the user to search based on various criteria such as physical attributes.

==Criticism==
The site has been met with criticism, most of which centered upon its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Melissa Gira|title=Online critics accuse TheEroticReview.com CEO Dave Elms of rape|url=http://gawker.com/389612/online-critics-accuse-theeroticreviewcom-ceo-dave-elms-of-rape|publisher=Gawker|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have claimed that Elms has accepted bribes to promote certain agencies or call girls and has pressured others into providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=Prostitution Site Cuts Ties With Founder After Charges|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/prostitution-site-cuts-ties-with-founder-after-charges/|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have made claims of Elms threatening them with bodily harm for criticizing the site or refusing to provide sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Jennifer|title=Prostitution Review Site Breaks Up with Founder|url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/news-events/273448-prostitution-review-site-breaks-up-with-founder|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nix|first=Denise|title=Prostitution king sought|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_11989964|publisher=Daily Breeze|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elms denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sex Trade Monitors a Key Figure’s Woes | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 17, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/17erotic.html | first=Matt | last=Richtel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have expressed "frustration" over the company's association with law enforcement, stating that the site should be warning escorts and/or users if someone is a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10896432/

''The Erotic Review'' distanced itself from Elms in 2009 and cut ties with him after Elms was arrested in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], for hiring a [[hit man]] to assault a business rival, and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison that same year.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

'''''The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?''''' is a 1984 [[book]] written by British [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Eileen Barker]], [[Blackwell's|Blackwell Publishers]], Oxford, United Kingdom, {{ISBN|0-631-13246-5}}.

The book describes the [[religious conversion]] process to the [[Unification Church]], whose members are sometimes informally referred to as "[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonies]]".

Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members.  She interviewed in depth and/or gave probing questionnaires to Unification Church members, ex-members, "non-joiners," and control groups of uninvolved individuals from similar backgrounds, as well as parents, spouses, and friends of members. She also attended numerous Unification Church workshops and communal facilities.&lt;ref name="Rusher"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4580948 Review], [[William Rusher]], ''[[National Review]]'', December 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker writes that she rejects the "[[brainwashing]]" theory as an explanation for conversion to the Unification Church, because, as she wrote, it explains neither the many people who attended a Unification Church recruitment meeting and did not become members, nor the voluntary disaffiliation of members. Reviewers have quoted her conclusions: "I have not been persuaded that they are brainwashed zombies,"&lt;ref name="Rusher" /&gt; and "Moonies are no more likely to stagnate into mindless robots than are their peers who travel to the city on the 8.23 each morning."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060618211708/http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/diskus/chryssides.html NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS - SOME PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION] [[George Chryssides]], ''Diskus'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Laurence Iannaccone]] of [[George Mason University]], a specialist in the [[theory of religious economy|economics of religion]], wrote that ''The Making of a Moonie'' was "one of the most comprehensive and influential studies" of the process of conversion to [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RALi/The%20Market%20for%20Martyrs.pdf The Market for Martyrs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111212356/http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RALi/The%20Market%20for%20Martyrs.pdf |date=2012-01-11 }}, [[Laurence Iannaccone]], [[George Mason University]], 2006, "One of the most comprehensive and influential studies was The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing? by Eileen Barker (1984). Barker could find no evidence that Moonie recruits were ever kidnapped, confined, or coerced. Participants at Moonie retreats were not [[deprived of sleep]]; the lectures were not “trance-inducing”; and there was not much chanting, no drugs or alcohol, and little that could be termed “frenzy” or “ecstatic” experience. People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of “brainwashing”), fewer than 25% joined the group formore than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand. And this was one of the most New Religious Movements of the era!"&lt;/ref&gt; Australian psychologist Len Oakes and British psychiatry professor [[Anthony Storr]], who have written rather critically about [[cult]]s, [[guru]]s, [[new religious movement]]s, and their leaders have praised ''The Making of a Moonie''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len "By far the best study of the conversion process is Eileen Barker’s The Making of a Moonie [...]" from ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storr, Anthony Dr. ''Feet of clay: a study of gurus'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-684-83495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given the Distinguished Book Award for 1985 by the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm Past Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nkN0WHJc?url=http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm |date=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rise of Christianity''''' (subtitled either '''''A Sociologist Reconsiders History''''' or '''''How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries''''', depending on the edition), is a book by the sociologist [[Rodney Stark]], which examines the rise of [[Christianity]], from a small movement in [[Galilee]] and [[Judea]] at the (supposed) time of Jesus to the majority religion of the [[Roman Empire]] a few centuries later.

==Summary==
Stark argues that contrary to popular belief, Christianity was not a movement of the lower classes and the oppressed but instead of the upper and middle classes in the cities and of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jews]]. Stark also discusses the exponential nature of the growth of religion.

Stark points to a number of advantages that Christianity had over [[paganism]] to explain its growth:

*While others fled cities, Christians stayed in urban areas during plague, ministering and [[Beatitudes|caring for the sick]].
*Christian populations grew faster because of the prohibition of [[birth control]], [[abortion]] and [[infanticide]]. Since infanticide tended to affect female newborn more frequently, early Christians had a more even sex ratio and therefore a higher percentage of childbearing women than pagans.
*To the same effect: Women were valued higher and allowed to participate in worship leading to a high rate of female converts.
*In a time of two epidemics (165 and 251) which killed up to a third of the whole population of the Roman Empire each time, the Christian message of redemption through sacrifice offered a more satisfactory explanation of why bad things happen to innocent people. Further, the tighter social cohesion and mutual help made them able to better cope with the disasters, leaving them with fewer casualties than the general population. This would also be attractive to outsiders, who would want to convert. Lastly, the epidemics left many non-Christians with a reduced number of interpersonal bonds, making the forming of new one both necessary and easier.
*Christians did not fight against their persecutors by open violence or guerrilla warfare but willingly went to their [[martyrdom]] while praying for their captors, which added credibility to their evangelism.

Stark's basic thesis is that, ultimately, Christianity triumphed over paganism because it improved the quality of life of its adherents at that time.

==Reception==

"Stark has produced a provocative, insightful, challenging account of the rise of Christianity. The thesis—that Christianity was a success because it provided those who joined it with a more appealing, more assuring, happier, and perhaps longer life—may anger many readers and force all readers to stop and think. It is a marvelous exercise in the sociological imagination and a warning to those who like simple explanations--such as that Constantine was ultimately responsible for the success of Christianity when he made it the official religion of the Roman Empire" ([[Andrew M. Greeley]], [[National Opinion Research Center]], [[University of Chicago]]).&lt;ref name=stark&gt;{{cite book | title     = The Rise of Christianity   |at=back cover | author       = [[Rodney Stark]]

"For years, biblical scholars and church historians have used sociological jargon to promote ideological views. Now an established sociologist has entered the fray with devastating results. This brilliant and highly provocative book will revolutionize the way people think about both biblical studies and church history. Love it or hate it, Rodney Stark's ''The Rise of Christianity'' is a book nobody interested in the study of religion can ignore" ([[Irving Hexham]], [[University of Calgary]]).&lt;ref name=stark/&gt;

==In the media==
This book prominently featured within the storyline of ''[[Hidden Empire]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], according to the book's [[afterword]], and ''The Rise of Christianity'' even inspired the book's plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hidden Empire | author = [[Orson Scott Card]] | series = [[The Empire Duet]]

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s – for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421–24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Pietá'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">A '''tronie''' (16/17th-century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "face") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] that shows an exaggerated [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume.

==Definition==
[[File:Joos van Craesbeeck - The Smoker.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'', an example of a "tronie"]]
The term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'.  More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel.  In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person.  When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.&lt;ref name=tronie&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001200101_01/_zev001200101_01_0017.php Jan Muylle, ''Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel''], in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 17. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 2001, p. 174-203 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of [[genre painting]] in a portrait format.  Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters.  The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as [[portrait]]s normally were.  Similar unidentified figures treated as [[history painting]]s would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as ''Saskia as Flora''.

==History==
The genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo.  Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity.  This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries.  In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] that followed this paired arrangement.&lt;ref name=tronie/&gt;

This paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century.  For instance, the Flemish artist [[Jan van de Venne]] who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.

File:Jan van der Venne - Head of an old woman.jpg|Jan van de Venne, ''Head of an old woman''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several [[Rembrandt]] [[self-portrait]] [[etching]]s are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;This is true of modern art-historical terminology; however, historical usage is not so precise. Seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish inventories of paintings might use the term for any unidentified sitter.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Three [[Vermeer]] paintings were described as "tronies" in the [[Jacob Dissius|Dissius]] auction of 1696, perhaps including the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and the Washington ''[[:File:Johannes Vermeer - Young Girl with a Flute - WGA24683.jpg|Young Girl with a flute]]''.  [[Frans Hals]] also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as ''[[Malle Babbe]]'' and the ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]'' (see gallery).

[[Adriaen Brouwer]] was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure.   His ''Youth Making a Face'' (c. 1632/1635, [[National Gallery of Art]]) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.86204.html Brouwer, Adriaen, ''Youth Making a Face''] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are  [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]'s ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' and [[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'' which represents taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/record=b1202823 ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' by [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]] at the [[Wellcome Library]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

The tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the "portrait historié", a portrait of a real person '''as''' another, usually historical or [[mythological]], figure. [[Jan de Bray]] specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.

'''William Leonard Pereira''' (April 25, 1909 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1985) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry&lt;ref name=wpereira&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Portuguese-Americans.html William L Pereira at (www.everyculture.com/) Portuguese Americans]&lt;/ref&gt; who was noted for his [[Futurist architecture#Post-modern futurism|futuristic]] designs of landmark buildings such as the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Remarkably prolific, he worked out of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and was known for his love of [[science fiction]] and expensive cars, but mostly for his unmistakable style of [[architecture]], which helped define the look of mid-20th century [[United States|America]].

==Personal life==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Pereira graduated from the [[University of Illinois School of Architecture|School of Architecture, University of Illinois]] and began his [[career]] in his home city. He had some of his earliest architectural experience helping to draft the master plan for the 1933 "[[Century of Progress|A Century of Progress]]" [[World's Fair|Chicago World's Fair]]. With his brother, [[Hal Pereira]], he designed the Esquire Theater at 58 East Oak Street, considered one of Chicago's best examples of [[Art Deco]] style. 
[[Image:SanFrancisco DownTown.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco, 1972]]
He had two wives, former model and actress Margaret McConnell (married June 24, 1934) and Bronya Galef; the latter marriage ending with his death. He has two children, William Pereira, Jr., and a  daughter, Monica Pereira, a Spanish teacher.

William Pereira died of cancer at age 76 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles. At his request, no funeral services were planned.

==Career==

In the 1930s, he and Hal moved to Los Angeles. After working as a solo architect, Pereira was hired by the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]] and designed the first buildings for the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]], which was dedicated September 27, 1942.

Pereira also had a brief stint as a [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] art director. He shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]] for the action/adventure film ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]'' (1942).&lt;ref name="Oscars1943"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1943 |title=The 15th Academy Awards (1943) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-06-22 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the art director for "[[This Gun for Hire]]", Alan Ladd's first film.  He was production designer of the drama ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]), and of the war drama ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) . Pereira was also the [[film producer|producer]] of the [[film noir|noir]] crime/drama ''[[Johnny Angel]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]), and of the Joan Fontaine drama ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]).

Though his buildings were often quite stark and sterile in their appearance (owing largely to the science fiction of the era), they were noted for their functional style with a certain flair that made them unmistakable. He took pride in the concept of designing for the future.

In 1949, Pereira became a professor of architecture at the [[University of Southern California]]. He then formed a partnership with fellow architect and classmate, [[Charles Luckman]], in the early 1950s. The firm, [[Pereira &amp; Luckman]], grew into one of the nation's busiest. The duo designed some of Los Angeles's most well-known buildings, including the famed "[[Theme Building]]" at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (in collaboration with [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]] and [[Welton Becket]]).

[[Image:UCILibrary.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The library at [[University of California, Irvine]], illustrating Pereira's paneled facade system]]
He parted with Luckman in 1959. Afterward, he formed the third and final company of his career, "William L. Pereira &amp; Associates." In the 1960s and 1970s, he and his team completed over 250 projects, including drawing up the master plans for the Los Angeles International Airport expansion and developing the master plan for the 93,000 acre (376&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) city of [[Irvine, California]], which put his photograph on the cover of ''Time Magazine'' in September 1963. He later worked with [[Ian McHarg]] on the plan for the [[new town]] of [[The Woodlands, Texas]].

Pereira's buildings were easily identified by their unmistakable style, often taking unusual forms such as [[pyramid]]s and [[ziggurat]]s. They usually projected a grand presence, heavyset in appearance and often sitting atop "pedestals" that were themselves an integral part of the building. Many of his buildings were complemented by water features and some were almost entirely surrounded by water. The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], for instance, was a complex of three [[Googie]]-esque buildings rising up out of a lake and interconnected by a series of causeways and bridges.

Pereira designed the campus plans of the [[University of Southern California]], the [[University of California, Irvine]], and [[Pepperdine University]].

His material of choice in creating his unique geometric forms was pre-cast [[concrete]]. Working in this medium, he could create his impressive facades by simply attaching them as panels on to the steel frame of the building.

==Legacy==
By the time of his death, Pereira had over 400 projects to his name. Among the structures he designed throughout [[Southern California]] were [[CBS Television City]], [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]], the Los Angeles County Art Museum, the Howard Johnson Hotel and Water Playground in Anaheim, and the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. He is also responsible for creating the monumental Spanish-inspired facades that defined [[J. W. Robinson's|Robinson's]] department stores for nearly 20 years, and he was the architect of [[Pepperdine University]] at Malibu, named by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' as the most beautiful college campus in America. Out of his immense body of work, three have really stood out in the public mind: the master-planned cities of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

His most praised and criticized work was probably the Transamerica building, which was completed in 1972. It was first panned as an intrusion on the city's skyline, but has been accepted as having more character than the buildings around it and as being an oddly creative city symbol.

Perhaps his greatest lasting legacy besides his buildings are the numerous respected architects of today who came out of both Pereira's firm and the classes he taught at [[University of Southern California|USC]], including [[Gin D. Wong|Gin Wong]], [[William Blurock]], and [[Frank Gehry]]. Pereira's firm was taken over upon his death by his two primary cohorts, Scott Johnson and Bill Fain.

The '''Överkalix study''' ({{lang-sv|Överkalixstudien}}) was a study conducted on the physiological  effects of various environmental factors on [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational epigenetic]] inheritance. The study was conducted utilizing historical records, including [[harvests]] and food prices, in [[Överkalix]],  a small isolated [[municipality]] in northeast [[Sweden]]. The study was of 303 [[probands]], 164 men and 139 women, born in 1890, 1905, or 1920, and their 1,818 children and grandchildren. 44 were still alive in 1995 when mortality follow-up stopped. [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] risk ratios (RR) on children and grandchildren were determined based on available [[Food security|food supply]], as indicated by historical data.

Among the sex-specific effects noted; a greater [[body mass index]] (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters, of fathers who began smoking early. The paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons and not granddaughters. The paternal grandmother's  food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality risk ratio. The grandmother having a good food supply was associated with a twofold higher mortality (RR). 
This transgenerational inheritance was observed with exposure during the [[slow growth period]] (SGP). The SGP is the time before the start of [[puberty]], when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body. The ancestors' SGP in this study, was set between the ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls. This occurred in the SGP of both grandparents, or during the [[gestation]] period/infant life of the grandmothers, but not during either grandparent's puberty. The father's poor food supply and the mother's good food supply were associated with a lower risk of [[cardiovascular]] death.&lt;ref name="Lalande-1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lalande | first1 = M. | title = Parental imprinting and human disease. | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 30 | issue =  | pages = 173–95 | month =  | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.30.1.173 | PMID = 8982453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the female probands experienced a twofold higher mortality RR when the paternal grandmother had good food availability during her SGP, compared to the mortality risk of those whose paternal grandmothers had poor food supply during the SGP.

Using the same data, another investigation highlighted that a sharp change in food availability in paternal grandmothers' resulted in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in granddaughters adults' life.&lt;ref name="Bygren-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bygren | first1 = LO. | last2 = Tinghög | first2 = P. | last3 = Carstensen | first3 = J.  | last4 = Edvinsson | first4 = S.  | last5 = Kaati | first5 = G.  | last6 = Pembrey | first6 = ME.  | last7 = Sjöström | first7 = M.   | title = Change in paternal grandmothers' early food supply influenced cardiovascular mortality of the female grandchildren. | journal = BMC Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 12 |date=Feb 2014 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2156-15-12 | PMID = 24552514 | pmc=3929550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an effect was not observed in other grandparents. The grandparents were considered exposed if they experienced drastic change in their early life ranging from embryo to 13 years old.

Sex-specific effects can be due to parental imprinting a process that results in allele-specific differences in transcription, [[DNA methylation]], and [[DNA]] [[replication timing]]. Imprinting is an important process in human development, and its deregulation can cause certain defined disease states of other imprinted human disease loci. The establishment of parental imprints occurs  during [[gametogenesis]] as [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[DNA]] passes through [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|egg]]; subsequently during [[embryogenesis]] and into adulthood, [[alleles]] of imprinted genes are maintained in two "conformational"/epigenetic states: [[paternal]] or [[maternal]]. Thus, genomic imprints template their own replication, are heritable, can be identified by molecular analysis, and serve as markers of the parental origin of genomic regions.

The estimation of percentage of human genes subject to parental imprinting is approximately one to two percent, currently parental imprinting has been identified in fewer than 100 distinct named genes.&lt;ref name="Kaati-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kaati | first1 = G. | last2 = Bygren | first2 = LO. | last3 = Edvinsson | first3 = S. | title = Cardiovascular and diabetes mortality determined by nutrition during parents' and grandparents' slow growth period. | journal = Eur J Hum Genet | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 682–8 |date=Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200859 | PMID = 12404098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
